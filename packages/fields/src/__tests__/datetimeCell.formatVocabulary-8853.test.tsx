 * objectui#8853 — ONE authored `field.format`, one meaning, across the two
 * neighbouring date cell renderers.
 *
 * ## What was measured, before anything was changed
 *
 * Driven end to end through a REAL `ObjectGrid` column (not inferred from a
 * source read): one object with a `date` field and a `datetime` field, BOTH
 * authored `format: 'relative'`, one row, one instant
 * (`2026-09-11T09:30:00.000Z`), clock pinned to `2026-09-09T12:00:00.000Z`,
 * `en-US`. The grid's own body cells came back as
 *
 *   ["1Open", "Row One", "In 2 days", "Sep 11, 2026, 09:30 AM"]
 *                         ^ date       ^ datetime, same key, dropped
 *
 * and after the call-site mapping, as
 *
 *   ["1Open", "Row One", "In 2 days", "In 2 days"]
 *
 * The defect's whole signature is a SILENT drop — the runtime accepts the key,
 * parses it, drops it, and renders something that still looks like a
 * legitimate date — so a green suite proves nothing by itself. Every case
 * below therefore asserts a rendered FACE, with controls that say what the
 * probe would have shown had it been fooled.
 *
 * ## The controls, and why each one is here
 *
 * - **Positive control** — the `date` cell, in the SAME run, on the SAME
 *   instant. It already honoured `'relative'`, so it is what "honoured" looks
 *   like; without it, a datetime assertion could be measuring a broken clock
 *   or a dead locale channel rather than the vocabulary.
 * - **Negative control** — an OUT-OF-WINDOW value. `formatRelativeDate` falls
 *   back to the absolute form beyond ±7 days, so out there `format:
 *   'relative'` and no format at all render IDENTICALLY on the fully working
 *   `date` cell. That is the trap objectui#8352's card recorded: a probe built
 *   on an out-of-window value reports "identical" on a working path and on a
 *   broken one alike. The pin below asserts that collapse explicitly, so the
 *   in-window choice everywhere else is a measured decision rather than luck.
 *
 * ## Directions
 *
 * Reverting the call-site mapping in `DateTimeCellRenderer` turns the repro,
 * the `'short'` face and the out-of-window datetime face RED, and leaves every
 * control and regression pin GREEN — the controls measure surfaces this change
 * does not touch, which is exactly why they can vouch for the run. Widening
 * `formatDateTime`'s published signature instead (the refused route) turns the
 * "published signature untouched" pins RED. Adding a refusal for a spelling
 * that renders today turns the regression pins RED.
