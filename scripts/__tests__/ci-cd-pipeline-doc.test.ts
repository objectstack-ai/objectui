 * objectui#3197: `content/docs/guide/ci-cd-pipeline.md` described a bundle-size
 * regime that had not existed for a long time — a 60 KB console budget against a
 * workflow that enforces 350 KB (5.8x off), a `size-check.yml` workflow that has
 * never existed in this repository, and three package-size tiers printed under an
 * **Enforced limits** heading even though the step that emits them compares
 * nothing and never exits non-zero.
 *
 * Prose cannot be trusted to stay in sync with YAML by review alone — the number
 * had already drifted once and would drift again. So the doc is pinned to the
 * workflow here: change `MAX_ENTRY_GZIP_KB` (or the advisory tiers, or the set of
 * workflows the page names) without updating the page and this test fails.
 *
 * The dangerous direction is deliberately covered twice. A doc that *understates*
 * a gate is annoying; a doc that advertises a guardrail the CI does not have is
 * worse than no doc, because people make size decisions believing something will
 * stop them. Hence the last block: if anyone ever makes the size report actually
 * enforce those tiers, this test fails and points at the page that calls them
 * advisory.

   * ── The inventory table, and WHAT A ROW MUST ASSERT (objectui#8726) ─────────

   * until now the "Workflow Inventory" table was read by nothing at all. A workflow
   * satisfied `gives every workflow … its own section` purely by having a heading,
   * while its row could be absent, duplicated, or say the opposite of the truth.
   * Two mutations on the merged tree proved it, both green where they should have
   * been red: deleting `lockfile-integrity.yml`'s row while keeping its `##`
   * section, and rewriting `live-e2e.yml`'s trailing cell back to the stale
   * `continue-on-error` wording objectui#8692 had just removed.
   *
   * ⭐ The second one is why "does the row exist?" is not the whole answer. The page
   * asserts the `continue-on-error` claim about that lane in its structural-claims
   * bullet, and objectui#8084 took the property off the job — so the page could carry
   * a *contradiction with itself*, a corrected bullet beside an uncorrected row, and
   * stay green. Existence alone does not see that.
   *
   * ⭐ So a row must: (1) exist for every non-exempt workflow and name no other,
   * (2) appear exactly once, and (3) make no claim about a YAML property that the
   * workflow it names does not declare. Nothing more.
   *
   * ⛔ Deliberately NOT pinned: whether the free prose of `Runs on` and `Blocks a PR?`
   * is *correct*. Those cells carry real nuance ("every job but the two coverage-lane
   * jobs", "ESLint **errors** only") that no derivation reproduces, and the honest
   * source for a blocking answer is the repository's required-context set, which lives
   * in GitHub's settings and not in this tree. Deriving "Blocks a PR?" from a
   * `merge_group` trigger would be a *false* derivation in the direction that matters:
   * `hook-selftests.yml` declares none and the page rightly answers **Yes**. Pinning
   * more than the page can honestly promise is how a pin becomes the next card, so what
   * (3) checks is the narrow, mechanical thing — a named YAML key the row itself
   * invokes — the same discipline STRUCTURAL_BLOCKS below applies to the bullet.
   *
   * ⭐ The failure message above tells a contributor to add a heading **and a row**.
   * That last clause was advice no assertion enforced. It is enforced here now, so the
   * message and the assertions agree; ⛔ if these are ever retired, the clause goes too.

/**
 * objectui#3724: the `pnpm-lock.yaml` merge driver is repository configuration
 * (`.gitattributes`) that only works where something defines the driver, so "which
 * workflows define it" is a claim about three files at once — and it was wrong in both
 * copies that made it. This page named `changeset-release.yml` and
 * `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`; the deleted `.github/WORKFLOWS.md` named
 * `changeset-release.yml` and `changelog.yml`. Each omitted a different third, and both
 * read as complete.
 *
 * The content survived the deletion — the `.gitattributes` half and the add-it-to-a-new-
 * workflow half existed nowhere else — so it moved onto this page. Moving an already-drifted
 * hand-maintained list into unpinned prose would just relocate the drift generator, which is
 * the whole reason #3724 chose deletion over a second copy. Hence this pin: both directions,
 * so a workflow that gains the step without a row is as red as a row whose workflow lost it.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * objectui#6436 (ruled 2026-08-27) removed the LAST workflow that configured the driver.
 * `changeset-release.yml` performs no local merge, so its config could never fire; the
 * repository half (`.gitattributes`) and the contributor half (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) were
 * measured live and were kept. The mechanism is now contributor-facing with zero CI
 * consumers.
 *
 * ⭐ THE ANTI-VACUITY WEIGHT MOVED — IT DID NOT VANISH. This block used to open with
 * `expect(configuring.length).toBeGreaterThan(0)`, and that single line was doing two
 * different jobs:
 *
 *   1. proving the grep had matched something, so "no workflow is missing a row" was a
 *      reading rather than an artifact of a scan that read nothing; and
 *   2. proving the mechanism still had a consumer at all — a zero-match grep once let both
 *      directions of this pin go vacuously green, which is why the guard was added.
 *
 * Zero is now the CORRECT answer to that count, so the guard cannot stay as `> 0`. ⛔ But
 * flipping it to `=== 0` and stopping there would delete both jobs and re-install the exact
 * defect this block exists to catch. Each job therefore has a new and explicit owner:
 *
 *   1. → `the workflow scan is live` below. A zero-hit taken with no control is not a
 *      reading. The scan now takes a control term that MUST hit the same population —
 *      `git config`, which `changelog.yml` genuinely runs. If the directory, the read or
 *      the regex ever breaks, the control collapses to zero as well and that test fails,
 *      instead of a broken scan silently agreeing with the expected zero.
 *   2. → `keeps the .gitattributes half of the mechanism true` and `keeps CONTRIBUTING.md's
 *      contributor path — the mechanism's only remaining consumer` below. That is where the
 *      real weight landed: those two files ARE the mechanism now. If either goes, the driver
 *      genuinely has no consumers left and this section should be deleted with it — which is
 *      exactly what the old `> 0` failure message demanded, re-pointed at the consumer that
 *      is actually live.
 *
 * The both-directions pin itself stays, and the PHANTOM direction is now the load-bearing
 * half of it: with zero configuring workflows, `phantom` is precisely "workflows this page
 * still names", so a row that comes back reddens on its own. The `missing` direction is the
 * tripwire for a CI consumer returning.

/**
 * ── What a job RUNS, paired against the prose that documents it ──────────────
 *
 * objectui#3653 introduced this pairing for `ci.yml`'s job table. objectui#8015
 * lifted it out of that table, because the rule it encodes was never about a
 * table: *every first-party command a job runs must be named where this page
 * documents that job, and that documentation may not credit it with one the job
 * does not run.*
 *
 * Both directions are asserted, because the documentation is a claim in both: a
 * command the job runs and the page omits is a contributor who cannot learn from
 * this page that a gate exists; a command the page names and the job does not run
 * is the objectui#3451 shape one level down — a page advertising a guardrail that
 * is not there.
 *
 * The two sources differ only in WHERE the prose lives — one table cell per job
 * for `ci.yml`, one whole `##` section for `lint.yml`'s single job — so that is
 * the only thing a caller supplies. The rule itself is written once, here.
 *
 * What counts as a command is deliberately narrower than "every step", and the
 * boundary is *derived* rather than hand-listed: a step counts when it names
 * something this repository owns — a `scripts/*.mjs` file, a script in the root
 * `package.json`, or a `turbo run` task. Environment setup drops out on its own
 * because it names none of those (`corepack enable`, `pnpm --version`, `pnpm
 * install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm exec playwright install`, `pnpm --filter …
 * exec vite build`, `pnpm --filter '@object-ui/cli...' build`), which keeps the
 * documentation a summary of the gates rather than a transcript of the YAML.
 *
 * The hole that leaves, stated so nobody mistakes it for coverage: a gate written
 * as an inline shell block names no first-party command and is invisible here.
 * Gates in this repository land as a root `package.json` script or a
 * `scripts/*.mjs` file — both covered — and that is the only reason the narrower
 * rule is enough.
 *
 * Steps are read from `run:` values only, never from the surrounding YAML. Both
 * workflows carry comments that name their own gates — `ci.yml`'s `type-check`
 * block mentions `pnpm type-check`, `turbo run type-check` and `pnpm
 * check:i18n-drift`, and `lint.yml`'s step comments name every script it runs
 * plus two `pnpm check:*` aliases it deliberately does NOT use — so a scan of the
 * raw block would take all of them for steps and this pin would then be
 * describing its own comments.
 *
 * A `--self-test` invocation and the real one collapse to one entry: the rule is
 * about which gate the page must name, not how many times the YAML types it.

 * objectui#3451: the same drift as #3197/#3212, one table lower down and pointing
 * the dangerous way. The `## Core CI Workflow (ci.yml)` section opened with "Seven
 * jobs, all parallel" and its table's seventh row described a `dev-server` job —
 * "guards `apps/dev-server`'s `objectstack.config.ts` against fixture /
 * `@objectstack/spec` drift", running "Every run".
 *
 * The history matters, because the row was wrong in two different ways and only the
 * second is the one you would guess:
 *
 *   2026-05-24  `apps/dev-server` lands, and with it the `dev-server` job.
 *   2026-05-26  `apps/dev-server` is removed. The job stays. `--filter
 *               @object-ui/dev-server` now matches no package and exits 0 —
 *               green by vacuity, for the next 69 days.
 *   2026-08-03  #3253 (fixing #3212) rewrites this very table and *adds* the
 *               `dev-server` row, describing a fixture-drift guard that had not
 *               built anything since May. The row was false the day it was written.
 *   2026-08-04  #3325 deletes the vacuous job from `ci.yml`, leaving the row.
 *   2026-08-06  #3451.
 *
 * So this is not only "the YAML moved and the prose lagged". #3253 pinned the
 * *workflow* inventory in both directions and left the *job* table unpinned, and the
 * table drifted within a day. #3197's comment names the direction: understating a
 * gate is annoying, advertising a guardrail the CI does not have is worse than no
 * doc.
 *
 * The count and the table are pinned together because fixing either one alone fixes
 * a snapshot, not the drift. Add or remove a job in `ci.yml` without editing this
 * page and the first test below fails, naming the job in each direction.
 *
 * What this still cannot catch is the 2026-05-26 shape: a job that exists in YAML
 * and does nothing. No amount of doc-to-YAML pinning sees that — only reading what
 * the job runs does.

 * objectui#4170: the `## Merge Queue` section's other current-state claim — the
 * "Some contexts can never be required, structurally" bullet, which names four
 * workflows and, for each, quotes the live YAML property that makes it
 * unrequirable.
 *
 * All four were TRUE when this landed, so this pins prose that was not wrong; it
 * is here because of what happens next. objectui#4154 had just converged the
 * sibling paragraph one level up onto a pointer, for the reason that prose
 * nothing reads goes stale silently — and this bullet is that shape with an
 * expiry date already written into the YAML it describes: `live-e2e.yml`'s own
 * header says its `continue-on-error: true` comes off once the lane has run
 * clean long enough to trust. The day that lands, this page states that a lane
 * which now blocks merges can *never* block them, which is the direction #3197
 * and #3451 both name as the dangerous one — advertising or denying a guardrail
 * wrongly is worse than saying nothing, because people stop checking.
 *
 * The bullet is kept whole rather than replaced by a pointer (the choice that
 * fit #4154 and does not fit here): its four entries teach four *different*
 * structural reasons a context cannot be required — an inverse path filter, an
 * ordinary one, a job that cannot fail, and a trigger that only fires after the
 * merge. That is pedagogy, not an inventory, and a pointer would delete it.
 *
 * Every expectation below is READ OUT OF the workflow — never a second copy of
 * the value written here (the objectui#4150 derived-expectation pattern). The
 * page is then checked against what the YAML actually says, so a path list or a
 * trigger type cannot be changed in one place and stay green in the other.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated so it is not mistaken for more — this pins EXAMPLES TRUE, not a
 * CENSUS:
 *
 *   - Nothing here scans `.github/workflows/` for other structurally
 *     unrequirable workflows, and a fifth one arriving must NOT turn this red.
 *     The bullet says "Some contexts", and it is right to: it exists to teach
 *     the four shapes, not to enumerate their instances.
 *   - What IS checked in both directions is the page's own claims. A line added
 *     to that bullet needs an entry here, or it is unpinned prose again — this
 *     issue verbatim — and an entry here whose line has left the page fails too,
 *     so a claim cannot be quietly dropped while its pin reports green.
 *
 * THE `live-e2e.yml` RED IS EXPECTED, and it is not a bug to be worked around.
 * When `continue-on-error` comes off that job, `structuralBlocks` fails naming
 * `live-e2e.yml`. The fix is to DELETE that line from the bullet and its entry
 * from the map below — the lane has become requirable, so the page must stop
 * saying otherwise. Do not soften the line ("mostly informational"), and do not
 * relax the check to keep it green: a page that hedges about whether a gate can
 * block you is the failure this file was opened for.
 *
 * `performance-budget.yml`'s line quotes no value (it says "an ordinary path
 * filter" and names no globs), so only the existence of the property is pinned
 * there. The asymmetry is deliberate: `quotes` derives from the YAML, and a
 * claim that quotes nothing has nothing to derive.
 *
 * The small YAML-block helpers below are local copies of the ones in
 * `merge-queue-reporting.test.ts`. Data is never copied in this repository; a

/**
 * objectui#7689 — the page's live-e2e section states a pin rule that nothing read.
 *
 * `content/docs/guide/ci-cd-pipeline.md` says the backend pins "must match the
 * `@objectstack/spec` version in `pnpm-lock.yaml` — bump both in the same PR, or the
 * run proves nothing", and `e2e/live/ci/backend.env` repeats the same MUST in its own
 * header. Both were true statements about what a reader should do and false statements
 * about what CI checked: `git grep -l backend.env scripts/ .github/ e2e/` reached only
 * the workflow that caches on its hash and the script that sources it. Nothing compared
 * the two numbers, so the pin sat at `17.0.0-rc.2` against a lockfile resolving `17.2.0`
 * for two minor versions while `Live E2E (informational)` reported green.
 *
 * That is the shape this file exists for, and the worst instance of it yet. The size
 * regime in #3197 advertised a guardrail CI did not have; here the lane's OWN contract
 * says a mismatched pair "proves nothing", so every green run it produced over those two
 * minors was a check whose documentation declared it meaningless. A stale constant is a
 * chore; a green light its own spec disclaims is worse than a red one.
 *
 * ## What this asserts, and the one half it deliberately does not
 *
 * ASSERTED: `OBJECTSTACK_VERSION` equals the `@objectstack/spec` version the lockfile
 * resolves, read two independent ways (the resolution keys under `packages:`/`snapshots:`
 * and the `version:` line of every workspace importer) whose union must hold exactly one
 * value. Two readings rather than one because "the resolved version" is only a
 * well-formed question while the tree agrees with itself: a lockfile carrying two
 * `@objectstack/spec` versions has no single number for the pin to match, and naming that
 * is more useful than picking one of them and comparing to it.
 *
 * ALSO ASSERTED, since objectui#7964: that the file's other pin is GONE. `OBJECTSTACK_REF`
 * used to be a second, hand-moved sha here, carrying a MUST — "always the commit the
 * `@objectstack/cli@${OBJECTSTACK_VERSION}` release tag points at" — that nothing could
 * check, because reading that tag needs the objectstack repository over the network and
 * this unit lane has not got it. That was a true statement about what a reader should do
 * and, again, an unenforceable one: the same shape #7689 is about, one file down.
 *
 * The fix was not another check. It was to delete the second value: `start-backend.sh`
 * now RESOLVES the commit at boot from the release tag named by `OBJECTSTACK_VERSION`
 * (`git ls-remote --tags`, peeled `^{}` sha preferred) and refuses to start when the tag
 * does not resolve to a 40-character sha. The lane that consumes the commit is the lane
 * that can reach the repository, and it always could. So the pair the header describes
 * cannot disagree by construction, and there is nothing left here to hand-move.
 *
 * What this file pins about that half is therefore the ABSENCE and the DERIVATION, by
 * content: no `OBJECTSTACK_REF=` key in backend.env, and the resolution + refusal still in
 * start-backend.sh. Either one alone would be vacuous — an absent key is fine only while
 * something derives the value, and a derivation is only load-bearing while no pin
 * overrides it.
 *
 * ## Anti-vacuity
 *
 * Each half is floored. The doc sentence is required to still be on the page, because
 * this whole block is the enforcement of that sentence and a page that stopped making the
 * claim should retire the pin deliberately rather than leave it running on prose nobody
 * reads. The lockfile scan is required to have matched something, so a lockfile format
 * change turns this red instead of green-with-an-empty-set — the failure mode #3451 keeps
 * teaching this page.

 * section were FOUR spellings of one claim — "failures surface as an uploaded Playwright
 * report" — and all four were decided by a single line somewhere else entirely:
 * `playwright.live.config.ts`'s `reporter`. That line reads `[['list']]`; the `list` reporter
 * writes to stdout and nothing in that config writes `playwright-report/`, so the promised
 * report was unreachable in EVERY outcome. Measured on a passing run and on a failing run:
 * absent both times, with an `html` reporter as the control that proves the directory is
 * observable when a reporter actually writes it.
 *
 * Nothing read those four sites against the config, which is exactly how they drifted, and
 * the cost was not cosmetic: objectui#8084's acceptance criterion was written as "a
 * `playwright-report/` appears in the uploaded artifact", so a correct fix could never have
 * satisfied its stated test. An acceptance criterion nobody can pass is the same hazard as a
 * check nobody can fail, pointed the other way.

/**
 * objectui#8084 defect ② — the lane's RUN conclusion asserted the negation of its JOB's.
 *
 * Measured on the 2026-09-06 nightly, while `live-e2e.yml`'s job carried
 * `continue-on-error: true`:
 *
 *     step 7 `Start ObjectStack backend`    failure
 *     job 101442890465                      failure
 *     check run `Live E2E (informational)`  failure
 *     check suite 92170955546               success
 *     workflow run 34017174769              success
 *
 * The flag moved neither the job nor its check run — the two readings a merge gate and a
 * reviewer consult — and inverted only the aggregate. This is worse than an omission: any
 * monitor, digest or agent reading run-level conclusions was told `success` while the live
 * E2E had not executed at all, which is why the backend outage carded as that issue's defect
 * ① ran a full day unseen. An outage detector that reports the negation of what it detects.
 *
 * ⛔ The repair is NOT to make the lane blocking, and this pin does not ask for that: what
 * makes the lane non-blocking is that it is not in the required-check set and declares no
 * `merge_group` trigger, neither of which `continue-on-error` had anything to do with. The
 * two are compatible; conflating them is the trap the card names.
 *
 * ## Why this is scoped to the job's OWN keys, and why the control below is not optional
 *
 * The entry this replaces in STRUCTURAL_BLOCKS asked `/^\s*continue-on-error:\s*true\s*$/m`
 * of the whole job block and promised, in writing, to go red the day the flag came off the
 * job. It could not: objectui#7048 later split both caches into bounded `save` STEPS that
 * each carry `continue-on-error: true` at step level, and `\s*` matches their indentation
 * just as happily. Two step-level flags kept that assertion green for a property that no
 * longer existed — an assertion that cannot fail, which is this card's own defect one level
 * down.
 *
 * So the matcher here is anchored to four spaces, the indentation of a job's own keys, and
 * the discrimination is EXERCISED rather than assumed: the control asserts that step-level
 * flags really are present in this job and really are not matched. If those saves are ever

/**
 * objectui#8420: the same pairing again, on the two sections the card measured by
 * hand — and the alias question that had to be settled before either pin could be
 * pointed at them.
 *
 * ## The two instances
 *
 * `vi-mock-specifiers.yml` runs TWO gates in one job: `check-vi-mock-specifiers.mjs`
 * and `check-vi-mock-inherit.mjs`. The section named only the first, and the second
 * is a blocking step of a required context (`dependabot-merge-gate.mjs` classifies
 * `Inert vi.mock Specifier Check`) — so a contributor reading that section to learn
 * what CI does to their pull request did not know a gate that can stop it exists.
 * Measured on `256c709e2`, searching the whole page for both spellings in one
 * command: `check-vi-mock-inherit` returned 0 and `check-vi-mock-specifiers`
 * returned 3, which is what makes the zero a reading rather than a failed probe.
 *
 * `shadcn-check.yml`'s section described the job in three prose bullets and named
 * none of the three first-party commands it runs.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Why this is two pins and not a loop over the page
 *
 * The card measured the naive extension — pair every `## Heading (some.yml)`
 * section against every job in that workflow — and it flags 24 of the 34 sections,
 * MOST of which are not defects: a section that names a neighbouring gate for
 * contrast (and says so), an illustrative `scripts/some-gate.mjs` placeholder
 * inside a code block, and sections that name a `pnpm check:*` alias where the
 * workflow invokes `node scripts/…` directly. A gate that cries wolf gets switched
 * off rather than fixed — this repository's own words, in
 * `check-unreferenced-sources`. So sections join this rule one at a time, each
 * after somebody has decided what that section's documentation surface IS.
 *
 * ## ⭐ The alias decision, and its blast radius
 *
 * Settled here for these two units only: **an alias whose root `package.json`
 * definition is exactly `node scripts/<file>` names the same gate as invoking that
 * file directly.** `pnpm check:vi-mock-specifiers` IS
 * `node scripts/check-vi-mock-specifiers.mjs` — same script, same population, same
 * verdict — and the vi.mock section names the alias because that is how a
 * contributor runs it locally. Without this, `undocumentedCommands` reads the two
 * spellings as two commands and reports the page's own "run it locally" line as a
 * phantom gate: cry wolf, on the first section this rule was pointed at.
 *
 * What the decision deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 *   - **It does not merge an alias that carries arguments.** `pnpm shadcn:check` is
 *     `node scripts/shadcn-sync.js --check` and `pnpm shadcn:update` is the same
 *     script with `--update`; collapsing both onto the script would let the page
 *     document one and the workflow run the other. An alias with arguments selects
 *     a MODE, and is only ever the same command as itself.
 *   - **It does not reach the other 32 sections, nor the `ci.yml` table or the
 *     `lint.yml` section above.** Those two were settled without it and are pinned
 *     by the unmodified module-scope rule; re-pointing them is a separate card, not
 *     a silent side effect of this one.
 *   - **It does not make the pre-install distinction disappear.** Several workflows
 *     invoke `node scripts/…` rather than the alias because the step runs BEFORE
 *     `pnpm install`, which is real and deliberate. That is a fact about step
 *     PLACEMENT; this rule measures which gates a job runs, and on that question
 *     the two spellings are one gate.

/**
 * objectui#8420, second instance set: the four sections a full census of this page
 * measured as real command-parity defects.
 *
 * ## Why four, and why not a loop over the page
 *
 * The card warned that the naive extension — pair every `## Heading (some.yml)`
 * section against every job in that workflow — flags most of the page and that most
 * of those flags are not defects. It does: 15 of the 36 workflow sections disagree
 * with their workflow under the settled alias rule. The census that preceded these
 * pins accounted for all 36 individually, and the disagreements split like this:
 *
 *   - **4 already pinned** — `ci.yml`, `lint.yml`, `vi-mock-specifiers.yml`,
 *     `shadcn-check.yml`.
 *   - **11 legitimate exceptions** — a section naming a neighbouring gate for
 *     contrast and saying so, an illustrative `scripts/some-gate.mjs` placeholder,
 *     a file named in an enumeration of the workflow's *trigger paths*, an alias
 *     that carries an argument and therefore selects a MODE (`pnpm governed` is
 *     `node scripts/check-governed-queue-guard.mjs --test`).
 *   - **4 with no first-party command on either side** — the job's work is done by
 *     a third-party action.
 *   - **13 that agree today** and are held that way by nothing.
 *   - **4 true defects** — the ones pinned below.
 *
 * So this is still four named sections, not a sweep. The other 32 are accounted for
 * by that census, ⛔ not by silence, and joining any of them to this rule is still a
 * decision about what that section's documentation surface IS.
 *
 * ## What each of the four was hiding
 *
 * `## Performance Budget` was the one that mattered, and it hid two gates rather
 * than one:
 *
 *   - `pnpm check:sdui-registration-pins` runs in a step of its own with no
 *     `continue-on-error`, and the section contained the strings `sdui`, `SDUI` and
 *     `registration` **zero** times. `"sideEffects": false` is statically coherent
 *     and still drops live SDUI widget registrations out of the build entirely
 *     (objectui#6535) — a gate a contributor could be stopped by and could not find.
 *   - `pnpm check:eager-closure` is the **second half of the budget step itself**,
 *     and the section's rule read *"Exactly one bundle-size number in this
 *     repository is enforced"*. Two are. See the enforcement test below for the exit
 *     path that says so.
 *
 * The other three were each a build the section describes in prose and does not
 * name: `turbo run build` in `skill-examples.yml` and `spec-range-floors.yml`,
 * `pnpm build` in `changeset-release.yml`'s release job.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The blind spot this set makes explicit
 *
 * `commandParity` reads `run:` steps and nothing else. A command a job really runs
 * through an **action input** is invisible to it, and `changeset-release.yml` runs
 * two that way through `changesets/action@v1`'s `publish:`. Reading those as
 * phantoms and deleting them from the page would be the instrument editing the
 * truth to match itself. They are declared below instead, with the reason, and the
 * declaration is asserted in BOTH directions so it cannot rot into an allowlist.

/**
 * objectui#8629: three live populations on this page were written down as literals
 * with nothing deriving them — the docs-page population the eager-closure section
 * credits to the route, the file population the shell-escape section credits to the
 * `skills` scan root, and the sweeper's page window, copied out of a source
 * constant. The first was already false when the card was filed. ⛔ Correcting the
 * numerals would have been the same card again in a month, which is the ruling
 * objectui#7448, objectui#7825 and objectui#7965 have each recorded after doing
 * exactly that; the page now names the tree each population is derived from and the
 * run that prints it, and these pins refuse a count written back.
 *
 * ## ⭐ The unit, which is the transferable half
 *
 * Both defective sentences WRAP: the numeral sat at the end of one line and its noun
 * at the start of the next. A per-line reader returns **zero** for each of them on a
 * file where they are plainly present — measured, not theorised, twice: by the seat
 * that verified this card and by objectui#8606 from the workflow-header side. So
 * every assertion below judges JOINED text, and the first test proves the unit is
 * really joined by finding a phrase this page carries that no single line contains.
 *
 * ## Why these are section-scoped and not page-wide
 *
 * ⛔ A page-wide ban on "N files" would flag the sentences that are CORRECT — the
 * skills-paths measurement and the test-file cell each state the commit they were
 * measured on, the changeset-overwrite figure states its window. Those declare what
 * they measured, which is the remedy, not the defect; rewriting them into live
 * figures would create the defect. The scope of each pin is therefore the one
 * section whose sentence was stating a population it did not derive.
 *
 * ⚠️ Known gap, recorded rather than papered over: the family's noun pattern needs
 * whitespace before the noun, so a hyphenated population ("a 556-page docs build",
 * which this page also carries and which is mirrored in the gate's own header) is
 * invisible to it. That instance is filed as objectui#9004; widening the noun
 * pattern is not a change this pin may make alone, because the same pattern is
 * shared with the other carriers of the family.
