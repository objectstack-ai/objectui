/**
 * Shared section-field normalizer for every `object-form` arm that takes
 * sections: Tabbed / Wizard / Split / Drawer / Modal, and — since
 * objectui#10475, through `SectionFieldsContext.pool` — the default arm
 * (`SimpleObjectForm`).
 *
 * A form-view section lists its fields in one of three shapes:
 *
 *   1. a plain string — the field name:                 `'account_number'`
 *   2. a spec FormFieldSchema object (canonical) —      `{ field: 'name', required: true, colSpan: 2 }`
 *   3. an already-built runtime FormField object —       `{ name: 'x', type: 'text', ... }`
 *
 * Shape (2) is what `@objectstack/spec` emits — see FormFieldSchema, where the
 * key is `field`, NOT `name`. The variants used to read `fieldDef.name` and push
 * the raw object straight through, so a spec entry reached react-hook-form with
 * `name === undefined` and crashed the whole form on `name.split('.')`. This
 * helper normalizes all three shapes into a runtime FormField with a real
 * `name`, merging object-schema metadata (type/options/validation) with the
 * spec-level overrides.
 *
 * Also hosts the two top-level counterparts of this file's own
 * `warnOnMixedVocabulary`, both about the SAME vocabulary shape (2) documents,
 * and all three kept here so they do not drift in voice:
 *
 *   - `warnUnresolvedTopLevelField` (objectui#8738 route 1) — a top-level
 *     `fields` member that resolves to no field name, shared by
 *     `ObjectForm.tsx`'s `SimpleObjectForm` and `flatFields.ts`'s
 *     `buildFlatFields`, neither of which is a sectioned variant.
 *   - `warnSectionMemberExcludedByFields` (objectui#9884) — a `sections[].fields`
 *     member the object really declares, dropped because the form's top-level
 *     `fields` does not list it. The two keys INTERSECT; this is the warning
 *     that makes the loser audible.

 * The THIRD member of this file's warning family (objectui#9884), and the one

 * Top-level `fields` and `sections` are NOT layers — they INTERSECT.
 * `SimpleObjectForm` builds the parent field pool from `schema.fields` first
 * (`fieldsToShow` in `ObjectForm.tsx`), and each section then resolves its own
 * members against THAT pool. So a member a section names, that the object
 * really declares, is dropped for the single reason that the form's top-level
 * `fields` does not list it — and when it is that section's last surviving
 * member the section is dropped whole, heading and all.
 *
 * ⛔ This function only WARNS, for the same reason `warnUnresolvedTopLevelField`
 * above only warns: resolving the member here — widening the pool to the union
 * of `fields` and every section's members — would change what a landed schema
 * renders, submits and prefills, because that pool is also what feeds create
 * defaults, the `initialValues` merge and the submitted value set. The
 * intersection is the behaviour three of this package's four `fields`
 * registrations declare and `objectFormFieldsMembers-8071` pins; what was
 * wrong was `object-master-detail-form`'s registration claiming `fields` is
 * "Ignored when `sections` is given", and that sentence is what objectui#9884
 * corrected. The remaining defect was the SILENCE, and this is it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Deliberately NOT fired for a member the object never declares at all —
 * a typo, or a detail-collection column borrowed into the parent's vocabulary.
 * That member resolves to nothing whether or not `fields` is authored, so it
 * is a different silence with a different remedy; it is pinned as behaviour by
 * `objectFormSectionMembers-8071` row 2 and `masterDetailSectionMembers-8071`
 * row 2, and widening this warning to cover it would make those two rows fire
 * it on every run while saying nothing this card measured.
