/**
 * One concept, one key: the console `<PageHeader>`'s secondary line is
 * `subtitle` (objectui#4761).
 *
 * WHAT DIVERGED. This repo has two components named `PageHeader`.
 * `@object-ui/layout`'s is the renderer for the authored `page:header` /
 * `page-header` node and converged on `subtitle` in objectui#3789, because
 * `subtitle` is the key `@objectstack/spec/ui`'s `PageHeaderProps` declares.
 * This one — the console's own title row, used by `ObjectView` and
 * `ObjectDataPage` — spelled the very same concept `description` and had no
 * `subtitle` at all. Two dialects for one idea, one package apart, which is the
 * objectstack#4115 shape moved up a layer. Nothing rendered wrong on either
 * side; the defect was the divergence itself, and an author (especially an AI
 * one) reading one component to learn the other was being taught the wrong key.
 *
 * WHY A PLAIN RENAME AND NOT AN ALIAS. The alias route the layout side needed
 * was not needed here: this component is not part of `@object-ui/app-shell`'s
 * published API. Measured, not assumed — `src/index.ts` names 226 exports and
 * `PageHeader` is not among them (the package has no `export *` to propagate it
 * silently), and the `exports` map declares exactly `.` and `./styles.css`, so
 * Node refuses every deep subpath that could reach it with
 * `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. With no supported import path there was
 * nothing to keep compatible, and a renderer-side alias would have been exactly
 * the second dialect AGENTS.md #0.1 forbids.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE PINS. Both directions of the convergence, so the next agent
 * finds an answer instead of re-opening the drift:
 *   1. `subtitle` renders, as the secondary line beneath the title, inside the
 *      header — asserted on the DOM a user gets, not on the props object.
 *   2. `description` is an ordinary unknown prop: rejected by the compiler and
 *      drawing nothing at runtime.
 *   3. This component and `@object-ui/layout`'s agree on the key, at compile
 *      time — the assertion that actually goes red if either side drifts again.
