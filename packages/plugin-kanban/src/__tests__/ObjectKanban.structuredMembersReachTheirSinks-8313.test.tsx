 * objectui#8313 — the MEMBER shape of `object-kanban`'s four array/object-armed
 * keys, each measured AT ITS OWN SINK.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `structuredKeysAreDeclaredAndHonoured-8313.test.ts` next door is the
 * DECLARATION half: it asserts `data`, `cardFields`, `grouping` and
 * `conditionalFormatting` are discoverable — the html tier accepts them, both
 * registrations publish them, and `ComponentPropsMap` does not refuse them by
 * name. It says nothing about what is INSIDE any of the four, and it cannot:
 * its spec row is a KEY verdict.
 *
 * Since objectui#8212 an array/object-armed declaration owes a member claim as
 * well, and the criterion objectui#8068 set for one is that some file must
 * constrain the member shape the RENDERER READS, so that a registration
 * declaring `array` while the code reads members as something else goes red.
 * This is that file, registered as the `MEMBER_PINS` entry of all four keys.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ FOUR KEYS, FOUR DIFFERENT QUESTIONS — which is the whole point
 *
 * objectui#8223 had to correct a landed rider note that predicted `sort` would
 * be an identity pin; it could never have been, because `convertSortToQueryParams`
 * builds a new map. objectui#8269 found the sharper version: a resolver
 * answering WHICH FIELD and one answering WHICH COLUMN THE ROWS CARRY coincide
 * only when no alias is written. So each block below states which question it
 * answers, and none of the four is assumed to share a shape with another:
 *
 *   - `data` — read TWICE, with two different meanings. As a GATE it suppresses
 *     the board's own query; as a VALUE it is selected and then REBUILT into
 *     cards. ⛔ No identity claim is true of it, unlike the two `filter` pins.
 *     ⚠️ And the gate is DOUBLY guarded — see the `data` block below, which
 *     records the measurement rather than the guard this file first named.
 *   - `cardFields` — WHICH NAMES THE AUTHOR CHOSE, at the exported pure
 *     resolver. That is NOT the same question as which cells a card carries;
 *     the two are measured separately and shown to differ.
 *   - `grouping` — WHICH SINGLE NESTED POSITION is read, and under what
 *     precedence. One position (`fields[0].field`), one role (the fallback for
 *     `swimlaneField`), everything else inert.
 *   - `conditionalFormatting` — WHICH MEMBER DIALECTS are evaluated, and
 *     against what. Two dialects, per card, on the card's own record.
 *
 * ## The spec supplies none of it
 *
 * On the installed spec, `grouping` and `conditionalFormatting` are
 * `z.unknown().optional()` — exactly like `filter` and `sort` — so the contract
 * constrains the value not at all and cannot be the thing a member pin compares
 * against. `data` is `z.array(z.unknown())` and `cardFields` is
 * `z.array(z.string())`: those fix the CONTAINER kind and, for `cardFields`,
 * the member kind, but neither says anything about what the board does with a
 * member. For all four the read site is the whole of the member contract.
 *
 * ## Non-vacuity
 *
 * Every rendered row waits for real DOM before asserting, so "nothing rendered"
 * can never read as success — the discipline
 * `ObjectKanban.filterMembersReachTheWire-8176.test.tsx` states next door.
