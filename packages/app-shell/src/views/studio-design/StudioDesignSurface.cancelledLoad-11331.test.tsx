/**
 * objectui#11331 — a Studio pillar whose draft load is cancelled, with no load
 * to replace it, never leaves its canvas on "Loading…".
 *
 * A pillar's draft-load effect raises `loading` as a load starts, and only the
 * load's own `finally` lowered it, behind `if (!cancelled)`. So a load the
 * effect's cleanup cancelled never lowered it, and when the next run started
 * no load of its own the canvas kept the spinner for good. The rule now: the
 * cleanup of a run whose load has not settled takes back what that run's
 * start claimed.
 *
 * Every load under test waits on a gate the test opens, so the author's move
 * lands while the load is in flight on every run, not only on a slow machine.
 *
 *  - Interfaces: the auto-opened dashboard leaf is loading and the author opens
 *    a report leaf, which has no designer and loads nothing. Its canvas state
 *    shows at once and stays once the cancelled load lands. The control row
 *    clicks after the dashboard rendered.
 *  - Data: the open object is loading and the metadata client changes identity
 *    (`useMetadataClient` hands out a new one). The re-run used to skip the load
 *    as already claimed, though the cancelled load installed nothing. It loads
 *    again now. The guard's purpose is pinned beside it: a new client after the
 *    object loaded still reads nothing again, so an edit in progress is kept.
 *  - Automations: no row, because no component input reaches the case. Its
 *    effect returns early only on `!current`, and the pillar never sets `current`
 *    back to null once a flow is open, so a cancelled flow load always has a
 *    replacement. That is a reading of the source, and nothing here re-derives
 *    it. Its cleanup takes the same shape as the other two.
