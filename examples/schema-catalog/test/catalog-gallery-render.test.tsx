 * objectui#4616 — EVERY catalog entry is rendered the way the docs gallery
 * renders it, and no tile may show the registry's "Unknown component type"
 * panel or the renderer's error boundary.
 *
 * ## What this generalizes
 *
 * `plugin-dashboard-gallery-render.test.tsx` (objectui#4600) pinned one
 * category. It closed the blind spot for that category and left the rest of the
 * corpus in it: `smoke.test.tsx` has no `render(` call at all (its assertions
 * are structural — every entry is an object with a non-empty `type`) and
 * `plugin-dashboard-global-filters-spec.test.ts` (objectui#4356) validates
 * `globalFilters` against the spec without rendering. Both are satisfied by an
 * entry that renders nothing but a red error box.
 *
 * Measured on `origin/main` @ `e028dfcd8`, rendering all 423 entries against
 * the gallery's registration set as it stood after #4600 — 33 entries painted
 * the OBJUI-001 panel:
 *
 *   components-form-calendar 6 (calendar)   plugin-chatbot 3 (chatbot)
 *   plugin-editor 3 (code-editor)           plugin-gantt 3 (object-gantt)
 *   plugin-map 3 (object-map)               plugin-markdown 3 (markdown)
 *   plugin-timeline 3 (timeline)            plugin-calendar 2 (calendar-view)
 *   plugin-kanban 2 (kanban)                components-complex-filter-ui 1
 *   components-complex-sort-ui 1            components-complex-view-switcher 1
 *   components-disclosure-toggle-group 1    core-schema-renderer 1
 *
 * That is the red this file was written against. `apps/site/app/components/
 * registerCatalogBlocks.ts` loads the nine further packages that census
 * resolved to — further packages have joined that list since, none of them
 * from this census (see the host file's own header) — which takes 31 of those
 * 33 tiles from the panel to a drawn
 * component. What registration cannot reach is named — never skipped silently —
 * in the tables below. Four classes were defects in the entries, one issue each:
 *
 *   objectui#4624  1 entry  names root type "single", which nothing registers
 *   objectui#4625  6 entries author the bare `calendar` keyword, which belongs
 *                          to plugin-calendar's data-bound ObjectCalendar
 *   objectui#4626  2 entries were filed as blank tiles, each authoring a key
 *                          its own renderer never reads — one of the two was
 *                          measured to be neither (see below)
 *   objectui#4627  2 entries author events in a fixed past month, outside the
 *                          window `calendar-view` paints around today
 *
 * All four are FIXED in the entries — the first three as of objectui#4624's
 * PR, #4627 as of its own — so the ten entries they covered carry the full
 * assertion set here and no longer appear in either table. What #4624 measured,
 * and corrects in this header:
 *
 *  - #4625's six now author `ui:calendar`, the namespaced key the primitive is
 *    registered under. Probed through this file's own render path before the
 *    rewrite: `type: 'ui:calendar'` resolves and paints the date-picker grid
 *    (115 elements), because `Registry.get(type)` looks the string up verbatim
 *    and `register()` stores the namespaced form as `ui:calendar`. The bare
 *    keyword still reaches `ObjectCalendar` — that is not a bug to route
 *    around, it is `skipFallback: true` working as designed.
 *  - #4626's `basic-tooltip` was a real blank tile: it authored its trigger
 *    under `children`, which the tooltip renderer never reads. Now `trigger`.
 *  - #4626's `basic-hover-card` was NOT blank and authored no unread key.
 *    Measured: the text renderer reads `schema.content || schema.value`
 *    (`packages/components/src/renderers/basic/text.tsx:35,40`), so the
 *    authored `value` WAS read and the tile drew the text node "Hover over
 *    me" — which `drewSomething` accepts, and which an element-only view of
 *    the DOM (the one the filing reports) cannot see. Its real defect was
 *    that a bare text node is not an element, so `HoverCardTrigger asChild`
 *    had nothing to attach to and the card could never open; the trigger is
 *    now a link-variant button, the shape the renderer's own `defaultProps`
 *    declare. Removing its exclusion turns nothing red — verified by removing
 *    it BEFORE touching the entry.
 *
 * DATASOURCE_REQUIRED stays asserted, for the reason #4625 first supplied:
 * registering a package is not the same as a tile drawing, and a pin naming
 * only OBJUI-001 would have reported those six as fixed. It is now a
 * regression guard — an entry sliding back to the bare `calendar` keyword
 * fails on that string rather than on the panel.
 *
 * Six further entries are not rendered here at all, for reasons that are limits
 * of the environment rather than defects in anything: `plugin-editor`'s three
 * mount Monaco and `plugin-map`'s three mount maplibre, which between them want
 * a CDN loader script, WebGL2, and a live third-party tile host. The exclusion
 * table says why for each; what stays pinned for both buckets is the thing
 * objectui#4616 actually changed — that their types resolve — asserted in the
 * control case below.
 *
 * ## Why the module-scope package imports
 *
 * `ComponentRegistry` only knows a type once the package owning it has loaded,
 * so this file mirrors exactly what the gallery host registers, in the same
 * order — several packages claim the same bare keyword (`chart`, `calendar`)
 * and the last registration wins, so a reordered mirror would not be a mirror.
 * The last case in this file reads the host and fails if the two lists drift.
 *
 * ## What is asserted, per entry
 *
 * None of the three diagnostics — all three, for every entry: there are no
 * per-entry diagnostic exemptions left — and, the non-vacuity half, since an
 * entry that renders nothing at all trivially satisfies all three, the tile
 * actually produced DOM or text of its own. That control is not decoration: it
 * is what found objectui#4626's blank tooltip tile, which no red-tile sweep can
 * see. Note what it deliberately does NOT claim: text alone satisfies it, so a
 * tile drawing a bare text node passes — correctly, since `components-basic-
 * text/*` are exactly that. `basic-hover-card` is the case that proves the
 * distinction matters in both directions (see the header). For
 * the categories objectui#4616 newly registered, a stronger positive control on
 * top: the titles the entry itself authors are on screen
 * (`AUTHORED_TEXT_EXEMPT` records any that cannot be asserted that way, with
 * the reason — it is empty as of objectui#4627, and every entry in those
 * categories carries the control).
 *
 * The diagnostic strings are COPIED as literals rather than imported from the
 * packages' internals, for the reason objectui#4600 gave: they are
 * user-visible contract for this pin, and a reworded panel should turn it red
 * for review rather than silently follow along.
 *
 * `role="alert"` is deliberately NOT asserted category-wide the way #4600
 * asserts it for dashboards. Measured: `components-data-display-alert`'s two
 * entries render `role="alert"` because that is what an Alert IS — the
 * assertion is correct for a dashboard tile and wrong for the corpus.

 * objectui#7307 — this file's `/api/v1/security/explain` escape, served here.
 *
 * Nothing below asks for a security verdict, yet every run opened a REAL TCP
 * connection to `http://localhost:3000`. Traced with a stack probe on the
 * network-escape guard's attribution point:
 *
 *   the grid-bearing tiles (`object-grid`, and `object-view` around it)
 *     -> ObjectGrid             packages/plugin-grid/src/ObjectGrid.tsx:1407
 *       -> useRecordCrudVerdicts  packages/plugin-grid/src/hooks/useRecordCrudVerdicts.ts:199
 *         -> `const doFetch = apiFetch ?? fetch`      <- the escape
 *           POST /api/v1/security/explain  (batched, `recordIds` per page)
 *
 * The hook reads the host's AUTHENTICATED `apiFetch` off
 * `SchemaRendererContext` and, with no host supplying one, degrades to the
 * GLOBAL `fetch` by design — a standalone embed must keep rendering rather than
 * crash. Under happy-dom that global is a real HTTP client and the document URL
 * defaults to `http://localhost:3000`, so the relative path resolved to a live
 * request. The gallery harness below supplies a `dataSource` on `SchemaRendererContext` but no `apiFetch`, so the fallback is taken. The read is best-effort (a network or parse failure leaves the verdict map empty — fail open), which is why the sweep stayed green while 18 requests per run always failed.
 *
 * Answered from a RECORDING double — the shape objectui#5225 settled on and
 * `packages/plugin-report/src/__tests__/DatasetReportRenderer.test.tsx`
 * carries. Deliberately NOT a blanket network stub: it records every URL it is
 * handed and `afterEach` fails on any URL that is not the explain route, so an
 * escape to somewhere else reds here instead of vanishing into that `catch`.
 *
 * What it answers, and why that changes no assertion here: the permissive
 * verdict, in the two response shapes the two hooks read (ADR-0090 D6 /
 * ADR-0095 C2) — `{ record: { visible } }` for a single `recordId`,
 * `{ records: [{ recordId, visible }] }` for a batched `recordIds`.
 * `useRecordEditable` initialises `allowed` to `true` and its failure path
 * leaves it there, and the ONLY consumer of the batched lookup is
 * `resolveRowRecordCrudAffordance`, whose rule is `recordVerdict !== false` —
 * so `true` and the absent verdict the failing request produced are the same
 * value at every read site. This file asserts that each tile drew something other than a diagnostic panel; no tile's DOM is derived from the verdict.

 * EVERY `plugin-*` CATEGORY'S ENTRIES ACTUALLY USE THEIR PLUGIN
 * (objectui#5113 for `plugin-view`, objectui#5856 for `plugin-grid`,
 * objectui#6024 for the generalization to all thirteen).
 *
 * The sweep above answers "does every tile draw". It cannot answer the question
 * objectui#5113 was filed on: whether an example mounted under a PLUGIN's docs
 * page exercises that plugin. Two categories failed it in exactly the same way,
 * one card apart. `plugin-view`'s three entries used to be hand-built static
 * card layouts — `card` / `flex` / `text` / `badge`, no `object-view` node
 * anywhere — sitting on `content/docs/plugins/plugin-view.mdx` under an
 * "Interactive Examples" heading and inside a `PluginLoader plugins={['view']}`
 * wrapper none of them used. `plugin-grid`'s two were the same defect on
 * `content/docs/plugins/plugin-grid.mdx`. Every check in the repo was green on
 * all five: the types they named ARE registered (`check-doc-component-types`
 * asks only that), and the tiles DID draw (the sweep above asks only that).
 * Neither gate can see this defect, which is why this one exists.
 *
 * ## The two halves, and which entries carry which
 *
 * The card that generalized this named the hazard it had to avoid, and it is
 * the reason the classification below is COUNTED rather than implied: a pin
 * turned on for thirteen categories that silently applies only its cheap half
 * to eleven of them is WORSE than the honest two-category pin it replaced —
 * the coverage number goes up, the assurance goes down, and the number is what
 * gets quoted. So every entry's tier is derived, printed by
 * `it('states its own coverage split…')`, and pinned there as a literal that a
 * new category or a re-tiered entry turns red.
 *
 *  1. STRUCTURE (every entry) — the entry authors a node whose `type` is in the
 *     set its OWN package registers.
 *  2. MOUNT (every entry) — that node sits where the renderer actually paints.
 *     Measured by substitution: replace every own-type node with an inert probe
 *     and re-render; the probe's marker has to reach the DOM. This is the half
 *     that generalizes objectui#5113's RENDER assertion, and it is the answer
 *     to the specific hole in STRUCTURE — a STRAY node. A `type` that is not a
 *     node at all (a field's `type: 'select'`, a validation rule's
 *     discriminant), a node under a branch the parent never renders, or one
 *     behind a satisfied `hidden` expression all satisfy STRUCTURE and all fail
 *     MOUNT.
 *  3. DATA PROVENANCE (only entries that bind to an object the gallery fixture
 *     serves) — the tile shows a record that exists ONLY in the gallery's data
 *     source, so the rows on screen came through the registered renderer →
 *     `dataSource.find`, not out of the entry's own JSON. This is
 *     objectui#5113's original second fact, unweakened.
 *
 * ## What "shows a record" means, after objectui#6167
 *
 * The provenance token is looked for in the tile's TEXT **and** in the values
 * of its form CONTROLS, because those are two different places the same fact
 * lands. A grid puts a row into text; a form puts the record into
 * `input.value`, which `textContent` cannot see. Measured on the `plugin-form`
 * entries this card added: `Alice Johnson` arrives as the value of
 * `input[name]`, while the whole tile's text reads
 * `NameEmailDepartmentCancelSave changes`. A text-only reading would have
 * called a correctly bound form unbound — the blind-instrument failure, on the
 * very half that does the work.
 *
 * The widening is a SUPERSET of the old reading, so it cannot turn a red entry
 * green by relaxing anything; and `it('the provenance instrument still fails
 * on a surface with no record behind it')` below is the control that it still
 * discriminates — the same renderer in `create` mode paints the same controls
 * with nothing in them, and fails.
 *
 * (3) is the strongest of the three and it does NOT generalize, for a reason
 * that is a property of the entries rather than a gap in this file: the other
 * eleven categories author their data INLINE (`data`, `staticData`, `messages`,
 * `columns`, `content`), so there is no record that could only have come from
 * the fixture. Measured, entry by entry, on this card's merge-base: exactly the
 * five `plugin-view` / `plugin-grid` entries author `objectName` at all. Rather
 * than declare that in a table, `DATA_BOUND` is derived from each entry's own
 * JSON against the fixture's own object names — a category that becomes
 * object-bound picks the half up with no edit here, and one that loses it moves
 * the printed split and turns the summary red.
 *
 * ## What MOUNT does and does not claim
 *
 * It claims the entry's own-plugin node occupies a painted position in the
 * tile. It does not claim the plugin's renderer produced any particular pixel:
 * that is what (3) claims where it applies. Two weaker formulations were built
 * and MEASURED before being rejected, both as "the live tile shows content the
 * probe-substituted tile does not":
 *
 *   - by TEXT: `plugin-charts` renders recharts into a container that happy-dom
 *     gives zero size, so two of its three tiles paint no text at all
 *     (`advanced-line-chart`, `simple-bar-chart` — 0 new tokens against the
 *     probe render). The assertion would be red on entries that are correct.
 *   - by ELEMENT COUNT: same two tiles measured 3 elements live against 3
 *     probe-substituted, i.e. no margin at all, and the `React.lazy` categories
 *     (`kanban`, `markdown`, `code-editor`) make the count depend on whether
 *     the dynamic import has landed.
 *
 * A discriminator that is red on correct entries gets the gate deleted, so the
 * honest claim is the one asserted, and the split says how far it goes.
 *
 * ## The map is DERIVED from the `register()` calls, never enumerated
 *
 * A hard-coded `category → type` table is the same enumeration the `register()`
 * calls already own, and it rots the first time a plugin renames a type. So
 * `CATEGORY_OWN_TYPES` comes out of `deriveRegistryKeys` — the same derivation
 * `scripts/check-doc-component-types.mjs` runs for its own universe and
 * `scripts/regenerate-known-schema-types.mjs` for its generated list — keyed by
 * the `packages/<dir>/…` site each key was registered from. Catalog category
 * and package directory are the same string (`plugin-view` ↔
 * `packages/plugin-view`), which is what makes the join a derivation rather
 * than a second table.
 *
 * That it is a derivation is not a claim to take on trust — the rot it exists
 * to prevent had ALREADY happened by the time it was written. The card that
 * asked for this carried a hand-written table reading `plugin-form  form`, and
 * measured against the register calls that is wrong: `form` is registered by
 * `packages/components/src/renderers/form/form.tsx`, not by
 * `@object-ui/plugin-form`, whose own keys are `object-form`,
 * `embeddable-form`, `form-analytics` and `object-master-detail-form`. The two
 * `plugin-form` entries were therefore the third instance of the #5113 defect,
 * and were ledgered in `OWN_PLUGIN_DEBT` below until objectui#6167 rewrote them
 * as real `object-form` nodes; the ledger is empty as of that card. An
 * enumerated table would have inherited that mistake and reported them green.
 *
 * ## Why the set, not a single type
 *
 * `plugin-charts` breaks one-type-per-category: its entries author `chart` AND
 * `bar-chart`, both registered by `packages/plugin-charts`. The value is a SET,
 * and the rule stays PER ENTRY — *every* entry authors a node whose type is in
 * the set its own package registers. Deliberately NOT "the category authors at
 * least one type this package registers", which one conforming entry satisfies
 * while every other entry in the category drifts.
 *
 * The types are asserted to be REGISTERED separately from the render, because a
 * type that resolves to nothing fails every case below with the OBJUI-001 panel
 * rather than with anything about the entries. That separation was written for
 * `object-grid`, which used to reach this registry ONLY because
 * `@object-ui/plugin-view` imports `ObjectGrid` from `@object-ui/plugin-grid` —
 * load-bearing and invisible. objectui#6025 made both `@object-ui/plugin-grid`
 * and `@object-ui/plugin-form` declared imports of the gallery host, so
 * resolution no longer rides on that component import. The transitive path
 * still exists and still works, which is precisely why "is it registered"
 * cannot judge whether the declaration is there — see
 * `objectui#6025 — the gallery DECLARES the packages its entries need` below.
 *
 * ## No environment exclusions, and that is a result rather than an oversight
 *
 * `plugin-editor` and `plugin-map` are in `EXCLUSIONS` above because Monaco
 * wants a CDN loader and maplibre wants WebGL2 and a live tile host. Neither
 * half here needs them to render: MOUNT replaces the own-type node with the
 * probe, so `code-editor` and `object-map` never mount, and DATA PROVENANCE
 * does not apply to either (no `objectName`). Both categories carry the same
 * assertions as every other non-object-bound category — the environment limit
 * costs them nothing in this pin.

/**
 * DECLARED, NOT TRANSITIVE (objectui#6025).
 *
 * ## Why this is not the same question as "is the type registered"
 *
 * `object-grid` resolved in this registry long before the host declared it, and
 * it still would if the declaration were deleted: `@object-ui/plugin-view`
 * imports `ObjectGrid` from `@object-ui/plugin-grid`
 * (`packages/plugin-view/src/ObjectView.tsx:37`), and importing that entry runs
 * its `register` calls. The same is true of `@object-ui/plugin-form` one line
 * below it. Measured on this card's merge-base, importing exactly the eleven
 * packages the host then carried: `object-grid`, `object-form`,
 * `plugin-form:object-form`, `embeddable-form`, `form-analytics`,
 * `object-master-detail-form`, `record:line_items`, `view:form` and
 * `import-wizard` ALL resolved.
 *
 * So `expect(ComponentRegistry.get('object-grid')).toBeTruthy()` — which this
 * file does assert, for its own reason, in every category's own case — passes
 * in the declared world and in the transitive one alike. For THIS question it
 * is a ghost: an assertion that cannot fail in either world.
 *
 * What is asserted here instead is the host's DECLARATION, and it is a real
 * judge because of the case it leans on: the parity case above ties
 * `HOST_PACKAGES` to the literal import list in `registerCatalogBlocks.ts`.
 * Remove the import from the host and parity reds; remove it from both and this
 * case reds. No transitive import can satisfy either, because neither reads the
 * registry at all.
 *
 * The rule is derived, not enumerated: every `plugin-*` CATEGORY that has
 * catalog entries names a package the gallery renders through, so the host must
 * load that package by name. A new plugin category with entries picks the
 * requirement up with no edit here.

 * ## The defect
 *
 * `ObjectForm` copies a field's options through verbatim — `formField.options =
 * field.options || []` (`packages/plugin-form/src/ObjectForm.tsx`) — so a
 * `select` field with no `options` renders the "No options available" empty
 * state. Measured through this file's own render path, an `object-form` over
 * `users` with no `fields` restriction:
 *
 *   before: "NameEmailRoleNo options availableDepartmentStatusNo options
 *            availableCancelUpdate"
 *   after:  "NameEmailRoleAdminAdminMemberViewerDepartmentStatusActiveActive
 *            InvitedSuspendedCancelUpdate"
 *
 * and the record's own `role` / `status` join the form's control values
 * (`["Alice Johnson","alice@example.com","Engineering"]` → `["Alice Johnson",
 * "alice@example.com","admin","Engineering","active"]`), so the two fields stop
 * being dropped on the way in.
 *
 * ## Why the grid and view tiles do NOT move with it
 *
 * Worth recording, because the expectation going in was that they would.
 * `ObjectGrid` SYNTHESISES options for an option-less select from the distinct
 * values in the loaded rows (`packages/plugin-grid/src/ObjectGrid.tsx` —
 * `fieldMeta.options = uniqueValues.map(v => ({ value: v, label:
 * humanizeLabel(String(v)) }))`), so `admin` already printed as "Admin".
 * Measured: the tile text of all seven `users`-bound entries is byte-identical
 * before and after this declaration. The grid has a fallback for the missing
 * declaration; the FORM path has none. That asymmetry is the whole card.
 *
 * ## Two directions, because a one-sided pin cannot see this drift
 *
 * The host declared these options in `4b0b12630` and this mirror did not
 * follow for 330 commits — with every case in this file green throughout. The
 * `select`-coverage case below catches a fixture that declares neither; the
 * parity case catches the two files declaring different things.

/**
 * objectui#6537 — the two `plugin-form` entries stop steering around the
 * fixture's `select` fields.
 *
 * ## What the entries were working around
 *
 * Both `plugin-form` entries authored a field list that omitted `role` and
 * `status` — the only two `select` fields the `users` fixture declares:
 * `object-form-record` listed `["name","email","department"]` and
 * `object-form-tabbed-sections` sectioned over `[name,email]` /
 * `[department,created_at]`. That was never an authoring choice. Until
 * objectui#6317 this mirror declared both fields with NO `options`, and
 * `ObjectForm` copies a field's options through verbatim (`formField.options =
 * field.options || []`), so a form over either one painted the "No options
 * available" empty state — on a docs page whose whole purpose is to show the
 * component working. The five `plugin-grid` / `plugin-view` entries over the
 * same object never steered around them, because `ObjectGrid` SYNTHESISES
 * options for an option-less select from the loaded rows. That asymmetry is
 * what #6317 measured, and it is why only the FORM entries carried a
 * workaround.
 *
 * #6317 declared the options in the host fixture's `users` schema and in this
 * mirror, so the constraint is gone and both entries carry the full field
 * surface again.
 *
 * Measured through this file's own render path, before and after this card:
 *
 *   object-form-record
 *     before "NameEmailDepartmentCancelSave changes"
 *     after  "NameEmailRoleAdminAdminMemberViewerDepartmentStatusActiveActive
 *             InvitedSuspendedCancelSave changes"
 *   object-form-tabbed-sections
 *     before "IdentityOrganisationNameEmailDepartmentCreatedCancelSave changes"
 *     after  "IdentityOrganisationAccessNameEmailDepartmentCreatedRoleAdmin
 *             AdminMemberViewerStatusActiveActiveInvitedSuspendedCancelSave
 *             changes"
 *
 * ("Admin" twice: the closed trigger shows the selected option's label, and
 * the option list carries it again.) The record's own values join the form's
 * controls with them — `["Alice Johnson","alice@example.com","Engineering"]`
 * becomes `["Alice Johnson","alice@example.com","admin","Engineering",
 * "active"]` — so the two fields stop being dropped on the way in.
 *
 * That the text MOVES is the point, and it is the half #6317 could not show:
 * the seven `users`-bound tiles were byte-identical across that card because
 * the grid synthesises what the declaration was missing. The form path has no
 * such fallback, so here the declaration is visible.
 *
 * The tabbed entry is measurable from its `identity` default tab because
 * `TabbedForm` keeps EVERY panel mounted inside one `<form>` (objectui#2959,
 * so a tab the user leaves keeps its values and one submit spans them all) —
 * the `Access` tab's controls are in the DOM without activating it.
 *
 * ## Why this is a pin and not just an edit
 *
 * The workaround is invisible in the entries themselves — a shorter `fields`
 * list reads as a deliberately trimmed demo, and every case in this file was
 * green the whole time it was there. Nothing would notice it coming back. So
 * the rule is stated positively and DERIVED from the fixture: every
 * `plugin-form` entry authors every `select` field the fixture declares, and
 * each of those fields puts its declared option labels on screen. A field that
 * becomes a `select`, or an option that is added, joins this pin with no edit
 * here; an entry that drops one turns it red.
 *
 * The render half is what makes it a measurement rather than a restatement of
 * the JSON: an authored field that renders the empty state satisfies the
 * authoring half and fails here.
