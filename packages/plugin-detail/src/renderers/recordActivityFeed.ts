 * `record:activity` — the pure half (objectui#3165).
 *
 * Two things live here, both testable without a DOM:
 *
 *  1. the `sys_activity` row → {@link FeedItem} map the block's self-fetch
 *     uses (the same map `RecordDetailView` applies to the rows it merges
 *     into its own feed — one shape for one table);
 *  2. {@link applyFeedConfig}, the filter/pagination pipeline that turns the
 *     block's DECLARED inputs (`types` / `showCompleted` / `unifiedTimeline`
 *     / `limit`) into observable behaviour.
 *
 * (2) exists as its own function on purpose. Before #3165 every one of those
 * inputs was a filter over a feed that was hard-coded empty — declared,
 * published to `sdui.manifest.json`, inert (objectstack#4413's shape). Making
 * them filter *whatever items the block has* — host-supplied or self-fetched —
 * is what stops the declaration from lying, and keeping the rule in one pure
 * function is what lets a test assert it directly rather than through a DOM.
 *
 * Enum membership is read from `@objectstack/spec` at runtime, never re-typed
 * here: a hand copy of a spec enum is how `FEED_TYPE_ICONS` lost six of the
 * thirteen feed types (objectstack#4115).

 * `sys_activity.type` → `FeedItem.type`.
 *
 * Meant to be one reading with the map `RecordDetailView` uses when it merges
 * `sys_activity` into the discussion feed. Two renderers that disagree about what a `created` row IS would put
 * the same record's history under two different icons depending on which block
 * an author reached for, so the richer `record_create` / `record_delete` /
 * `sharing` feed types the spec offers are NOT used here — adopting them is a
 * change to that shared map, not to this block.
 *
 * ⚠️ That copy is a hand-written literal in `app-shell`, not an import of this
 * one, and nothing fails when the two disagree — so the `scheduled` entry below
 * is currently present here and absent there. Tracked as objectui#5878; fixing
 * it means the second copy reading this export, which is a different package's
 * surface than this card's.
 *
 * `commented` / `mentioned` map to nothing because their content lives in
 * `sys_comment` (with reactions and threading attached) — a host that has both
 * merges the comment rows, and the block on its own has no comment write path
 * to pair them with. `login` / `logout` are account events, not record
 * activity.
 *
 * ## Two vocabularies, not one (objectui#5840)
 *
 * The keys were originally set-equal to plugin-audit's declared
 * `sys_activity.type` select options, and the test pinned exactly that. They no
 * longer are, because those options are **not** what the column stores:
 *
 *  - Every field on `sys_activity` is `readonly: true`, and objectql's
 *    `validateRecord` skips readonly fields on both the insert and the update
 *    branch. The eleven-value enum is therefore documentation, not a contract —
 *    an undeclared value is written silently (measured upstream by
 *    plugin-audit's own `sys-activity-type-vocabulary.test.ts`).
 *  - The platform itself forwards author-declared values into the column:
 *    ADR-0052 §5b.2 `activityMilestones[].type` is applied verbatim by
 *    plugin-audit's `audit-writers.ts` (`if (milestone.type) activityType =
 *    milestone.type`). That is how `completed` is produced, and it is a general
 *    door, not a special case.
 *
 * So `scheduled` is a value that is written, stored and queryable while being
 * undeclared upstream. Dropping it was not a decision this map made; it was the
 * absence of one. Its producer is HotCRM's `schedule_meeting` action
 * (`src/actions/global.actions.ts` — `type: EVENT_STATUS === 'held' ?
 * 'completed' : 'scheduled'`), registered for `crm_lead`, `crm_contact`,
 * `crm_account`, `crm_opportunity` and `crm_case`: the held branch reached the
 * timeline, the scheduled branch never did.
 *
 * `scheduled` → `event` is the semantic pairing and it is what makes the
 * declared `event` feed type reachable at all. Note the two branches of that
 * one producer now land at different DEFAULT visibility, which is the intended
 * reading: a held meeting is `completed` → `task`, hidden unless
 * `showCompleted`; a not-yet-held meeting is `scheduled` → `event`, shown,
 * because an upcoming meeting is the part of a timeline you still act on.
 *
 * ## The vocabulary is OPEN — ruled. Do NOT restore set-equality.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling of 2026-08-24 on objectstack#11507, **direction 4**:
 * `sys_activity.type` is AUTHOR-EXTENSIBLE. The declared select options are the
 * platform's BUILT-IN set, not the column's domain, and the two facts above are
 * why — readonly fields are never validated on write, and ADR-0052 §5b.2
 * forwards an author's `activityMilestones[].type` into the column verbatim.
 *
 * So the relation this table stands in is a SUPERSET, in one direction only:
 *
 *  - **map ⊇ built-ins** — every value the platform declares has an entry here,
 *    either a feed type or a deliberate `undefined` exclusion. A new built-in
 *    with no entry is a gap, and objectui#5969's pin turns red for it.
 *  - **NOT built-ins ⊇ map**, and NOT set-equality in either spelling. An
 *    author-extended value legitimately exists outside the declaration, so a
 *    pin that required the two sets to match would be false by construction.
 *
 * ⛔ A reader who finds no equality check here is looking at a DECISION, not an
 * omission: objectui#5840 removed the old set-equality pin on purpose, because
 * pinning to the closed declaration meant dropping stored rows, and
 * objectui#5969 replaced it with the two-directional pin under this ruling.
 *
 * (`scheduled` — the value #5840 was about — has since been declared upstream
 * by objectstack#11522, superseding objectstack#11424. That is precisely the
 * drift a hand-maintained equality pin cannot survive, and the reason the pin
 * is a superset assertion plus a fallback rather than a census of two groups.)
 *
 * A value outside this table is NO LONGER DROPPED: it renders through
 * {@link UNMAPPED_ACTIVITY_FEED_TYPE}. See {@link activityRowToFeedItem}.

 * cannot be derived here — app-shell depends on this package, not the other way

 * the census over the repository so the declaration cannot go stale silently.
 *
 * ## Census, and the pathspec it was taken over (objectui#5877)
 *
 * Every `.ts` / `.tsx` file in the repository that is not a test, at every top
 * level (`packages/`, `apps/`, `examples/`, `scripts/`, `e2e/`), narrowed to the
 * files that mention `FeedItem` at all — you cannot construct one without
 * naming the type — then read for `FeedItemType` literals. 1622 files scanned,
 * 13 mention `FeedItem`, one produces a kind off this map. A census is only as
 * wide as its pathspec, so the pathspec is stated rather than implied, and the
 * test above holds it.
 *
 * ⛔ NOT counted, deliberately: app-shell's `sharedUserFeeds.ts` /
 * `activityItemType.ts` read the same `sys_activity` rows but produce
 * `ActivityItemType` (`create` / `update` / `delete` / `comment` / `system`), a
 * DIFFERENT five-value vocabulary that is not a projection of this one in either
 * direction (objectui#6730 records why converging them costs rows). A row it
 * turns into an `ActivityItem` never becomes a `FeedItem`, so it produces
 * nothing for this feed. `ActivityEntry` in `@object-ui/types` is a third
 * vocabulary again, and has no producer at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ Also NOT counted, and the reason the diagnostic below names it: a HOST can
 * hand this block a feed of its own (`items` on the node, or a
 * `DiscussionContext` it mounts itself). Those items are produced outside this
 * repository, so no census taken here can bound their kinds.

 * filter token is skipped, never turned into a filter that can't match.
 *
 * ## Why that fallback needs a diagnostic (objectui#5891)
 *
 * `'all'` is the WIDEST of the four declared modes — `filterItems` in
 * `RecordActivityTimeline` narrows to ONE feed type for each of the other three
 * and returns the feed untouched for `'all'` — so every unrecognised value
 * lands on the one option that shows the author MORE than they asked for. A

 * the unfiltered stream, and the tell is a PLAUSIBLE result (a populated
 * timeline) rather than an empty one that gets investigated. That is the same
 * shape objectui#5841 removed from the sibling `types` sanitiser.
 *
 * The ruling on this card (triage, 2026-08-25) is that the defect is the
 * INVISIBILITY, not the fallback: `filterMode` seeds a control the user can
 * change, and there is no defensible narrower default to fall back to instead.
 * So nothing that renders changes here — what changes is that the fold is now
 * SAID OUT LOUD, once per distinct offending value (see {@link warnOnce}).
 *

 * is not a mistake, and a warning about a decision teaches authors to ignore
 * the channel. Only a value the author actually wrote is reported.
 *
 * The declared modes named in the message are read from `@objectstack/spec`'s
 * `FeedFilterMode` at runtime, never re-typed here — see the file header for

 *
 * A kind with no producer can be either of two very different things, and

 *
 *  - PRODUCED ({@link PRODUCED_FEED_TYPES}) — silent. Nothing to report.

 *    message stops there rather than calling it a gap. Whether somebody ruled
 *    against the kind and left no note is not knowable from here.
 *
 * ## What this diagnostic cannot see, stated in the message itself
 *
 * The census is over THIS repository's producers. A host that supplies the feed
 * (`items` on the node, or its own `DiscussionContext`) produces kinds no census
 * taken here can bound, so the message names that exception instead of
 * pretending the list is exhaustive.
 *
 * It is also repo-wide rather than per-path: `comment` counts as produced
 * because `RecordDetailView` produces it, even though a bare self-fetching block
 * with no host cannot (`commented` maps to `undefined` — a deliberate exclusion,
 * see {@link ACTIVITY_TYPE_TO_FEED_TYPE}). Reporting per-path would need the
 * feed's source, which this pure sanitiser does not have.

 * Deduped per distinct kind on its OWN channel — one authoring mistake is one
 * mistake however many times React re-runs the filter, and the unrecognised
 * channel must not silence this one (see {@link warnOnce}).

 * The ONE resolver for this block's row cap (objectui#10096).
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` declares the member a POSITIVE INTEGER
 * (`RecordActivityProps.limit`: `z.number().int().positive().default(20)`,
 * described there as "Number of items to load per page"), so a fractional cap
 * is not a spelling this renderer may interpret — it is a value the contract
 * REFUSES. A refused value is therefore dropped for this block's own default.
 *
 * ⛔ Not `Math.floor`, which is what this replaces: flooring REPAIRED an
 * authored `2.5` into a two-row window and handed it back as a result, so the
 * author got a silently different number than the one they wrote and no
 * channel named it. Refusing and defaulting is the answer the sibling
 * `record:history` gives through `normalizeHistoryLimit` (objectui#10093), and
 * the answer objectui#9925 landed at three further read points.
 *
 * `Number.isInteger` replaces `Number.isFinite` and nothing else: `NaN` and
 * both infinities were already refused by the old arm and are refused by this
 * one too. What the swap removes is the fractional ADMISSION.
 *
 * ⚠️ FAIL-SOFT and SILENT, both on purpose. Fail-soft because throwing would
 * take out a record page over one declaration. Silent because the sibling this
 * block is matched to refuses silently too — the three objectui#9925 read points
 * warn instead, so the family holds two answers on loudness and that question
 * is ruled on its own card (objectui#10097), not decided here by accident. The
 * silence is pinned.
 *
 * Coercion is kept exactly where the sibling keeps it: a numeric STRING still
 * resolves (`normalizeLimit('5')` is pinned to `5`). What narrows is the
 * admitted value SET, not how a node's value is read.
 *
 * ⭐ Shared with `record:chatter` / `record:discussion`, which resolve
 * `feed.limit` through this same function — `RecordChatterProps.feed` is
 * `RecordActivityProps`, so it is the same declared member and the same
 * refusal.
