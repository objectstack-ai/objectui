/**
 * `detail.showEmptyRelated` renders in the user's own language at EVERY plural
 * category — objectui#3863, the base-key fix, asserted through the real i18next.
 *
 * ## What was broken
 *
 * This was the repo's only pre-existing i18next plural family, and all ten packs
 * defined exactly two slots: `_one` and `_other`. i18next asks `Intl.PluralRules`
 * for the ONE suffix a language needs for that number and, finding no such slot,
 * walks `fallbackLng` to `en` — so the button rendered ENGLISH at:
 *
 *   - `ru` counts 2-4 (`few`) and 5-20, 25-30, … (`many`)
 *   - `ar` counts 0 (`zero`), 2 (`two`), 3-10 (`few`), 11-99 (`many`)
 *
 * The call site is the collapsed-empties button in
 * `packages/plugin-detail/src/renderers/record-reference-rail.tsx`, whose count is
 * `emptyTitles.length` — so 2 to 4 are the *most common* values it ever takes, and a
 * Russian user essentially always saw English.
 *
 * ## Why the fix is a base key and not `_few`/`_many`
 *
 * `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` requires the ten packs to hold IDENTICAL key sets,
 * so giving `ru` a `_few` would be "a key `en` lacks" and fails by design. The base
 * key (no suffix) is always in i18next's lookup chain, so every category a pack did
 * not enumerate lands on it — in that pack's language — while the key set stays
 * identical everywhere. Established by objectui#3546 slice six for `perm.facet.*`
 * (`perm-home-namespace-3546.test.tsx`, the template this file follows); that slice
 * filed this family rather than fixing it, and this is that debt.
 *
 * The rule itself ("a plural family must carry a base key") lives in
 * `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` — pack-intrinsic, so the NEXT plural family fails
 * at PR time without needing a call site to exist. This file pins the rendering.
 *
 * ## Why these assertions are the ones that discriminate
 *
 * `en` output is identical before and after (its categories are exactly `one`/`other`,
 * so it never reaches the base key), and so is `de`/`zh`/`ja`/`ko` output. Every
 * assertion that can tell the fix from its absence is a `ru` or `ar` one — the rest
 * prove reachability and prove the English wording did not move.
