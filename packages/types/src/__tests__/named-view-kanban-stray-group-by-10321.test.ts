 * objectui#10321 — a named view's stray `kanban.groupBy` is refused at the
 * object-view read door.
 *
 * ## ⭐ RE-PINNED at objectui#11073: the protocol's refusal, and no pointer
 *
 * Until `@objectstack/spec` 17.5.0 this door added objectui's pointer
 * (`custom` at `listViews.KEY.kanban.groupBy`, the `list-view` route's string)
 * beside the protocol's `unrecognized_keys`. 17.5.0 makes that refusal TERMINAL,
 * zod then skips even a `when`-guarded check, and the pointer
 * (`checkNamedViewKanbanStrayGroupBy`) was retired (seat ruling Q2 → A on
 * objectui#11073). The rows below pin what stands: the protocol refuses the
 * key by name at `listViews.KEY.kanban`, and objectui adds no issue of its own.
 * The `list-view` route keeps the pointer; `listViewRouteMessage` still reads it
 * there, as the control that the pointer lives on and was not deleted.
 *
 * The objectui#8365 ruling (B, maintainer 「8365 同意」) refuses a stored view's
 * `kanban.groupBy` loudly 「at the read door of the view, visible to the author
 * of the view」. PR objectui#9236 installed that refusal on the `list-view` route
 * only: the `KanbanConfig` arm (`kanban.groupBy`) and the legacy-bag check
 * (`options.kanban.groupBy`). A named view on an `object-view` document is the
 * second route (`generateViewSchema`, objectui#9242), and its `listViews` is
 * unmirrored, so `safeValidateSchema` ACCEPTED the key there in both nestings
 * and kept it. This file pins the door that closes that.
 *
 * ## What is asserted
 *
 * - REFUSED through the published door (`safeValidateSchema`, which
 *   `objectui validate` runs): the protocol's `unrecognized_keys` at the block,
 *   naming the key (since objectui#11073; until then also objectui's pointer,
 *   a message EQUAL to the one the `list-view` route gives).
 * - DARK CONTROL: the canonical named view parses green through the same door.
 * - SCOPE CONTROLS: the door is not a mirror of `listViews`. An undeclared
 *   sibling in the kanban block is kept, a kanban block without the spec's
 *   required `columns` is accepted, and so is the legacy `options.kanban` bag
 *   without the stray key.
 * - SIBLING CONTROL: the calendar block on the same door is refused the same
 *   way, by the protocol, naming its retired spelling.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Inverted at objectui#7928, ⛔ no assertion deleted
 *
 * `listViews` is the protocol's strict `ObjectListViewSchema` record by
 * reference now (ruling A; director ruling on `options`, comment 5856694523).
 * So the protocol refuses the stray key itself (`unrecognized_keys` at
 * `listViews.KEY.kanban`), and this door adds the pointer beside that refusal.
 * The legacy `options.kanban` nesting is refused WHOLE (`options` by name) and
 * no longer judged inside. The scope controls that asserted "not a mirror" now
 * assert the mirror: an undeclared sibling, a block without `columns` and the
 * legacy bag are each refused by the record, and the door still adds no issue
 * of its own to any of them. Fixtures meant as canonical carry the protocol's
 * required `columns`.
 *
 * The reverse verification objectui#10321 recorded (unwiring the pointer turned
 * the REFUSED arms red) described the retired check; it is not re-runnable.
