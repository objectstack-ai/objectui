/**
 * ONE description of the form-field authoring contract — objectui#5542.
 *
 * ## The class this pins shut
 *
 * objectui#5040 was not a missing key. It was that **two descriptions of one
 * contract drifted**, and nothing could notice, because each was only ever
 * checked against itself. PR #5537 converged the two app-shell descriptions
 * into `packages/app-shell/src/views/metadata-admin/form-spec.ts`. A **third**
 * survived in this app: `FormPage.tsx` declared its own nine-key
 * `interface FormFieldSpec`, under the same name, in a different package.
 *
 * The measurement that chose the route: the console's copy was a strict subset
 * — 9 of the shared type's 26 keys, every one of them identical, none of them
 * console-only — sitting in a position that describes an **authored document**
 * (`FormSectionSpec.fields`, read straight off `/meta/view/:name`), not a
 * narrower thing this app authors. The narrow, renderer-honoured shape is a
 * separate type that already exists here, `RenderableField`. So the two names
 * were one contract, and the console's copy simply described it wrongly: legal
 * metadata (`visibleWhen`, `dependsOn`, `type`, `options`, `immutable`, the
 * recursive `fields`, …) was undeclared, which is #5040's own symptom — "the
 * type rejects the configuration the runtime accepts".
 *
 * ## What is pinned, and by which tool
 *
 * Two halves that fail in different places, on purpose:
 *
 *   • **`tsc`** — {@link formFieldSpecContractPins}. Type assertions are erased
 *     at runtime, so vitest proves nothing about them; the app's `type-check`
 *     script (`tsc --noEmit`, whose `include` is `["src", "dev"]` and therefore
 *     compiles this file) is what judges them. PIN A is the one that closes the
 *     class: it reads the field-spec type back out of the **exported**
 *     `buildSections` signature, so a re-inlined local copy fails here even if
 *     it agrees on every key on the day it is written. PIN B is its liveness
 *     control — it asserts that `Equal` still returns `false` for a type that
 *     really differs, so PIN A can never pass vacuously.
 *   • **vitest** — the `buildSections` block. It proves the widening is inert
 *     at runtime: a field spec carrying the previously-undeclarable keys builds
 *     the same rows. Whether each key is HONOURED is recorded rather than
 *     assumed — and that is not bookkeeping: `maxLength` was pinned here as
 *     NOT honoured, which is how objectui#5595 found that the merge dropped
 *     the override while the docstring promised it won. That assertion now
 *     names the honoured answer instead.
