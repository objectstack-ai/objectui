/**
 * `object-pivot` — `drillDown.mode` is refused on the prop type an author writes
 * against (objectui#10685, applying objectui#9002's ruling B to the sibling
 * blocks of `object-metric`).
 *
 * `ObjectPivotDrillDownConfig` in `@object-ui/types` declares the per-block
 * shape, and its own pin lives beside it
 * (`drill-down-per-block-10685.test.ts`). This file pins the other half: that
 * the component this package PUBLISHES takes that shape on `schema.drillDown`,
 * and not the shared `DrillDownConfig` that `PivotTableSchema` carries. The
 * refusal is worth nothing if the widget's prop still admits the shared type,
 * and that is a one-line regression in this package the `@object-ui/types` pin
 * cannot see.
 *
 * Read through the package entry (`../index`), so the type under test is the
 * one a consumer of `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` reaches.
 *
 * ## These assertions are compile-time only
 *
 * Judged by `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`, the second leg of this package's
 * `type-check` script, which resolves `@object-ui/types` through its BUILT
 * `.d.ts`. Vitest strips types; the `expect` only keeps this a collected suite.
 * Runtime behaviour did not change, so nothing here asserts any.
