 * Field types the PLATFORM computes — the value is machine-owned and no user

 * have no editor of their own.
 *
 * One set, three readers, so they cannot drift: `InlineFieldInput` renders them
 * as text instead of hijacking them into a record picker, and both editability
 * gates (`DetailSection`, `HeaderHighlight`) treat them as never inline-editable.
 * It lives beside `enrichDetailField` — deciding whether a column is
 * machine-computed is part of resolving a detail field's shape out of the view
 * entry plus the object schema, not the private business of any one component.
 * Re-exported from `InlineFieldInput` under its historical name.
 *
 * **Both spellings of the auto-number type are members** (objectui#4219).
 * `@objectstack/spec` — and the designer, and the importer — spell it
 * `autonumber`; `auto_number` is the widget map's key, and the alias table
 * (`fields/src/field-type-alias.ts`) maps both onto `field:auto_number`. This
 * set is matched by RAW spelling, so carrying one of them is carrying half the
 * type: `plugin-form` lists both in each of its non-input sets, and this is the
 * shape that was missing here. The gap was not academic — the reader that has
 * no host gate in front of it is `InlineFieldInput`'s reference fallback
 * (`!!field.reference_to && !TEXTUAL_REF_FALLBACK_TYPES.has(type)`), on
 * exported public API, so a spec-spelled auto-number carrying a `reference_to`
 * resolved into the RECORD PICKER — a list of records offered as replacements
 * for a machine-generated identity. The editability half of the same report is
 * held by the alias-aware shared exclusion since #4228; the two gates are a
 * union, and matching spellings is what stops that union's survivability from
 * depending on which spelling the metadata happens to use.

 * the cell renderer and the editor, and that selection keeps its usual
 * precedence (`viewFieldType || objectFieldType`) everywhere else. It can
 * therefore only ever *narrow* editability, never widen it.
 *
 * Before objectui#3355 both gates resolved a single effective type with that
 * same display precedence, so an authored non-computed type ERASED the object's
 * computed declaration from the gate's view. The app that reported
 * objectstack-ai/objectstack#5077 ships `{ name: 'supply_share', type: 'number' }`
 * — a display override worked around objectstack#5066 — over a hook-maintained
 * ROLLUP, and the header chip became inline-editable: a user overwrote the
 * computed value by hand and it stayed corrupted until an unrelated child-row
 * touch re-fired the rollup (downstream yinlianghui/hotcrm-heimao#61).
 *
 * The object schema is authoritative about what is machine-owned; a
 * presentation override has no business granting write access. Narrowing still
 * works — an authored `type: 'formula'` locks a plain object column, which is
 * how a view declares "this column is computed elsewhere".
