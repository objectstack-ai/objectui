 * `DetailViewSection.hideEmpty` — the FOUR-PARTY alignment pin (objectui#7129,
 * objectui#8603).
 *
 * ⚠️ The filename says `hideEmptyRetired-7129` and is deliberately kept. This
 * file is this key's lineage pin, not a pin on one verdict: the ruling that
 * created it was superseded for this key, and a rename would cost the history
 * that makes the supersession legible. What the four parties SAY is below and
 * is the only thing to read for today's contract.
 *
 * | party                                          | says                 |
 * |------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
 * | `@objectstack/spec` `RecordDetailsProps`        | ✅ DECLARES it (17.3.0+) |
 * | `@object-ui/types` `DetailViewSection`          | ✅ declares it        |
 * | `./zod/views.zod.ts` `DetailViewSectionSchema`  | ✅ mirrors it         |
 * | `RecordDetailsRenderer` + `DetailSection`       | ✅ READS it           |
 *
 * ## How the four got here
 *
 * They disagreed three ways, measured on PR #7123: the spec REFUSED the key at
 * 17.2.0, `@object-ui/types` declared it, the mirror omitted it, the renderer
 * honoured it — and the declaration was the only thing that made the key
 * writable, so on a spec-validated page the "author escape hatch" the
 * 2026-08-31 ruling described existed nowhere. The maintainer converged the
 * four on the spec's answer (2026-09-01, director-seat batch #28): retire the
 * declaration and the read, keep the spec refusing, keep the mirror absent.
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 then RE-DECLARED `hideEmpty` on the
 * `record:details` section entry (upstream #11289, maintainer ruling
 * 2026-08-23 direction 1, written from a measured symptom and with "the
 * renderer is unchanged" written into the declaration). The clause "keep the spec
 * refusing" thereby described nothing, through no act of this repo — and the
 * premise it rested on had been false upstream since before the ruling was
 * written.
 *
 * objectui#8603 (director seat batch #137 item 3, with the maintainer's
 * assent, 2026-09-15) ruled the protocol correct and RESTORED the read, superseding
 * #7129's Q1-A for this key. Q2-C — `DetailSection`'s auto-hide heuristic
 * owning the empty ROWS of a section that still has a filled one — is
 * untouched, and `record-details.emptySectionDefault.test.tsx` is where that
 * boundary is pinned on both sides.
 *
 * ⇒ The decision this file used to route to objectui#7122 has been taken.
 * That card closed `completed` on 2026-09-07 on an unrelated subject
 * (`CalendarConfigSchema.titleField`), so the routing pointed at a closed card
 * on a different question; the target is now objectui#8603, where the ruling
 * is.
 *
 * ## Why one file
 *
 * Alignment is a claim about FOUR sources at once, and each of them is green on
 * its own while the set disagrees — which is exactly how the divergence
 * survived. Pinning them separately reproduces that blind spot; pinning them
 * together makes any one party moving a single red test.
 *
 * ⚠️ Two same-named keys are NOT in scope here and must stay untouched:
 *   - `record:reference_rail`'s own `hideEmpty` prop (`../record-reference-rail.tsx`)
 *     — a different surface, a different renderer, its own component-level
 *     semantics, still registered as its own input in `../../index.tsx`;
 *   - the `detail.hideEmptyFields` i18n label (the "Show N empty fields"
 *     toggle's copy, in all ten locale packs) — a PREFIX match on the name,
 *     not this key.
