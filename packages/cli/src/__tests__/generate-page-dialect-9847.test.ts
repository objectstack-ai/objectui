 * objectui#9847 — everything `objectui generate` scaffolds spells its child
 * lists `children`.
 *
 * ## Why this pin exists
 *
 * `generatePage` is a PRODUCER in objectui#7181's sense: it writes a
 * `pages/NAME.json` into a project directory that the user then owns and
 * re-authors. It spelled that file's child list `body`, the dialect
 * objectui#6771 retires — and it is the SEVENTH such producer, the one
 * objectui#7181's table never named. Nothing pinned it, which is exactly how it
 * survived a migration round aimed at its own family.
 *
 * The ordering constraint this protects is the family's own: once the authoring
 * tier teaches `children` only, a scaffolder still emitting `body` produces a
 * project that the very next `objectui validate` rejects — a new user's first
 * two commands contradicting each other.
 *
 * ## The assertions run the GENERATOR, they do not read its source
 *
 * A source-text assertion over this file would be satisfied by a comment
 * mentioning the construct — measured on the sibling family and invisible to
 * the assertion's own result. So every claim here is taken off the bytes a user
 * actually receives: the generator runs into a throwaway directory and the
 * written JSON is parsed back.
 *
 * `process.cwd()` is the only input `generate` takes for its target, and
 * `process.chdir()` throws `ERR_WORKER_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION` under the `unit`
 * project's `pool: 'threads'`, so the cwd is stubbed for the one call and
 * restored immediately — the lever `app-generator.test.ts` already established
 * in this package.
 *
 * ## The type population is DERIVED, never listed here
 *
 * `generate` names its own types in the line it prints for an unknown one. The
 * sweep reads that line rather than repeating it, so a type added tomorrow is
 * covered today (AGENTS.md #9: point at the instrument that re-derives the
 * list, never write the list down).
 *
 * ⚠️ Stated so the sweep's zero is readable: the population is what `generate`
 * ADVERTISES. A branch of its switch that the printed line does not name is
 * outside this sweep by construction, not measured clean by it.
 *
 * ## Both directions, or the zero means nothing
 *
 * "No node spells `body`" is satisfied by a generator that wrote no nodes, or
 * by a walk that visited no file. Every absence assertion below is therefore
 * preceded by a lit control on the same bytes.
