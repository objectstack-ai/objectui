/**
 * FlowRunner — renders the interactive `screen` of a paused screen-flow run
 * (framework screen-flow runtime, ADR-0019) and resumes it with the collected
 * input.
 *
 * A `type: 'flow'` action launches a flow; when the run pauses at a `screen`
 * node the launch response carries `{ status: 'paused', runId, screen }`. The
 * host view (ObjectView / RecordDetailView) opens this modal with that state.
 * On submit it POSTs `/api/v1/automation/{flow}/runs/{runId}/resume` with the
 * field values as `inputs`; a `paused` response renders the next screen
 * (multi-screen wizards), a terminal response closes and refreshes the view.
 *
 * The screen BODY (flat fields / object-form) is rendered by the shared
 * {@link ScreenView} — the same renderer the Studio design preview reuses, so
 * the two can never drift (cf. #1927).
 *
 * ## The resume RESULT has to reach the user (objectui#5417)
 *
 * A dogfood walkthrough reported that a `400 FLOW_FAILED` and a successful run
 * "render identically: the dialog closes and the page is unchanged". Half of
 * that was already fixed by the time it was triaged — `interpretFlowResponse`
 * reads the ADR-0112 envelope and the `toast.error` below has carried its prose
 * since #4899 — but three gaps survived, and they are what this component now
 * answers:
 *
 * 1. **A terminal failure closed the dialog, taking the user's input with it.**
 *    The reason it closed is still sound and is NOT reversed here: on a
 *    `FLOW_FAILED` the engine has already consumed the suspension
 *    (resume-once), so a retry can only reach "No suspended run", and offering
 *    one is a lie. What #4899 concluded from that — *close* — is one way to
 *    withhold the dead retry, and it is the expensive one: the user has just
 *    typed a form they can no longer see, and the sentence explaining the
 *    refusal names a value that is now gone from the screen. So the dialog
 *    stays OPEN and the run's disposition is expressed the narrow way instead:
 *    `retryable === false` withdraws the submit affordance (the flat footer
 *    swaps Submit for a single Close; an `object-form` step drops `showSubmit`,
 *    which also stops a second Save from creating a DUPLICATE record — its
 *    first one was already persisted before the resume failed). Nothing offers
 *    a retry that cannot work; the input and the reason stay on screen
 *    together.
 * 2. **The message had one carrier, and it was the transient one.** The toast
 *    is kept — it is the console's failure idiom and it is viewport-fixed, so
 *    it survives a tall `object-form` step scrolled past its own header — and
 *    an inline destructive `Alert` (`role="alert"`) now carries the same
 *    sentence inside the dialog, next to the values that produced it.
 * 3. **Success invalidated the wrong thing.** Both hosts answer `onComplete`
 *    with `notifyDataChanged({ objectName: <this page's object> })`, which is
 *    the record the user is LOOKING at — never the record the flow WROTE. The
 *    reported run created a `crm_quote` from an Opportunity page, so the
 *    related list that would now contain it was never told, and the quote did
 *    not appear until a manual reload. This component cannot know which objects
 *    a flow touched (reading that out of the flow's output is a contract
 *    question, deliberately not answered here), so it invalidates `'*'` — the
 *    same scope, for the same stated reason, that `RecordDetailView`'s manual ⟳
 *    uses: everything mounted refetches in place over the #2269 bus, with no
 *    remount, so tab / scroll / inline-edit state all survive (AGENTS.md §5 #8).
 *
 * ## A REFUSED end is a notice, not a completion (objectui#7707)
 *
 * A flow can now end by saying no: an `end` node declaring `outcome: 'refused'`
 * carries a `message` template the engine interpolates per-record, and the run
 * records `refused` — terminal like `completed`, distinct from `failed` because
 * nothing went wrong (the maintainer ruling on objectstack#14945, whose contract
 * half is on the installed `@objectstack/spec` surface).
 *
 * Before that outcome existed the only channel that could interpolate
 * per-record text was a message-only `screen` node, which is an INPUT step
 * wearing a notice's clothes: it renders Submit, and submitting resumes the run
 * to `end`, where the terminal-success branch below toasted `Flow "…"
 * completed` at a user who had just been told the run was refused.
 *
 * So on `refused` this component renders the engine's sentence as a plain
 * (non-destructive) notice and takes the terminal disposition it already had a
 * route to: Submit withdrawn, a single Close. What it does NOT do is as ruled
 * as what it does — no toast of either colour, no `onComplete`, no
 * invalidation. The invoking action stays quiet on its own account, exactly as
 * today: a paused run returns `{ success: true, silent: true }` and `silent`
 * suppresses the action's `successMessage` at the ActionRunner's toast sink.
 * ⛔ That last part is a thing that WORKS — it is pinned, not touched.
 *
 * Copy goes through `@object-ui/i18n` (via the `@object-ui/react` re-export)
 * like its neighbours; the only English left in this file is the inline
 * `defaultValue` each key carries, which `check:i18n-keys` pins to its `en`
 * value. The server's own refusal sentence is passed through untranslated by
 * design — it is prose the backend composed, not a string with a key.
