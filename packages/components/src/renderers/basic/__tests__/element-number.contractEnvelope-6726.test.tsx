/**
 * `element:number` (`elements.tsx`) reads a `find()` answer as `QueryResult`
 * DECLARES it — and does NOT read `records` (objectui#6726).
 *
 * This is the block's client-side aggregate fallback: reached when the adapter
 * has no `aggregate()`, it pulls rows through `find()` and counts/sums them
 * locally. Its read was
 * `res?.data ?? res?.records ?? (Array.isArray(res) ? res : [])` — `records`
 * between the contract's one rows member and the bare-array arm.
 *
 * MEASURED on this tree, no producer emits `records` at this `DataSource.find()`
 * seam: `ObjectStackAdapter.normalizeQueryResult` CONSUMES the server/SDK
 * `records` envelope and returns `data`; every other `find()` in the repo
 * returns `data` or a bare array.
 *
 * What makes the `records` zero a reading and not a broken harness: the `data`
 * leg and the bare-array leg push the SAME three rows through the SAME mount
 * and both paint `3`.
