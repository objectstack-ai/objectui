/**
 * `convertFiltersToAST` refuses the two `$icontains` comparand shapes the
 * published table declares REFUSED (objectui#9001).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s `FILTER_TEXT_CASES` carries two REJECTION rows for
 * `$icontains` — an empty comparand and a non-string one — each with
 * `code: 'INVALID_FILTER'` and `mustMention: ['$icontains']`. `ValueDataSource`
 * has answered both since objectui#8748 (`refuseTextComparand`).
 * `convertFiltersToAST` answered neither: measured on `origin/main` `152f0a700`
 * (objectui#8996 and objectui#9019 both landed), both faces in one process,
 *
 * ```
 * $icontains ''   LOWER=["name","icontains",""]   MATCH=[] REFUSED(1)
 * $icontains 42   LOWER=["name","icontains",42]   MATCH=[] REFUSED(1)
 * ```
 *
 * — one authored filter refused by the in-memory matcher and lowered onto the
 * wire by the ObjectStack path. The acceptance-set split objectui#8568 and
 * objectui#8976 each closed on the operator-KEY axis, here on the COMPARAND
 * axis.
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and why in this shape
 *
 * The weak version of this file would be `expect(() => convertFiltersToAST({
 * name: { $icontains: '' } })).toThrow()` — satisfied by any throw, including a
 * bare `Error` from a converter that had simply broken, and blind to the half of
 * the contract that is the message. Four stronger claims are made instead.
 *
 *   1. **The contract's own rows are DRIVEN, not transcribed.** The rejection
 *      rows are read off the installed `FILTER_TEXT_CASES` at run time and each
 *      is pushed through `convertFiltersToAST`; the row supplies the filter, the
 *      `code` and the `mustMention` list. A transcribed contract drifts from the
 *      contract, and this file would then pin the drift.
 *   2. **The port is a MIRROR of `ValueDataSource`, checked by driving both.**
 *      Triage's ruling was *port, do not re-design*, and `mustMention` is what
 *      makes that load-bearing rather than stylistic: a differently-worded
 *      refusal is a different failure to honour the same contract. So the
 *      matcher's refusal text is captured live, its envelope stripped, and the
 *      converter's message must CONTAIN it verbatim. Neither face can drift
 *      without this reddening.
 *   3. **`ValueDataSource` still answers what objectui#8748 made it answer.**
 *      This card makes a SECOND path agree with the first; it does not edit the
 *      first. Pinned here so "the two agree" cannot be satisfied by having
 *      quietly moved the reference implementation.
 *   4. **The refusal is not "refuse everything".** A valid `$icontains` must
 *      still lower byte for byte, the sibling positive operators must be
 *      untouched, and the TRUE-identity tail must answer exactly what it
 *      answered before — a guard written as `!operatorValue`, or one that
 *      `continue`d instead of throwing, passes the rejection cases above and
 *      fails these.
 *
 * ⚠️ Deliberately NOT claimed: that the refusal reaches a real backend. What is
 * provable in this tree is the lowering and the two faces' agreement.
