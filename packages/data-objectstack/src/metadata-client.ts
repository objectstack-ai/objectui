/**
 * MetadataClient
 *
 * Thin, framework-agnostic HTTP client for the ObjectStack metadata
 * API (`/api/v1/meta/*`). Used by the platform Setup app surfaces in
 * `@object-ui/plugin-designer` (Object Manager, Field Designer, etc.)
 * so they can read and write protocol metadata without depending on
 * `ObjectStackAdapter` (which is a generic data-source binding and
 * carries a lot of view/dashboard-specific behaviour we don't need
 * here).
 *
 * Endpoints (see `packages/rest/src/rest-server.ts`):
 *   GET    /api/v1/meta                  — list all metadata types
 *   GET    /api/v1/meta/:type            — list items of a type
 *   GET    /api/v1/meta/:type/:name      — get one item (returns the
 *                                          unwrapped item content)
 *   PUT    /api/v1/meta/:type/:name      — save (overlay) one item
 *                                          honours `If-Match` for OCC
 *   DELETE /api/v1/meta/:type/:name      — reset overlay to artifact
 *   GET    /api/v1/meta/:type/:name/history — durable change log
 *
 * The client deliberately keeps the response shape opaque (typed as
 * `unknown`/generic `T`) so callers explicitly narrow per-metadata-
 * type, mirroring the framework's "single Zod source per type" rule.

   * (`POST /packages/:id/publish-drafts`) is a different route that discards
   * per-draft advisories server-side; that is objectstack#9343 and nothing here
   * compensates for it.
   *
   * ## Why there is no `{ success, data }` unwrapping here (objectui#6962)
   *
   * This method used to unwrap a dispatcher-shaped envelope before returning,
   * while {@link publish} — the same route, a couple of hundred lines down —
   * did not. Two spellings of one wire contract, and nothing said which was
   * right. The tolerance is gone because the route was MEASURED, at the
   * producer rather than inferred from the response schema:
   *
   *  - The only mount of `POST /api/v1/meta/:type/:name/publish` is the REST
   *    server's own route-manager registration, which answers
   *    `res.json(await protocol.publishMetaItem(...))` — the protocol's object
   *    verbatim, with no envelope branch. The project-scoped mirror
   *    (`/api/v1/environments/:environmentId/...`) re-mounts that same handler.
   *  - The `{ success, data }` envelope has exactly one producer, the runtime
   *    `HttpDispatcher`, and it does not serve this route: its `/meta` domain
   *    has no publish branch, the dispatcher's own route ledger has no row for
   *    it, and a three-segment `/meta` path that is not `/published` terminates
   *    in a located `routeNotFound`. So no composition — REST server, the
   *    dispatcher-only Hono adapter, or both — puts an envelope on this body.
   *  - `packages/spec` states the same split in the two docstrings side by
   *    side: `PublishMetaItemResponseSchema` describes "the FULL body" this
   *    route returns and records that the REST route hands the producer's
   *    object to `res.json()` verbatim, while its batch sibling
   *    `PublishPackageDraftsResponseSchema` describes a body answered
   *    explicitly "inside the dispatcher's `{ success, data }` envelope".
   *
   * ⛔ So an enveloped body on THIS route is not a shape the platform emits,
   * and unwrapping one is not a kindness: it is Commandment #0.1's lenient
   * fallback, a second de-facto contract for a route that declares one. It
   * also fails in the direction that hides the problem — a body that arrived
   * enveloped is one this door did not actually serve, and unwrapping it
   * would present that as a successful promotion.
   *
   * ⚠️ Sibling tolerances in this file are NOT this defect and must stay:
   * {@link listDrafts} reads `data?.data?.drafts` because `GET /meta/_drafts`
   * IS a dispatcher route, and `publishHealthFromResponse` unwraps because the
   * batch door really is enveloped. The rule is per-route, not per-file.
