/**
 * Query parameters for data fetching.
 * Follows OData/REST conventions for universal compatibility.
 *
 * The key set is CLOSED: the nine `$`-prefixed members below are the whole
 * contract. Every reader in this repository reads members of this set and
 * nothing outside it — `convertQueryParams` and `rawFindWithPopulate`
 * (`@object-ui/data-objectstack`), `queryParamsToRecord` (`@object-ui/core`'s
 * `ApiDataSource`) and `ValueDataSource.find` — so a key outside the set
 * reaches no branch and is dropped on the floor. The type refuses it instead
 * (objectui#7497).
 *
 * Until objectui#7497 this interface also carried a `[key: string]: any`
 * index signature described as "additional custom parameters". Nothing ever
 * read one: a census of every `find` / `findOne` call site and every
 * `QueryParams` literal across the packages, apps, examples, e2e and scripts
 * trees found zero non-`$` keys, and every adapter above reads only declared
 * members. What the signature DID do was make a misspelling compile —
 * `{ filter }` for `$filter`, `{ limit }` for `$top`, `{ options: { $top } }`
 * — and a published guide taught a test built on exactly that, which could
 * never pass (objectui#4734, #5458, #7497). Declared = enforced: the type now
 * says what the readers do, and `tsc` is the first gate a typo meets.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not reopen this with an index signature, a catch-all `extra` bag, or a
 * `$`-prefixed template-literal key. No reader consumes such a key, so each of
 * those is a declared-but-unenforced surface — the same defect in another
 * spelling. A genuinely new query option is a named member here PLUS the
 * branch in each reader that honours it, in the same change.

   * the MongoDB-style field-keyed record, or a `FilterArray` — the spec-owned
   * ObjectQL AST sugar (`@objectstack/spec/data`).
   *
   * Both forms are normal here, and the array form is not an edge case: the
   * repo's own canonical sink `mergeFilterNodes` / `toFilterNode`
   * (`@object-ui/core`'s `filter-converter.ts`) returns AST nodes, and its two
   * standing producers — `plugin-list`'s `buildEffectiveFilter` (grid and
   * export) and `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView` (calendar / kanban / gallery /
   * timeline) — have fed arrays through this slot all along.
   *
   * ⛔ Do not add a "tolerant conversion" in a consumer to cope with the array
   * path. The array IS legal input; a consumer that needs one shape lowers
   * through the shared sink rather than widening itself to tolerate the
   * producer.
   *
   * The authoritative acceptable set is the one `translateFilterToAST`
   * (`@object-ui/data-objectstack`'s `index.ts`) enumerates — five input
   * shapes, of which the array forms below are three. Read it there rather than
   * trusting a second list here; a partial restatement is exactly how two
   * operator vocabularies drifted apart before.
   *
   * Note the declaration does not *narrow* anything: `Record<string, any>`
   * already structurally accepts arrays (they satisfy its string index), so the
   * union documents the shapes that were always accepted rather than admitting
   * new ones. It is the description that was wrong, not the runtime.
