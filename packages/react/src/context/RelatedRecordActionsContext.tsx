/**
 * RelatedRecordActionsContext — host-provided CRUD + action handlers for the
 * child collections ("related lists") rendered on a record DETAIL page.
 *
 * The `record:related_list` renderer (in `@object-ui/plugin-detail`) knows the
 * child object name, the FK back to the parent, and the parent id — but it
 * lives in a low-level package with no access to the console's SPA router, the
 * create/edit form routes, or the per-object CRUD affordances / permissions.
 * Those all live in the app shell.
 *
 * So the host (e.g. `RecordDetailView`) provides this context; the renderer
 * calls {@link RelatedRecordActionsValue.resolve} for its child object and
 * wires whatever handlers come back onto the `RelatedList` (New / Edit / Delete
 * / row-click-to-open, plus the child object's own row actions). A handler that
 * is OMITTED means the capability is unavailable (permission or lifecycle
 * affordance denied, or no host routing) — the related list simply hides that
 * affordance. When no provider is present at all (e.g. the Studio designer, or
 * a standalone embedded renderer) the related list stays read-only, which is
 * the correct graceful fallback.
 *
 * Since objectui#4336 the same host also publishes its record-URL builder
 * ({@link RelatedRecordActionsValue.recordHref} / `openRecord`) for any object
 * it can route to, so the low-level renderers on a record page can turn a
 * lookup VALUE into a link to the referenced record without assembling a URL
 * of their own. Same provider, same builder, one route shape.
