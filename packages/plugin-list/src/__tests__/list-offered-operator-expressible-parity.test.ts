/**
 * Offered ⇄ expressible parity for the list toolbar's filter builder (#4736).
 *
 * ## The direction nothing guarded
 *
 * objectui has three operator-parity guards and all three sweep the same way —
 * spec vocabulary → objectui, asking whether every operator an author may
 * DECLARE is one this repo can render or bridge:
 *
 *   - `filter-operator-ast-parity.test.ts` (this package and `data-objectstack`)
 *     iterates `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATORS`;
 *   - `view-operator-builder-parity.test.ts` drives that same vocabulary
 *     through plugin-view's `specToBuilderOperator`;
 *   - `FilterConditionField.operators.test.ts` asks whether every spec
 *     `$`-token is reachable from the dropdown.
 *
 * None of them asks the reverse: is every id the DROPDOWN can draw an id this
 * consumer can persist? That is the direction that broke. `exists` / `notExists`
 * were added to the shared `FilterBuilder` by objectui#2942 so `$exists` would
 * be reachable from `FilterConditionField`, and they were offered to every
 * consumer — including this one, whose two dialects have no existence operator
 * at all. `mapOperator`'s `default:` arm returned the id verbatim and the query
 * went out as `['name', 'exists', 'x']`, which `isFilterAST()` rejects.
 *
 * ## What this file asserts, and why it is an equality
 *
 * The toolbar persists into TWO dialects, and a filter has to survive both:
 *
 *   1. **the live grid** — `convertFilterGroupToAST` → the array/triplet filter
 *      AST, gated by `isFilterAST()` over `VALID_AST_OPERATORS`. A rejected
 *      filter costs an unfiltered read or a 400; see the header of
 *      `filter-operator-ast-parity.test.ts` for that measurement.
 *   2. **save as view** — app-shell's `foldFilterGroupToSpecRules`, whose only
 *      operator transform is the spec's own `normalizeFilterOperator`, landing
 *      on `ViewFilterRuleSchema`'s enum. That fold cannot be imported here
 *      (app-shell depends on this package, not the other way round), so the leg
 *      below mirrors it through the same two spec exports and finishes on the
 *      SCHEMA rather than on set membership — the schema is what actually
 *      refuses the rule.
 *
 * The spine is `offers exactly the operators both dialects can express`: an
 * EQUALITY, not a subset check. A subset check is satisfied by a toolbar that
 * offers nothing, and it would let the opposite drift through in silence — an
 * operator that becomes expressible upstream and stays needlessly withheld.
 * Forcing equality is what makes the `OPT_IN_OPERATORS` entry in
 * `@object-ui/components` self-retiring: the day the view and AST vocabularies
 * gain an existence operator, this file goes red and says to offer it again.
