/**
 * The measurement that retired `FORWARD_COMPAT_FLOW_NODE_TYPES` (objectui#6982).
 *
 * That shim existed because the published `@objectstack/spec` `FlowNodeSchema`
 * declared `type` as a CLOSED enum, which spuriously rejected the `approval` and
 * `connector_action` nodes the running server accepts. It filtered exactly one
 * thing out of the flow gate's issue list: an issue addressed to `nodes.N.type`
 * whose node's own `type` was one of those two strings.
 *
 * ADR-0019 P2 opened that field to a validated non-empty string and has since
 * reached npm. Re-measured on the resolved spec (17.2.0, what pnpm installs for
 * the `^17.0.0` pin), the shim had become UNREACHABLE — not merely redundant:
 *
 *  - the node types it named parse clean, so the gate emits no `nodes.N.type`
 *    issue for them at all, and the filter had nothing to drop;
 *  - the one issue that path still yields is `too_small` on the empty string,
 *    and the shim already KEPT that one (its `nodeTypeAt` returns `''`, which is
 *    falsy), so deleting the shim moves no verdict.
 *
 * These pins are what make that deletion falsifiable. If a future spec re-closes
 * `FlowNodeSchema.type` — the exact condition the shim was built for — the first
 * test here goes red and names the premise that came back, instead of authors
 * rediscovering it as "the flow editor rejects approval nodes".
 *
 * ⛔ Do not relax these into `expect(res.ok).toBe(true)` on a single node type:
 * the open-string reading is the claim, and one accepted literal cannot
 * distinguish "the enum opened" from "the enum happens to list that literal".

/**
 * A flow that differs from a clean one only in its single node's `type` — plus,

 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.5.0 refuses a `connector_action` node without a
 * `connectorConfig` naming the connector and the action (objectui#11073). That
 * is a refusal about the NODE's config, addressed to `nodes.N.connectorConfig`,
 * ⛔ not a re-closed `type` enum — the next case pins exactly that — so the
