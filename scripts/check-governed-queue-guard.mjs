 *
 * ## The measured incident this exists for (objectui#6596, ruling 2026-08-27)
 *
 * PR #6183 touched `AGENTS.md` and was correctly parked as a draft for the
 * maintainer to merge by hand. A GitHub MCP `update_pull_request` call passing
 * only `reviewers` silently also set `draft: false`; the pull request entered
 * the merge queue and landed as `5b3290fd5` with no human approval. Converting
 * it back to a draft afterwards did NOT dequeue it. The tool fact is
 * objectstack-ai/objectstack#12200; the incident record and the decision are
 * objectui#6325.
 *
 * Every layer that could have stopped it was a layer of seat discipline, and
 * the failure had no seat in it at all — a hidden side effect on a tool call
 * plus a queue that does not release what it has taken. The maintainer's ruling
 * (「同意，并继续」, accepting Option A + C on #6325) is that the rule stops
 * resting on discipline: this file is the refusal.
 *
 * ## ⭐ The split by EVENT — the single most load-bearing decision here
 *
 *   `merge_group`   → a governed diff whose pull request carries no AUTHORIZED
 *                     APPROVED review is a REFUSAL. The queue build is the last
 *                     thing between a speculative merge and `main`, and it is
 *                     the path the incident took.
 *   `pull_request`  → the identical finding is an EARLY WARNING that exits 0.
 *
 * The pull-request leg must not redden, and not out of politeness. A governed
 * PR sitting as a draft awaiting the maintainer's own merge is the CORRECT
 * terminal state of this regime, so a check that is red on it is red on the
 * healthy case, forever — and a permanently red check trains everyone to ignore
 * red. The sibling repository retired a gate for exactly that (objectstack's
 * 2026-08-18 ruling, 红灯常态化本身有毒). The queue build is the opposite: a
 * state a governed PR should never be in at all, so red there is red on the
 * anomaly.
 *
 * ⚠️ Stated out loud rather than discovered: this guard CANNOT stop a
 * maintainer merging a governed PR by hand, and does not try. A direct merge
 * produces no `merge_group` event. That is not a hole — under this regime the
 * human merge IS the review record. What it closes is the seat path: flip
 * ready → enqueue → the queue is the entire review, which is the shape of
 * #6183 exactly.
 *
 * ## What satisfies the queue leg
 *
 * A latest-decisive APPROVED review by an account in `GOVERNED_APPROVERS`, on
 * WHICHEVER commit it was left. DISMISSED and superseded approvals (a later
 * CHANGES_REQUESTED by the same reviewer) never count; an APPROVED review by an
 * account outside that set never counts; an empty or unreadable review list
 * fails closed. The predicate is the EXISTENCE OF A HUMAN APPROVAL RECORD, and
 * says nothing about which bytes it was given for.
 *
 * ⭐ That is a REVERSAL of this file's first predicate, which required the
 * review's `commit_id` to equal the pull request's current head. The maintainer
 * ruled it out in the live PM chat on 2026-09-04 — quoted verbatim and
 * untranslated, because rewriting a ruling is rewriting the ruling:
 *
 *     「你的门禁有问题，只需要有人工批准记录就行，不需要卡最新的提交。」
 *
 * It was ruled while objectui PR #7473 was being approved over and over by an
 * authorized approver as its head moved: every push after an approval turned it
 * stale and reopened the refusal, so the gate spent scarce human attention
 * re-approving bytes nobody disputed. ⛔ The sha pin is RETIRED, not softened —
 * no predicate here reads `commit_id`, there is no stale bucket, and the
 * pull-request head read that existed only to feed the pin is gone with it. An
 * inert "stale" reading kept for old times' sake would be a field that can never
 * be non-empty again, and a reader would take its presence as evidence that this
 * gate still measures staleness.
 *
 * ⚠️ The self-test below still WRITES a `commit_id` into its fixtures, and that
 * is deliberate rather than leftover: "the commit does not matter" is only
 * measurable on cases where the commits actually differ, so grepping this file
 * for `commit_id` finds the evidence, never a surviving comparison.
 *
 * ⚠️ The accepted cost, stated out loud rather than left to be discovered: a
 * push after an approval is no longer re-reviewed by this gate, so an approved
 * governed pull request can land carrying bytes its approver never read — the
 * maintainer accepts that, and the DRAFT remedy below (a human merge, which
 * does read the final bytes) is still the one this refusal prints first.
 *
 * The preferred remedy is NOT approval, and the refusal text says so first:
 * take the pull request out of the queue, convert it back to DRAFT, and leave
 * the merge to the maintainer.
 *
 * ⛔ An agent seat never submits an approving review on a governed-surface pull
 * request, under any account. Every seat in this repository writes under a
 * shared GitHub identity, so `GOVERNED_APPROVERS` is a technical control that
 * is only as good as that normative rule — the same class as the seat-side
 * no-merge rule, and the reason the DRAFT remedy is listed first. ⚠️ With the
 * pin retired that rule carries MORE weight, not less: one approval now clears
 * every later push on the same pull request.
 *
 * ## Ordering: the path test runs FIRST, and a clear diff costs zero API calls
 *
 * ⛔ Fail-open on an API error is wrong in this file — it exists because
 * everything else in the chain failed open — so an unreadable review list is a
 * REFUSAL with its own exit code, never a pass. But a diff touching nothing
 * governed must never be blocked by an API hiccup either. The two are
 * reconciled by ORDER, not by tolerance: `runGuard` decomposes the diff and
 * returns before constructing a single request when nothing governed is in it.
 * The self-test pins that with a `fetchReviews` that THROWS if it is called at
 * all — a spy, not a mock, because "we did not need the API" is the claim.
 *
 * ## Multi-PR merge groups, and the under-enumeration trap
 *
 * A merge group can carry SEVERAL pull requests. `merge_group.head_ref` names
 * only the LAST one, so keying the whole group's diff to it would check the
 * wrong PR's reviews — and in the direction that reads as compliance: PR B is
 * approved, PR A's governed diff rides in behind it. So the group is decomposed
 * PER COMMIT: each first-parent commit is one PR landing, its number read from
 * its subject, and every governed PR is judged on its OWN reviews. A commit
 * that touches a governed path and names no pull request is UNATTRIBUTED — its
 * own refusal, with its own exit code.
 *
 * ## Why this is objectui-native rather than a pinned port
 *
 * The sibling repository runs this mechanism already, and this file follows its
 * shape closely. It is NOT registered in `scripts/upstream-port-pin.json`, and
 * that is a measurement rather than a preference:
 *
 *   - Upstream splits the mechanism over two files, and the register half
 *     (`scripts/pm/check-governed-merges.mjs`, 2,614 lines) is mostly a
 *     multi-repo post-merge audit plus a provenance-recompute engine for
 *     GENERATED artifacts sitting inside governed paths. This repository has
 *     none of those artifacts: `.claude/workflows/` does not exist here, and
 *     `skills/` carries no generator output (no `references/_index.md`, no
 *     react-blocks contract) — measured on the tree this landed against. Every
 *     row of that register is inapplicable, so a port would carry ~1,500 lines
 *     of machinery that can never fire.
 *   - `scripts/check-upstream-port-parity.mjs` cannot express that. Its
 *     `validatePin` refuses a divergence whose `ported` side is empty
 *     (`files[0].divergences[0].ported is empty`, exit 2 — measured directly
 *     against the shipped function), so a pin has no way to declare a DELETION.
 *     A pinned port here is structurally impossible, not merely undesirable.
 *
 * So the divergence is declared in prose, where a reader can act on it, and the
 * obligation the pin would have carried is stated instead: when the sibling's
 * predicate changes, this file is a hand re-read, not an automatic re-sync.
 *
 * ## The SECOND leg: the contract-review carrier (objectui#9018)
 *
 * Everything above is about GOVERNED SURFACES. This file also carries a second,
 * independent queue predicate, and it is keyed on a LABEL rather than on paths.
 * It is a re-implementation of the leg objectstack landed in its own guard
 * (objectstack#17040 → PR objectstack#17484, merged 2026-09-10 as `33e07f7c`),
 * against THIS file's shapes — the same relationship the rest of this file has
 * to its sibling, and for the same measured reason (see the section above).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE GOVERNING RULE DOES NOT LIVE IN THIS REPOSITORY, and saying so is not
 * pedantry — it is the difference between a citation a reader can follow and a
 * path they will grep for and not find. objectui has no `.claude/skills/pm-dispatch/`
 * tree at all (measured on the tree this landed against: `.claude/skills/` holds
 * `objectui-contributor` and `verify`, and nothing else). The rule is the PM
 * dispatch protocol's, and it lives in the sibling repository:
 * `objectstack-ai/objectstack` `.claude/skills/pm-dispatch/SKILL.md` 〈入队与落地〉.
 * The quote IS the operative criterion rather than a summary of one, so it is
 * reproduced verbatim and untranslated rather than paraphrased:
 *
 *   > 双肢命中任一 ⇒ 无席内条款②复核 PASS 在案 ⛔ 禁止入队
 *
 * with that skill's `references/contract-review.md` 〈载体纪律〉 supplying the
 * reading of the label itself: 「开着的载体恒 = 真实待审」. So
 * `needs:contract-review` on a pull request IS the gate, and until this leg
 * nothing mechanical read it at objectui's queue: the label's only occurrence
 * anywhere under `scripts/` was `CONTRACT_REVIEW_LABEL` in
 * `scripts/pm/check-half-states.mjs` — the PM half-state census, a report-only
 * instrument that never reaches a queue build.
 *
 * ⭐ THE HONEST BOUNDARY, and it is not a detail: this leg reads the LABEL, not
 * the verdict. Of the eleven enqueues objectstack measured for 2026-09-09, SIX
 * had the carrier stripped shortly before the enqueue with no PASS on record
 * for that head, and this leg passes every one of them — 「被剥」 and 「从未挂过」
 * are the same bytes to a label reader. Four of those six are objectui's own
 * (#8795, #8796, #8799, #8164), and objectui#8164 landed a real published-face
 * defect. ⛔ Reading that as "this leg would have caught #8164" is exactly
 * backwards, and upgrading this predicate until it does would make it a VERDICT
 * check — a strictly larger rule than the one ruled. ⚠️ objectui has no verdict
 * checker to defer that question to: the sibling defers it to its
 * `scripts/pm/check-clause2-carriers.mjs`, and this repository has no such file
 * (measured). `scripts/pm/check-half-states.mjs` H31 compares the gate's two
 * CARRIERS with each other; it does not answer whether a verdict exists either.
 * The CLEAR rendering says all of this out loud, so nobody reads a green carrier
 * leg as "the review happened".
 *
 * ⚖️ THE ACCEPTED COST: there is no cheap local pre-filter for this leg, because
 * a carrier is remote state a seat hangs rather than a property of the diff. So
 * unlike the governed leg, every merge group now costs one label read per queued
 * pull request, and a GitHub outage refuses a merge group whose diff touches
 * nothing governed. The zero-cost-clear rendering below is SCOPED to say so
 * rather than left making a promise this leg has taken away. Fail-open was the
 * alternative, and it is ruled out here by construction.
 *
 * ## Exit codes — the refusal is impossible to read as clean
 *
 *   0  CLEAR    — nothing governed in the diff (no API call was made), or every
 *                 governed PR carries an authorized APPROVED review, or this is
 *                 the `pull_request` early warning.
 *   3  REFUSED  — governed, and at least one governed PR carries no authorized
 *                 APPROVED review (none at all, unauthorized account, dismissed
 *                 or superseded).
 *   4  REFUSED  — governed, and the review list could not be READ. Distinct
 *                 from 3 on purpose: "nobody approved" and "we could not find
 *                 out" are different facts and must be separable.
 *   5  REFUSED  — governed paths on a commit attributable to no pull request.
 *   6  REFUSED  — a queued pull request carries `needs:contract-review`
 *                 (objectui#9018). The CARRIER leg, not the governed one, and
 *                 it fires on a diff that touches nothing governed at all.
 *   7  REFUSED  — the carrier leg could not READ a queued pull request's labels,
 *                 or the merge group names no pull request to read them from.
 *                 Split from 6 for the same reason 4 is split from 3.
 *   1  CANNOT RUN — unusable event payload, unsupported event, unreadable git.
 *                 Still non-zero, still red: this file has no green that means
 *                 "did not look".
 *   2  BAD USAGE — `--test` with no paths. Not a verdict about a tree.
 *
 * ## What this file does NOT do
 *
 * It does not make itself a required context. That is a branch-protection
 * setting only the maintainer can flip. What this repository CAN write down is
 * `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS` in `scripts/dependabot-merge-gate.mjs` — its own answer
 * to "which checks are blocking" — and `CHECK_CONTEXT_NAME` below is registered
 * there. Until the live required set carries the same name, this guard REPORTS
 * on a queue build without stopping it; the self-test pins the registration and
 * the workflow's `name:` so the two can never drift apart silently.

 * spelling that can drift from it would be worse than useless on a gate.
 *
 * ⭐ A REAL IMPORT IS POSSIBLE HERE AND IS STILL NOT TAKEN, and the reason is
 * this repository's own rather than the sibling's. objectstack mirrors the same

 * CYCLE (that file resolves a governed register with a top-level `await` that

 * no top-level `await` and no import of this file at all — measured, and pinned
 * below. The reason the mirror stays is AVAILABILITY, not cyclicity:
 *
 *   `.github/workflows/governed-surface-guard.yml` runs this file with NO
 *   install and NO build, and its own comment states the property that rests on
 *   — 「the script imports node builtins and one local module

 *   stops running" to every future edit of a file with entirely different
 *   constraints. `scripts/check-pre-install-import-graph.mjs` would catch a
 *   package appearing in that graph; it would not catch the load-time cost, and
 *   a gate that stops running is the failure AGENTS.md names as worse than no
 *   verifier at all.
 *
 * So the spelling is mirrored here and PINNED to H31's by reading THAT file's
 * SOURCE in the self-test — a constant asserting against itself proves nothing,
 * the same idiom the workflow wiring pin below uses. Drift in either direction
 * reddens. The self-test also pins the REASON, in the falsifiable direction:
