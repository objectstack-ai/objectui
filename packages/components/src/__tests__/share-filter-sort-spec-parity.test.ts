/**
 * `@object-ui/components` ↔ `@objectstack/spec` symbol-collision guards
 * (objectui#3159, objectstack#4115 burn-down batch 5).
 *
 * Six symbols here were declared under names the spec already owns. Four were
 * genuinely the spec's and now carry its binding (`ShareLinkPermission`,
 * `ShareLinkAudience`, `ShareLink`, `SortItem`); two model something else
 * entirely and were renamed (`FilterCondition` → `FilterBuilderCondition`,
 * `Field` → `FieldContainer`).
 *
 * `FilterCondition` is the case worth remembering. The tracking issue's own
 * cross-package guidance was WRONG about it once already: `@object-ui/app-shell`
 * has a `FilterCondition` too, and that one really is the spec's ObjectQL AST
 * (re-exported in objectui#3169) — so "app-shell re-exported it, do the same"
 * would have replaced this flat builder row with a recursive query type. Same
 * name, two different objects, two different verdicts. Triage per package.
 *
 * ## Why the spec's names are read through the compiler, not `import * as`
 *
 * A runtime namespace import sees VALUES only, and most symbols here are TYPES;
 * a tripwire built on `Object.keys(await import(…))` would pass while proving
 * nothing. So this reads each subpath's `.d.ts` through the TypeScript checker,
 * exactly as `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs` does.
 *
 * ## Later arrivals are APPENDED under their own card
 *
 * Six / four / two is a measurement of the batch-5 burn-down at the time it was
 * taken; re-counting it here whenever a new symbol arrives would make it
 * unreproducible. `SortDirection` (objectui#7265) is the first such arrival — a
 * module-local mirror in the DataTable renderer that rule 1 could not see until
 * its export filter was dropped. It went the BIND route, and because the
 * declaration is now an import rather than a derivation there is no local name
 * left to reach for: what is pinned below is the SPEC-side property the binding
 * rests on, the way the app-shell slice pinned its own module-local names. The
 * absence of the old declaration is pinned where the scanner can execute it, in
 * scripts/__tests__/spec-symbol-ledger-components-7265.test.ts.
