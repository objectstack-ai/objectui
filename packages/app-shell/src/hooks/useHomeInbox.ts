/**
 * useHomeInbox
 *
 * The inbox streams the Home work-dashboard surfaces:
 *   - pendingApprovalsCount — items waiting on the user (REST endpoint)
 *   - notifications         — latest in-app inbox messages (assignments/@mentions)
 *   - activity              — recent human activity feed (sys_activity), with
 *                             its status and the caller's read grant
 *
 * A deployment without the approvals plugin, the inbox pipeline or a
 * `sys_activity` object still renders Home: a MISSING object (404 /
 * `OBJECT_NOT_FOUND`) is an answer — this deployment has no inbox, so nothing is
 * waiting — and degrades to empty, exactly as `sharedUserFeeds.markUnavailable`
 * treats its own feeds.
 *
 * Every OTHER failure is NOT an answer, and `notificationsStatus` is what says
 * so (#4235). This hook used to swallow all of them to `[]`, which handed the
 * Home action centre the empty array and nothing else — so a denial arrived
 * wearing the shape of good news and the panel said "You're all caught up".
 * Measured, that is not hypothetical: objectstack#7344 recorded every non-admin
 * session taking `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` on this exact read
 * (`operation 'find' on object 'sys_inbox_message' is not permitted for
 * positions [org_member, contributor, finance, everyone]`) while
 * `/api/v1/notifications` — a projection of the very same rows — answered with
 * their unread messages. Admin sessions read the rows and saw the card work.
 * One build, one console pin, opposite screenshots, decided by who was signed in.
 *
 * The vocabulary is `MetadataProvider`'s per-type status, deliberately — see
 * #4300, which fixed the same class ("an unloadable app list is UNKNOWN, not
 * 'no default app'") and ruled one source of truth, no second dialect.
 *
 * NOTHING is fetched here (#4197, #4225). All three streams come from
 * `sharedUserFeeds`, which the top-bar bell reads too — on `/home` the bell and
 * these cards mount in one tree, so two owners meant the same read went out
 * twice per page. One fetch now feeds both, which is also what makes the bell's
 * badge and this card structurally incapable of showing different numbers.
 *
 * The inbox list was the last hold-out (#4225) and its own read carried the
 * #4316 defect: it queried `sys_inbox_message` alone, never joining
 * `sys_notification_receipt`, so it could not tell a read message from an
 * unread one and listed the five most recent unconditionally. A user who had
 * just read all nine in the bell came back to Home and found up to five of them
 * still filed under "Needs your attention", badged — while the bell two hundred
 * pixels above correctly showed zero. Read-state is not on the message row;
 * ADR-0030 resolved decision 2 puts it in the receipt, per recipient×channel.
 *
 * Both surfaces now cut from the shared feed's already-joined superset: the
 * bell lists all 20 and badges its unread topics, this card takes the UNREAD
 * ones newest-first and caps them at `limit`. The two cannot disagree about a
 * row's read-state because there is no second read left to drift.
 *
 * That left HOW MANY (#4329). The card's badge counted the list it renders, so
 * the cap leaked into it: nine unread read as "9" on the bell and "5" here.
 * `unreadTopicCount` is the count of the whole unread set, folded the way the
 * bell folds it — the list stays a capped preview, and the badge stops
 * reporting a preview's size as a total.
