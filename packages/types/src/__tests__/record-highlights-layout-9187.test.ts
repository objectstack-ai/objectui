/**
 * objectui#9187 — `RecordHighlightsComponentProps.layout` offered THREE values
 * where the contract declares two.
 *
 * The defect: this package declared `'horizontal' | 'vertical' | 'grid'` while
 * `@objectstack/spec` declares `z.enum(['horizontal','vertical'])` behind a
 * `.default('horizontal')`. So `{ layout: 'grid' }` type-checked here and was
 * refused at publish with `invalid_value` — a green local build and a
 * rejection at the only layer that matters. Direction is contract-first
 * (Commandment #0.1, and triage's ruling on the card): the declaration moves
 * to the contract, the contract is not widened.
 *
 * ── Three instruments, and they do NOT see the same thing ──────────────────
 *
 *   - `tsc` sees the `@ts-expect-error` leg and the `Equal` assertions. That
 *     is the half that reaches a TypeScript author, and it means nothing
 *     unless `type-check` runs — vitest strips types.
 *   - vitest runs the `safeParse` legs against the INSTALLED published spec
 *     artifact, each with a control that would have fired. ⚠️ Those legs read
 *     the SPEC ONLY: they were green before this change and are green after,
 *     so they are the PREMISE, never the evidence. They are labelled PREMISE
 *     below so nobody counts them as the fix.
 *   - vitest ALSO reads this package's own declaration as TEXT, so the
 *     reintroduction of a third value is caught even by a run that never
 *     type-checks. Its control is a three-value union elsewhere in the same
 *     file, read by the same matcher: an empty result on the highlights key is
 *     then a reading rather than a regex that cannot match anything.
 *
 * ⚠️ THAT CONTROL MOVED, and the move is the point. It used to be the
 * `layout` on `RecordDetailsComponentProps` one screen up, a three-value union
 * the contract refused by name. objectui#9040 item 1 RETIRED that member, so
 * this file's control leg was one of the three in-repo consumers that removal
 * had to migrate — and the ONLY one `tsc` could not name, because it reads the
 * declaration as text. It is now `RecordChatterComponentProps.position`, a
 * three-value union the contract genuinely declares, so the control no longer
 * depends on a divergence staying open to keep firing.
