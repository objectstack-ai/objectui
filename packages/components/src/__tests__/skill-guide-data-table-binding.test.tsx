/**
 * objectui#5126 / objectui#5337 — three published skill guides taught a
 * `data-table` bound with `bind`, and `data-table` reads no such key.
 *
 * `DataTableRenderer` takes its rows from `data: rawData = EMPTY_ROWS` off the
 * node (`renderers/complex/data-table.tsx`); the file contains neither `bind`
 * nor `useDataScope`. Copying the old example therefore produced no error and
 * no warning — a table with a correct-looking header over the "No results
 * found" empty state, which is the hardest failure shape for an AI author to
 * self-check. The guides also asserted a mechanism that belongs to a different
 * component: "the table component calls `useDataScope("customers")`".
 *
 * Direction was settled by objectui#5125 (merged PR #5338): the only
 * bind-reading table renderer was DELETED under enforce-or-remove rather than
 * promoted, so `data-table` does not gain `bind` — the teaching is what
 * changes. Today `useDataScope` is called by `list` and `tree-view` in this
 * package, plus the `object-*` widgets in the plugin packages.
 *
 * Three halves, and the first two are what make the third mean anything:
 *
 *   - COUNTER-PROBE. Each guide is asserted to still contain a `bind` key in a
 *     JSON block at all. Without it, "no `data-table` block carries `bind`"
 *     would also pass against a file whose fences this extractor cannot see,
 *     or one that stopped teaching `bind` altogether. A zero is not a reading
 *     until a known-present term proves the method works.
 *   - DOC-SAMENESS. The pin is on the guide bytes, not on a copy: the blocks
 *     are lifted out of the real files at run time, so re-introducing the
 *     defect in any of the three sites fails here.
 *   - BEHAVIOUR. The blocks the guides now teach are fed to the REAL
 *     `SchemaRenderer` and asserted to put rows on screen, and the retired
 *     `bind` form is fed to the same renderer and asserted to produce the
 *     empty state. The correction is verified against the renderer rather
 *     than against a reading of it.
 *
 * ⚠️ COLUMN SPELLING — this file is NOT spelling-independent, and an earlier
 * revision of this docblock said it was. It claimed the file "pins the BINDING
 * only … nothing below asserts a column key spelling". That was false and was
 * filed as objectui#5479: the BEHAVIOUR assertions below are on rendered CELL
 * TEXT, and a cell only has text when its column's accessor resolves — so they
 * transitively pin the accessor spelling the guides use. A docblock asserting
 * independence over assertions that were not independent is what made
 * objectui#5120's last step invisible when the family was ruled on.
 *
 * Both aliases have since retired — `label` in objectui#5351, `name` in
 * objectui#5120 — and the two guides' `data-table` columns migrated to the
 * declared `{ header, accessorKey }` in the same commit as the `name`
 * retirement, because these blocks are lifted and rendered at run time and
 * would otherwise go blank. That coupling is the point, not a defect: the
 * guides are executable fixtures, so the instruction corpus cannot drift from
 * the runtime without this file going red. Keep it that way — if a future
 * change makes the adapter's accepted key set narrower again, migrate the
 * guides in the SAME commit.
