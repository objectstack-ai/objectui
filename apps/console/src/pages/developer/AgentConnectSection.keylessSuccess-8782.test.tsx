/**
 * objectui#8782 — the agent-key generator's two failure modes must produce two
 * DIFFERENT sentences.
 *
 * Before: one `throw` behind a disjunction —
 *
 *   if (!res.ok || !data?.key) {
 *     throw new Error(json?.error?.message || `Request failed (${res.status})`);
 *   }
 *
 * so a response that was `ok` but carried no key reached the same template and
 * the real status got interpolated: a **200** was reported to the developer as
 * `Request failed (200)`. Nothing about the transport went wrong; the sentence
 * named the one layer known to have worked, and the thrown string is the entire
 * report `setError(...)` shows.
 *
 * ── Why the keyless-success arm is reachable (measured, not assumed) ─────────
 * The mint route cannot itself emit a keyless success: its only success is
 * `201` and it always carries `data.key` (objectstack
 * `packages/runtime/src/domains/keys.ts`, pinned at `expect(res.response.status)
 * .toBe(201)` in `http-dispatcher.keys.test.ts`). The arm is reachable through
 * the CONSUMER instead — `await res.json().catch(() => ({}))` turns every 2xx
 * whose body is not that envelope into `{}`: an SSO or proxy interstitial
 * answering `200` with HTML, an empty body, a gateway page. §3 drives exactly
 * that shape.
 *
 * ── The control ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * §3's load-bearing assertions are ABSENCES (no `Request failed`, no status).
 * An absence passes vacuously if the harness never produced an error at all —
 * a dead selector, a click that missed, a component that never threw. So §3
 * re-runs `errorTextFor` on a `!res.ok` response IN THE SAME TEST and requires
 * `/Request failed \(\d+\)/` to fire: same helper, same command shape, same
 * selector, same click. With the control lit, §3's zero is a reading. §2 is the
 * same control standing on its own as a regression pin for the `!res.ok` arm.
 *
 * ⛔ Out of scope, deliberately: `error.userMessage` and `error.code`
 * (objectui#7980, gated). The `json?.error?.message` read is pinned here
 * UNCHANGED by §1 — this card must not move it.
