/**
 * objectui#5115 — `objectui check`'s known-type list must equal the set of
 * component types this repository actually registers.
 *
 * The list it replaced was seventeen entries typed by hand into
 * `packages/cli/src/commands/check.ts`, with nothing holding it against the
 * registry. Measured on `origin/main` @ `8378e9954`, it had drifted in BOTH
 * directions at the same time:
 *
 *   `crud`, `gallery`  in the list, registered by nothing. `objectui check`
 *                      passed `{ "type": "crud" }` in silence while
 *                      `SchemaRenderer` painted the OBJUI-001 "Unknown
 *                      component type" panel for it.
 *   221 bare keys      registered, absent from the list — `object-grid`,
 *   + all namespaced   `object-form`, `card`, `div`, `view:grid` … all
 *                      reported as unknown.
 *
 * Both directions are pinned here, and BOTH matter:
 *
 *   list ⊄ derived  a phantom type gets a green light from the gate and a red
 *                   panel from the runtime. This is the direction objectui#5115
 *                   was filed for.
 *   derived ⊄ list  a real type is reported as unknown. Cheap-looking and
 *                   corrosive: at 221 false warnings nobody reads the output,
 *                   which silently costs the first direction its only reader.
 *
 * The comparison is EXTRACTIVE — the expected set is re-derived from source on
 * every run by the same `deriveRegistryKeys` that judges documentation
 * snippets (objectui#4823). No key list is written down here; a fossil copy in
 * the test would be the third hand-maintained copy of the thing whose
 * hand-maintenance is the defect.

   * repository's own `deriveRegistryKeys` — agreed that a page registration was
   * unused. They agreed because two of them were reading through this blind
   * spot, not because they were independent.
   *
   * The MECHANISM is pinned over fixture trees in
   * `check-doc-component-types.test.ts` — `resolves a namespace passed by
   * SPREAD` and its neighbours for what the derivation READS, and the
   * `reports options it cannot read` family for everything it refuses — which

   * deliberately separate — an assertion about key strings alone would also be
   * satisfied by a hand-edited generated file, and it is only the
   * byte-for-byte regenerability pin below that rules that out.
