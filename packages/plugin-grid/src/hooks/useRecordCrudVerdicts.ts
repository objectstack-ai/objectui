/**
 * May this user write THESE rows? (objectui#4296)
 *
 * The object-level grant is not the write verdict on a record. `writeScope`,
 * the sharing model and RLS narrow it per row, so a list that ANDs only the
 * object-level answer offers Edit/Delete on every row the user can READ —
 * including the rows the server answers `403 "You do not have access to this
 * record"` for. The record detail header has folded the record-grained verdict
 * since objectstack#3821 (`plugin-detail`'s `useRecordEditable`), which is why
 * one screen carried two opposite answers for one record and one user.
 *
 * This hook is the list-shaped half of the same question. It asks the SAME
 * authority the detail header asks — the explain engine's record-grained
 * verdict (`POST /api/v1/security/explain`, ADR-0090 D6 / ADR-0095 C2), the
 * same pipeline the enforcement middleware runs — so the kebab and the server
 * cannot disagree, and neither can the kebab and the detail header.
 *
 * ## One call per (object, operation) per page, not two per row
 *
 * The singular probe the detail header uses answers ONE record. Folding it into
 * a list row-by-row would cost 2N round trips (a 50-row page = 100 POSTs), and
 * that cost is why this card sat blocked: the batch form
 * (`recordIds: string[]`, objectstack#8326, shipped in objectstack PR #8452) is
 * what makes a page-level fold affordable. `records[i]` answers `recordIds[i]`;
 * each entry is the verdict the singular form returns for that id, so the list
 * and the detail header read the same number by construction rather than by
 * two implementations agreeing.
 *
 * ## Fail OPEN on every uncertainty — degrade to today, never over-hide
 *
 * No answer yet, a non-OK response, a deployment without
 * `@objectstack/plugin-security`, a row missing from the verdict map, a split
 * SPA origin where the cookie doesn't reach the API: the row's verdict is
 * `undefined` and the caller keeps the OBJECT-level answer, i.e. exactly what
 * this list rendered before this hook existed. The server is the authority
 * (the framework's ADR-0124 D1 — server enforces, client is courtesy) and
 * stays so; hiding a capability on missing data would be a worse defect than
 * the wasted click this fixes, and it is the same posture `useRecordEditable`
 * takes for the detail header.
 *
 * The probe rides the host's AUTHENTICATED fetch (`SchemaRendererProvider`'s
 * `apiFetch`) rather than the bare global one: a bearer-token session carries
 * its credential in a header, not a cookie, so `credentials: 'include'` alone
 * would 401 on a perfectly valid session and the verdict would always fail open
 * (framework#3923 ②, measured on the singular probe). Cookies stay on for
 * cookie-session hosts.

 *
 * ⛔ This is NOT an oversight to tidy up into the spec's response entry type,

 * `visible` as `boolean`, so asserting it here would make the runtime guards
 * below (`typeof entry.visible !== 'boolean'`) unreachable in the compiler's

 * redundant is not a tightening; it is a silent removal of the safety.
 *
 * The response-side contract-first move is not a type at all — it is
 * `ExplainDecisionSchema.safeParse(...)`, which is a BEHAVIOUR change (the

 * reduced-but-usable response this hook answers today would start failing

 * into a `true` or the reverse for the SAME principal, and a map keyed on the
 * principal alone kept answering from before the change.
 *
 * So the map listens to the data-invalidation bus the writers already announce
 * on, and forgets exactly what a change stales, by the bus's OWN matching rule
 * (`dataChangeMatches`): a record-scoped change drops that row's entries, both
 * operations; an object-scoped change drops the object's; `'*'` drops

 *
 *  - The bus carries writes THIS tab announces: every write through the

 *    own is never announced here, so it lands on the next page load. (Accepted
 *    when this route was ruled, objectui#10107 ACCEPT.)
 *  - A change is named by the object that was WRITTEN. A grant stored as a
 *    row of a different object — a record-share row, a permission-set
 *    assignment — is announced, when it is announced at all, against THAT
 *    object and not against the row it grants, so it does not match this
 *    row's entries either, and it too lands on the next page load.
 *
 * Module scope on purpose, like the map it guards: an entry must be dropped
 * even while no list is mounted to hear the change, or the next page visit
 * would publish it as the answer.
