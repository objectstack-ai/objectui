# ObjectStack Console

The **Console** is the reference application for [ObjectUI](/docs/guide). It renders a full-featured admin interface from JSON metadata — objects, views, dashboards, and actions — with zero custom pages required.

## Quick Start

```bash
# From the repository root
pnpm install
pnpm dev            # starts the console dev server (Vite)
```

The console opens at **http://localhost:5180** (the port is fixed in `apps/console/vite.config.ts`). There is no bundled mock backend — `apps/console/.env.development` ships `VITE_SERVER_URL` **empty** (same origin), and the Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to `http://localhost:3000` by default, so an ObjectStack server has to be listening there. See [Running with a Real Backend](#running-with-a-real-backend) to point dev at a different one.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multi-App Switcher** | Switch between the apps discovered from the connected server. |
| **Dynamic Navigation** | Sidebar renders from the app's `navigation` tree (objects, groups, URLs, pages). |
| **Object Views** | List / Grid / Kanban / Calendar — backed by `@object-ui/plugin-view`. |
| **CRUD Dialogs** | Create & edit records via schema-driven forms. |
| **Expression Visibility** | Show/hide navigation items using `visible: "${data.role === 'admin'}"`. |
| **Branding** | Per-app colors, favicons, and logos via `AppShell` branding. |
| **Command Palette** | `⌘+K` opens a searchable command bar for quick navigation. |
| **Studio Package Scope** | Studio home, metadata counts, quick-create links, and diagnostics follow the selected package. |
| **Design in Studio** | Workspace admins get a top-bar entry inside a running app that opens its owning package on the Studio design surface. On an interface route — a dashboard, page, or report — it deep-links straight to that surface's design page in the Interfaces pillar (`/studio/:packageId/interfaces?surface=<type>:<name>`, e.g. `surface=page:showcase_crm_workbench`); elsewhere (objects, the app root) it opens the package's Data tab (`/studio/:packageId/data`). These interfaces are authored in Studio — there is no in-page edit panel. |
| **App Creation Wizard** | 4-step wizard (Basic Info → Objects → Navigation → Branding) to create or edit apps. |
| **Record Approvals Tab** | A record with approval requests grows an Approvals tab on its detail page (peer of Details/Related, with a request-count badge) — current step, decision progress, resolved "waiting on" approvers, the merged decision timeline, and a submitter remind button — visible to every viewer who can read the record, not just approvers. |
| **Error Boundary** | Graceful error handling with a retry button. |

### Object design (Studio Data tab)

Selecting an object in Studio's **Data** pillar (`/studio/:packageId/data`) opens a
tab strip over that object — **Records · Form · Validations · Hooks · Actions ·
API · Settings**. Each of Validations, Hooks and Actions is a no-code **config
panel driven by the corresponding metadata**, and each supports **adding** new
entries — no code round-trip required:

| Tab | Edits | Panel |
|-----|-------|-------|
| **Validations** | the object's inline `validations[]` (spec `ValidationRuleSchema`) | Master-detail covering **every** rule type — `script`, `cross_field`, `state_machine`, `format`, `json_schema`, `conditional`. The **New** menu adds any type (seeded with a valid, never-firing skeleton); a rule's type can be switched in place. CEL predicates reuse the shared `ConditionBuilder`, fed the object's draft fields. |
| **Hooks** | the separate `hook` metadata type targeting this object | Master-detail whose editor is the platform `SchemaForm` **driven by the live `hook` JSONSchema from `/meta/types`**, so its fields and enums always match the running server's contract. |
| **Actions** | the object's inline `actions[]` (spec `ActionSchema`) | Master-detail using the type-aware `ActionDefaultInspector`; anything not curated falls through to a **"More fields"** form fed the live `action` JSONSchema, so no spec property is un-editable. |

Validations and Actions persist with the object's own **Save draft**; Hooks (a
distinct metadata type) save per-hook. Nothing goes live until the package is
published from the top-bar **Publish** flow.

#### Why a configured action can be missing from the app

An action that is saved, published and correctly placed can still appear on no
surface at all. There are two reasons, and the Actions panel states both — the
running app deliberately states neither, because an end user should not be told
about capabilities they do not have.

* **No placement.** `locations` is empty, so the action surfaces nowhere.
  A selection-only action is legitimate here: it is placed by a list view's
  `bulkActions` / `bulkActionDefs` instead.
* **The capability gate.** `action.requiredPermissions` (ADR-0066 D4) is
  enforced with a 403 on the platform action route and **mirrored as a UI
  hide**: a viewer who does not hold every listed capability gets no button,
  no greyed-out control and no message, at every declared location at once.
  This is intended — the client hide mirrors an enforcement the server applies
  regardless, and an unentitled user is never shown a control they cannot use.

The **Placement** section of the action inspector names the gating capabilities
and says the action is hidden rather than disabled; when the signed-in session
is itself missing one of them it says so too, so "I configured the buttons and
I see none of them" has an answer on the screen where the buttons were
configured. The read-only **action preview** beside it carries the same
capability line, so its *Where it appears* frames are not read as a promise
that everyone will see the button there.

An unheld capability is not the same problem as a *misspelled* one: a
capability string registered nowhere is caught separately, by the advisory
capability-reference lint that runs over pending drafts during **Publish**.

## Configuration

**The console has no configuration file.** It declares no apps, objects or views of its own —
it renders whatever the server it is pointed at publishes. There are only two inputs:

**1. `VITE_SERVER_URL` — which backend to talk to.** A build-time Vite variable, and the only
setting the console itself owns. It seeds the data adapter's base URL and the runtime-config
fetch; `apps/console/.env.development` ships it **empty**, which means same origin — the
Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to the backend. See [Running with a Real Backend](#running-with-a-real-backend).

**2. Server-pushed runtime config — everything else.** Before React mounts, the console
resolves `/api/v1/runtime/config` from that server and applies it: product branding, feature
flags (marketplace, AI Studio, SSO, custom domain), and the cloud URL. Operators configure
these on the **server**, not in the SPA, which is why changing them needs no console rebuild.

Apps, objects and views themselves are metadata fetched over HTTP — discovered at connect
time and loaded on demand. To change what the console shows, change the metadata on the
server: author it in the ObjectStack server project (`objectstack.config.ts` lives **there**,
not here) or edit and publish it from Studio. See
[ObjectOS Integration](/docs/guide/objectos-integration) for the server-side configuration
shape.

## Running with a Real Backend

`VITE_SERVER_URL` is the setting that decides which backend the console talks to — the data adapter, auth, i18n and action endpoints all hang off it.

1. In dev, leave `VITE_SERVER_URL` empty and point the dev proxy at your server instead.
   Only `/api/*` is proxied, to `DEV_PROXY_TARGET` when set and `http://localhost:3000`
   otherwise:
   ```bash
   DEV_PROXY_TARGET=https://demo.objectstack.ai pnpm dev
   ```
   This keeps the page and the API on one origin. Setting `VITE_SERVER_URL` to an absolute origin still works, but it opts dev out of same-origin and into CORS — an absolute `VITE_SERVER_URL` is the right setting for a *built* console deployed apart from its backend.
2. The console will use the ObjectStack client to discover metadata and perform CRUD operations against the server.

## Where the Code Lives

Most of what you see in the console does not live in `apps/console`. The shell and layout, sidebar, header, command palette, object list and record detail views all ship from **`packages/app-shell`** (`@object-ui/app-shell`), so any host application can mount the same experience; the heavier view surfaces (grid, kanban, calendar, charts, designer) come from the `@object-ui/plugin-*` packages.

`apps/console` is the assembly layer on top: it owns the route tree, registers the plugin set, wires the backend connection, and adds the surfaces specific to this app (auth pages, the docs portal, system and settings pages). So when you want to change something you *see* in the console, look in `packages/app-shell` first.
