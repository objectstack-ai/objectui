/**
 * Approvals Inbox — the raw payload snapshot is a platform-operator affordance,
 * never the business approver's read path (objectui#5553).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The detail drawer's "Raw data (JSON)" panel rendered on `payload != null`
 * alone — no principal check of any kind — so every business approver was
 * handed the submitted record's complete raw row: internal ids, `created_by` /
 * `updated_by` / `owner_id` / `organization_id`, bare lookup ids, and the
 * fields the object's metadata declares `hidden: true`. Reported from a live
 * EHR deployment on 17.1.0 (objectstack#10734), where that declaration is a
 * patient-data control. Per the maintainer's ruling the panel does not render
 * for a business approver by default; holding a platform-admin-only capability
 * (`studio.access`, via `holdsStudioAccess`) is what restores it.
 *
 * ## Why every absence case here carries a counter-probe
 *
 * The acceptance condition is that something does NOT render, and a suite that
 * renders nothing at all reproduces that perfectly. So each denial case also
 * asserts the drawer it is denying inside — the process label and the business
 * summary row — and the `studio.access` case renders the SAME fixture through
 * the SAME helper and finds the panel. An empty render fails the counter-probe;
 * a gate stuck open fails the denials. Neither can pass alone.
 *
 * ## The witnesses
 *
 * `created_by` and `organization_id` are bookkeeping columns to the page's
 * `isBookkeepingKey` (`@object-ui/types`' `isSystemManagedField`, objectui#11677),
 * so the summary card already drops them: their values can reach the DOM only
 * through the raw panel. That makes them exact witnesses for "the panel
 * rendered", not proxies. (Both are also long enough to trip the summary's
 * opaque-id filter, so neither can slip in by a second route.)
 *
 * ## ⛔ What this deliberately does NOT assert
 *
 * Nothing here says the summary card is trimmed by object metadata. This card
 * is the gate only; trimming the payload by `hidden: true` and the server-side
 * residual (the snapshot reaching the client unfiltered at all) are separate
 * and are tracked elsewhere. Asserting them here would pin behaviour this
 * change does not deliver.
 *
 * No build artifact sits between the edit and this test: the root Vitest config
 * aliases every `@object-ui` specifier at that package's source directory, and
 * the page under test is this app's own source.
