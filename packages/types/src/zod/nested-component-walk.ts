/**
 * NESTED COMPONENTS IN A PROPS BAG — found by the spec's walk, judged by the
 * node union (objectui#11223).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * A `page:` container takes its child list in its props bag:
 * `properties.children` on `page:card` / `page:section` / `page:footer` /
 * `page:sidebar`, and `properties.items[].children` on `page:tabs` /
 * `page:accordion`. Their arms read the spec's `ComponentPropsMap` rows by
 * reference (`propsBag` in `./public-blocks.zod.ts`), and every one of those
 * slots is `z.array(z.unknown())` in the row. So `safeValidateSchema` (what
 * `objectui validate` runs) and `StrictAnyComponentSchema` never looked inside
 * a bag child list: a malformed nested block, or a nested `type` no arm
 * declares, parsed green, while the same child written in a node-level child
 * slot is judged by the node union at every depth (objectui#8344).
 *
 * ## The positions are the spec's, READ — ⛔ not a list written here
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` exports ONE walk over page composition:
 * `walkAddressedPageComponents` (`@objectstack/spec/system`), which its own
 * contract names "THE one traversal" behind `translatePage` and the platform
 * CLI's i18n extractor, with the descent rule living "here and ONLY here".
 * {@link nestedComponentsOf} hands a node to that walk and reports what it
 * visited. Nothing in this module names a bag key: a position the spec's walk
 * gains is judged here the day the installed spec carries it, and
 * `../__tests__/nested-page-children-11223.test.ts` re-derives the walk's
 * positions from the installed spec on every run and fails if this module
 * stops judging one of them.
 *
 * The spec's `COMPONENT_CHILD_KEYS` / `mapComponentTree` (its conversions
 * walk) are module-private, and `@objectstack/lint`'s `walkPageComponents` is
 * not a dependency of this package, so neither is read. ⚠️ The three walks do
 * not agree on `page:card`'s `properties.footer` — a slot its row declares and
 * its renderer draws, which the lint walk descends and the exported walk
 * deliberately does not. This module follows the exported walk, so that slot
 * is not judged here yet; objectui#11223 records the disagreement for the spec
 * to settle, and the pin file holds the gap as a row that turns red the day
 * the walk descends it.
 *
 * ## How a visited component is located
 *
 * The walk hands its visitor the component, never a path. Its contract does
 * say what happens to the visitor's return value: it REPLACES the node in the
 * rebuilt tree the walk returns, at the node's own position, with the node's
 * rebuilt child lists re-attached under the same keys. So the visitor returns a
 * marker object, and a generic scan of the rebuilt tree reads each marker's
 * position back. The scan knows no key names either — it descends every own
 * enumerable member and stops at the first marker on each branch, so what it
 * reports is the node's DIRECT nested components; deeper ones are reached when
 * each of those is judged in turn by the same union.
 *
 * Entries the walk does not visit — a string, a number, `null`, an array — are
 * not components to it and are not reported here, as the spec's own contract
 * says of them ("pass through unvisited").
 *
 * ## The judgment, and why it is rebindable
 *
 * {@link nestedComponentJudgment} is a check for the node union: for each
 * nested component it runs the judge — the union itself — and re-issues the
 * judge's issues at the component's real path (`properties.children.0.…`). It
 * runs even when the node carries issues of its own, so an author sees both at
 * once, as a node-level child slot reports them.
 *
 * A check is a closure, and the strict authoring face copies checks as they
 * are, so a closure that consults the tolerant union would keep consulting it
 * on the strict face (the limit `../strict-authoring-face.ts` names). This one
 * is registered, and the strict walker re-points it at its OWN twin of the
 * judge through {@link rebindNestedComponentJudgment}: on the strict face a
 * nested component is judged strictly, unknown keys refused by name.
