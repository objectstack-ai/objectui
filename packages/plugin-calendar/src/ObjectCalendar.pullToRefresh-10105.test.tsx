/**
 * objectui#10105 — the pull-to-refresh gesture arms on BOTH of
 * `ObjectCalendar`'s data paths.
 *
 * ## The asymmetry this pins
 *
 * `usePullToRefresh` (`@object-ui/mobile`) hands back an OBJECT ref, so
 * nothing tells the hook when a consumer attaches it. It used to bind its
 * native touch listeners in an effect keyed only on its own handlers and
 * `enabled`, which reads `ref.current` once and then waits for one of those
 * to change. On the internal-fetch path the component's first commit is the
 * loading screen, so that one read found `null`; when the rows arrived the
 * host `div` mounted, but none of the effect's dependencies had changed, so it
 * never ran again and the gesture was dead. With pre-fetched `data` the first
 * commit already contains the host, so the same gesture worked. That is why
 * this file has two arms and not one.
 *
 * ## Why two arms and not one
 *
 * - The INTERNAL-FETCH arm is the one that went red on the defect.
 * - The PRE-FETCHED arm is the lit control. It was green before the repair and
 *   must stay green after it, so a repair that disarms the gesture everywhere
 *   cannot pass as a fix.
 *
 * ## The gesture is the hook's own event sequence, not a scripted scroll
 *
 * `touchstart` → `touchmove` → `touchend` on the host, which is where the
 * hook binds. A scripted `scrollTop` or a direct call to the refresh callback
 * would skip the listeners, and the listeners are the part that was missing.
 * happy-dom does not build a `TouchList` from a plain init object, so the
 * events are built by hand with `touches` attached. The start point is y=10
 * and not y=0 because the move handler ignores a falsy start point.
 *
 * ## What "refreshed" means on the internal-fetch arm
 *
 * A release past the threshold calls `onRefresh`, and on this path that
 * bumps the key the fetch effect depends on. So the check is a second
 * `find` call. That refetch puts the component back on its loading screen,
 * and the loading screen carries no ref, so the ref goes back to `null` until
 * the rows return. The second `find` is held open here so the test can see
 * the loading screen. A second gesture after the rows return then checks that
 * the gesture arms again after that round trip. (React may reuse the same
 * root `div` for both screens, since they share a type and a position, so the
 * pin does not assert on element identity. The hook's own pin covers a truly
 * replaced element.)
 *
 * ## Effects are flushed before each gesture
 *
 * The hook binds in a passive effect. A `waitFor` can resolve on the DOM
 * mutation of a commit before that commit's effects have run. So each gesture
 * starts with `await act(async () => {})`. That makes the timing
 * deterministic, and it cannot rescue the defect: the old binding effect did
 * not re-run however often effects were flushed.
