/**
 * objectui#7206 — the CONTEXT tail of the record resolution is RETIRED, and the
 * retirement is observable rather than merely declared.
 *
 * `LookupField` and `useCascadingOptions` both resolved the record they gate on
 * as `dependentValues ?? ctx.formValues ?? ctx.data ?? {}`. The last two links
 * never existed: `SchemaRendererContextType` (`@object-ui/react`) declares
 * exactly `dataSource`, `debug`, `debugFlags` and `apiFetch`, and
 * `SchemaRendererProvider` accepts no other prop — so the tail was UNSETTABLE,
 * not merely unset, and three comments in the tree described it as a working
 * "record scope" channel a host could fill. Retired under ADR-0049
 * enforce-or-remove; maintainer ruling 2026-09-18 (letter C). The host supplies
 * the record on `dependentValues`, and a host that does not fails VISIBLY — a
 * gated picker, a gated option list — which is the failure the ruling chose
 * over a documented fallback that never fired.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists, when nothing observable changed in production
 *
 * Exactly so. No host could set those members, so no production surface moves —
 * which is precisely what makes the retirement invisible to every existing
 * behavioural test, and what would let a later author re-add the tail with the
 * whole suite green. Reaching the retired links at all takes a CAST onto the
 * context value, and that is what each SUBJECT below renders: the members
 * spelled the way the deleted reads spelled them.
 *
 * ## The shape of each assertion: a live control on every zero
 *
 * Every "the context does nothing" assertion is paired with the SAME record
 * moved onto `dependentValues`, asserted to still do the thing. Without that
 * pair a zero here is equally satisfied by a harness that gates everything, or
 * narrows nothing — rather than by the retirement.
 *
 * ⛔ The pins are keyed on the READ, never on the identifier: both widgets'
 * comments still NAME `ctx.formValues` / `ctx.data` to say they are gone, so a
 * source-text assertion on those spellings would pass with the reads restored.
