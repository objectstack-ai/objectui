/**
 * objectui#10719 — the eight "Phase 3.5" field-validation types are RETIRED from
 * `@object-ui/types`.
 *
 * `AdvancedValidationSchema`, `AdvancedValidationRule`, `ValidationRuleType`,
 * `ValidationFunction`, `AsyncValidationFunction`, `ValidationContext`,
 * `AdvancedValidationResult` and `AdvancedValidationError` were the type half of
 * `@object-ui/core`'s `ValidationEngine` vocabulary. Maintainer ruling A on
 * objectui#7659 (decision batch #40, item 4, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove) retired
 * the engine because nothing consumed it; triage carried that ruling to its type
 * half on objectui#10719. The zero-reader measurement is recorded on the card and
 * is not re-derived here.
 *
 * ⛔ Not this retirement: `FieldValidationRules` (the type of the live field
 * `validation` key), `FieldValidationFunction`, `ObjectValidationRule` and
 * `DesignerValidationRule`. Two of them are firing controls below, so this file
 * also fails if the retirement ever takes one of them along.
 *
 * What this pins, both halves of the objectui#7659 shape:
 *
 *   - compile time: none of the eight resolves through the root barrel (the face
 *     an external consumer imports) or through the declaring module. Compiled by
 *     this package's `tsconfig.test.json`, chained off `type-check`; a name that
 *     comes back fails there with "Unused '@ts-expect-error' directive". The
 *     controls resolve live neighbours through the identical `import('…')`
 *     spellings with no directive, so a broken specifier cannot satisfy the
 *     directives for the wrong reason.
 *   - runtime: the barrel and the declaring module are read as TEXT, so a
 *     re-introduced declaration or re-export reddens even in a run that never
 *     type-checks.
 *
 * ⚠️ Why the runtime half is a source read and not objectui#7659's
 * `Object.keys(entry)` probe: all eight were `export type`, so none of them was
 * ever an own key of the runtime namespace. Measured at this change on the tree
 * before the retirement: the built entry's namespace carried none of the eight
 * while its `.d.ts` still exported all of them. That probe reads the same in both
 * worlds, so it cannot fail, and writing it would make this file look better
 * covered than it is. objectui#8800's retirement pin in this directory records
 * the same reason.
 *
 * Deleting this file is deleting the ruling. Bringing any of the eight back is a
 * new published-contract decision, not an edit here.
