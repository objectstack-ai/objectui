/**
 * The root README's "Kanban Board" example must survive the validator a reader
 * hands it to — `@object-ui/types/zod`'s `safeValidateSchema` (objectui#8256).
 *
 * ## The defect this closes
 *
 * The example authored its lanes as `{ value, label, color }`. The document is
 * a `type: "object-kanban"` one, so `objectql.zod.ts#ObjectKanbanSchema` judges
 * it, and that face declares `columns` as a union of two ARRAYS — bare value
 * strings, or `{ id, title }` lanes (objectui#8913). A `{ value, label }` lane
 * is neither, so the whole document was refused with a single `invalid_union`
 * at `columns`. A reader who copied the block got a rejection.
 *
 * ## Why no gate saw it, measured on this tree rather than assumed
 *
 * Gates DO read this README's `json` fences — `check:doc-types` reads every
 * `type` literal in them and `check:doc-fences` reads their language tag, both
 * widened onto the root page by objectui#7115. Neither VALIDATES the fence:
 * `check:doc-types`'s own header names "whether the snippet's OTHER keys are
 * read by the renderer" as the question it deliberately does not answer, and
 * `check:doc-snippets` / `check:doc-examples` compile `ts`/`tsx` fences, of
 * which a `json` block is not one. So the document could be refused by the
 * shipped schema with every check green — which is the hole this file closes
 * for this one example, the way `plugin-gantt`'s
 * `readme-navigation-example.test.ts` closes it for that package's README.
 *
 * ## The example is EXTRACTED, never retyped
 *
 * A hand copy drifts from the page it claims to pin and therefore pins nothing.
 * A moved heading, a removed fence or a non-JSON body throws out of the
 * extractor rather than passing vacuously on an empty fixture.
 *
 * ## The green carries its own control
 *
 * A `safeValidateSchema` that succeeds proves nothing if the validator accepts
 * everything, so the HISTORICAL lane shape is parsed alongside and must be
 * refused. ⚠️ And the third leg is the reason a TEXT assertion is needed at
 * all: on this face `color` is NOT a named refusal. `ObjectKanbanLaneSchema` is
 * a plain strip-postured `z.object`, so a lane carrying `color` PARSES and the
 * key is dropped from the parsed document. (The named refusal for `color` lives
 * on `complex.zod.ts#KanbanColumnSchema`, which judges nothing authored today:
 * the bare `kanban` arm it served retired in objectui#8802.) An
 * accepted-and-dropped key cannot be caught by validity alone.
