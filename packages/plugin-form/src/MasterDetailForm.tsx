/**
 * MasterDetailForm — enter a parent record together with its child "line
 * items" in a single screen, and persist them as one client-orchestrated
 * transaction (see ADR-0001).
 *
 * The parent fields are rendered by the existing <ObjectForm>; the child
 * collection(s) by <LineItemsField>. On submit we build ONE ordered
 * cross-object operation list — parent create/update as op 0, each child a
 * create/update/delete linked to it (via `{ $ref: 0 }` on create, or the
 * known parent id on edit) — and hand it to `dataSource.batchTransaction`
 * through {@link runBatchTransaction}. Client-side rollups are folded into the
 * parent payload so they commit in the same batch.
 *
 * The form is deliberately ignorant of atomicity: a server with the
 * transactional `/api/v1/batch` endpoint commits all-or-nothing, while an
 * adapter without one emulates the batch internally (sequential writes with
 * best-effort compensation, see `emulateBatchTransaction` in `@object-ui/core`).
 * Either way there is no master-detail-specific cleanup code here (ObjectStack
 * objectui #2679 / framework ADR-0034 item 4).
 *
 * No `@objectstack/spec` change: the relationship is a `master_detail` (or
 * `lookup`) FK on the child object.

 * Give every authored detail entry an identity that does not change when a

 * ## The hazard, stated correctly
 *
 * ⛔ The old key — `${d.childObject}` joined to the map index — did NOT
 * collide. The index is unique among siblings by construction, so two declined
 * details keyed as `undefined-0` and `undefined-1`: distinct, no React
 * duplicate-key warning, no remount collision. Anyone re-deriving this starts
 * from the INDEX-IDENTITY hazard, never from a collision claim (objectui#6371
 * corrects the record on that point).
 *
 * The real defect: for a declined entry the DATA half of that key is
 * `undefined`, so the entry's identity was purely its POSITION — and the
 * row-state store was addressed the same way. Reordering or removing an entry
 * therefore re-associated a collection's DOM node, its rows, AND its
 * contribution to the document subtotal with a different collection.
 *
 * ## What the identity is
 *
 * A named collection is identified by the child object it lists: the half of
 * the old key that actually carried data, and the half that survives a
 * reorder. A DECLINED entry has no such half — the decline is precisely the
 * absence of one — so its identity is its AUTHORED POSITION in the incoming
 * `details` array, synthesized here, once, at config time.
 *
 * Two collections may legitimately list the SAME child object, so an
 * occurrence counter separates them without sending the named case back to
 * position. Two entries indistinguishable in the config stay indistinguishable
 * here: that ambiguity is authored, not introduced.
