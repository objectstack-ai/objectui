/**
 * objectui#7029 — the object page must not invent a calendar field binding.
 *
 * Ruled on objectstack#13748 (director batch #19, option A). This face used to
 * emit `startDateField: 'due_date'` and `titleField: 'name'` into
 * `options.calendar` for EVERY object view, declared or not. Downstream that is
 * indistinguishable from a real binding, and it is what made
 * `ObjectCalendar`'s own refusal screen ("Calendar configuration required.
 * Please specify startDateField and titleField.") unreachable from this route:
 * the renderer decides by asking whether a start-date binding is PRESENT, and
 * this face always said yes. Measured on hotcrm's `crm_leave_request` (real
 * fields `start_date` / `end_date`, no `calendar:` block): nine records piled
 * onto today's cell under titles resolved through the display-name chain.
 *
 * The exact shape objectui#3129 already gave the timeline face one branch up
 * (`timelineViewOptions`), and ADR-0085 gave the kanban lane ("never invents a
 * field the object doesn't have"), and `InterfaceListPage.defaultCalendarFromObject`
 * has always had (a binding, or `undefined` — never a guess).
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted before running, then observed:
 * restore `startDateField: viewDef.calendar?.startDateField || 'due_date'` /
 * `titleField: … || 'name'` and the "invents NO field names" cases below go RED
 * (they read the fabricated names), while the "forwards what the author
 * declared" cases stay GREEN in either world — the fabricated value is only
 * ever observable when the view declared nothing. That asymmetry is the point:
 * a fix that refused EVERY view would also pass a refusal-only test, so the
 * declared-config cases are carried here as the control.
