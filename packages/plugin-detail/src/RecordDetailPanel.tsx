/**
 * RecordDetailPanel — the record overlay's PAYLOAD, with no shell of its own.
 *
 * This is `RecordDetailDrawer`'s body lifted out of the `Sheet` it used to be
 * welded to (objectui#9299, director seat decision batch #128 item 1). The
 * ruling is that *how* a record opens — drawer / modal / split / popover — is a
 * property of the overlay shell and is honoured the same on every view type,
 * so exactly one payload is mounted through `NavigationOverlay` by all five
 * list-type renderers (`ObjectGrid`, `ObjectTree`, `ObjectGantt`,
 * `ObjectKanban`, `ObjectCalendar`).
 *
 * What lives here: the `objectSchema` -> typed-field derivation, the single
 * `InlineEditProvider` session, `DetailView`, and the record-level
 * `InlineEditSaveBar`. What does NOT live here: `Sheet`/`Dialog`/`Popover`,
 * headers, close buttons, drag-resize, width policy. All of that is the
 * shell's, and the shell is `NavigationOverlay`.
 *
 * ⚠️ Capability is HANDLER PRESENCE, not a boolean prop: a caller that omits
 * `onFieldSave` gets a strictly read-only panel (no inline editors), and one
 * that omits `onDelete` gets no delete action. That is what lets a gantt row
 * locked through `lockField` open read-only without the panel knowing what a
 * lock is.

 * the renderers no longer go through that component, so they read the constant
 * instead. ⛔ Do not re-spell the literal at a call site — four copies of a
 * ruled-on number is how the four surfaces drift apart.
 *
 * `NavigationOverlay` treats an authored width as a FLOOR
 * (`max(WIDTH, min(60vw, 880px))`), and for this value that expression reduces
