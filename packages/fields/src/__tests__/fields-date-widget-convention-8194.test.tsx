 * objectui#8194 — the four readonly `date` WIDGET faces converge onto
 * `formatDate`, following the maintainer's ruling A on objectui#7620.
 *
 * ── What was enumerated ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The card's population is defined by OMISSION — sites that render a date
 * WITHOUT an options bag — so it was re-enumerated by mechanism rather than by
 * spelling before anything was edited. Across the 78 non-test source files of
 * `@object-ui/fields` the complete set of "a Date becomes user-visible text"
 * mechanisms is: `toLocaleDateString` (7), `toLocaleTimeString` (2), the
 * shared `formatDate` / `formatDateTime` family, and nothing else — no
 * `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, no `toDateString`/`toUTCString`, no `date-fns` /
 * `dayjs` / `luxon` / `moment`. `toLocaleString` (4) is number formatting.
 *
 * That yields SIX bare no-bag sites, two more than the card's four:
 *
 *   1. `widgets/DateField.tsx`          readonly `date` widget        ← fixed
 *   2. `widgets/GridField.tsx`          sub-grid `date` column        ← fixed
 *   3. `widgets/FormulaField.tsx`       `return_type: 'date'`         ← fixed
 *   4. `widgets/lookupColumnDisplay.tsx` the `$date` fallback         ← fixed
 *   5. `widgets/DateField`'s sibling `DateTimeField.tsx` readonly     ← NOT
 *   6. `widgets/GridField.tsx`'s `datetime`/`time` branch             ← NOT
 *
 * 5 and 6 are DATETIME faces. Their one home is `formatDateTime`, which has
 * its own face vocabulary (`'compact'` from objectui#7443 versus the verbose
 * default) — picking one of those is a display-convention decision the #7620
 * ruling does not reach, so THIS card recorded them separately and left them
 * alone.
 *
 * ⚠️ That fence has since been LIFTED by a ruling of its own (objectui#8209:
 * per register, both sites through `formatDateTime`). The last describe block
 * below is what the fence became — the same verbatim copy of the former bare
 * pair, now asserting both sites have LEFT it. The face each one arrived at is
 * pinned in `datetime-widget-faces-8209.test.tsx`; the two halves together are
 * the flip, which is why neither is a witness on its own.
 *
 * ── What moved, measured in five locales ─────────────────────────────────
 * `en-US`, for the SAME ISO date-only value:
 *
 * | path                                   | current year | past year     |
 * | -------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
 * | `date` field CELL (-> `formatDate`)    | `Jul 4`      | `Jul 4, 2024` |
 * | the four widgets, BEFORE (no bag)      | `7/4/2026`   | `7/4/2024`    |
 * | the four widgets, AFTER (this PR)      | `Jul 4`      | `Jul 4, 2024` |
 *
 * ⚠️ This is a BIGGER move than objectui#7620's, and the difference is the one
 * thing about this card a reviewer should look at twice. #7620's former face
 * already asked for `{ year, month: 'short', day }`, so only the YEAR token
 * moved and its past-year row was byte-identical. These four passed NO bag at
 * all, i.e. `Intl`'s numeric default, so the WHOLE face changes and BOTH rows
 * move, in every locale — `4.7.2026` becomes `4. Juli`, `2026/7/4` becomes
 * `7月4日`, and the `ar` numeric form becomes `4 يوليو`. There is no
 * must-not-change row here, which is why `FIXTURE VALIDITY` below asserts the
 * disagreement in BOTH years rather than agreement in one.
 *
 * ── Directions ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Reverting any of the four sites to its bare `toLocaleDateString(locale)`
 * turns EVERY case in the first three describe blocks RED — both years, all
 * five locales — because `FORMER_FACE` below is that removed spelling copied
 * verbatim and every case asserts the render differs from it and equals the
 * shared function. `FIXTURE VALIDITY` is green on both sides by construction:
 * it measures the two formatters against each other, never the widgets, and
 * exists so a fixture that silently stopped exercising the fork fails loudly
 * instead of passing for free. The `en` literals are what stops a silent
 * redesign of `formatDate`'s default face from sliding through with the
 * shared-function comparisons still agreeing.
