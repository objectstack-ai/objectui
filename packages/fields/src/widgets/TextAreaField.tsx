/**
 * TextAreaField - Multi-line text input widget
 * Supports configurable row count and preserves whitespace in readonly mode.
 *
 * Mobile UX (round 3): when the FIELD METADATA carries `mobile_fullscreen:
 * true`, an "expand" affordance opens a fullscreen edit dialog — much easier
 * on phones than tapping a 4-row textarea trapped between other fields.
 *
 * That flag has exactly one producer: `ObjectForm` stamps it onto every
 * long-text field when `ObjectFormSchema.mobile.fullscreenLongText` is set
 * (`plugin-form/src/ObjectForm.tsx`). It reaches this widget on `field` — the
 * single metadata carrier since objectui#3233. A `SchemaRenderer`-hosted node
 * arrives there too: the registry adapter (`withFieldCarrier`) maps the SDUI
 * `schema` node onto `field` before the widget sees it.
 *
 * The affordance, the dialog and the draft/commit semantics live in the shared
 * `FullscreenFieldEditor` — the same producer stamps the same flag on
 * rich-text fields, and `RichTextField` renders it from there too
 * (objectui#3301). Only the EDITOR differs per widget; here it is a
 * full-height `Textarea`.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO widget-prop override. A `mobileFullscreen`
 * (camelCase) prop was read here and written by nobody in the repo, and the
 * snake_case `mobile_fullscreen` prop cannot arrive either: the form renderer
 * strips both `mobile_fullscreen` and `fullscreen` from the props it forwards
 * to registered widgets (`stripRegisteredFieldProps` in
 * `components/src/renderers/form/form.tsx`). Reading keys nobody produces
 * documented a contract that never held and invited the next author to pass a
 * silently-ignored prop, so the reads are gone (objectui#3232). If a host
 * override is ever genuinely needed, declare ONE key on
 * `FieldWidgetComponentProps`, stop stripping it, and have a host pass it.
 *
 * ## The character counter (objectui#3408, shared across surfaces in #3417)
 *
 * Both editing surfaces below — the inline `<Textarea>` and the fullscreen
 * dialog's — render the SAME `CharacterCount`. It lives in
 * `@object-ui/components` since objectui#3439, hoisted there so the form
 * renderer's built-in `textarea` branch renders that very component too rather
 * than growing a third copy; this widget's use of it is unchanged. It owns the
 * three-node
 * GOV.UK shape (decorative digits / accessible description / gated status
 * region) and the debounce and threshold behind it. Until #3417 the fullscreen
 * footer had its own hand-written copy that was digits and nothing else, which
 * is what a second copy of a UI always costs: it drifts, and nothing reports
 * the drift.
 *
 * This widget's remaining job is the part only it can do — mint the two
 * description ids and name each one in the `aria-describedby` of the control
 * it describes. The surfaces differ in exactly one behaviour, and it is
 * declared rather than implied: `announceNearLimit`. Inline announces
 * (unchanged since #3408); the fullscreen dialog does not.
