/**
 * The STRICT AUTHORING FACE — a derived, unknown-key-closing twin of the node
 * face (objectui#8345, under the objectui#5250 ruling: maintainer 2026-09-04,
 * decision batch #25, option 2 — "each node schema gets a derived strict
 * variant; `objectui validate` and the doc-snippet gates run strict; renderer
 * props keep the tolerant face unchanged").
 *
 * ## What this is, and what it deliberately is NOT
 *
 * It is a SECOND face over the SAME declarations. `BaseSchemaCore` stays
 * `.passthrough()` and every published mirror keeps the accept set it has: this
 * module adds a face, it does not change the existing one. Nothing in this
 * repository consumes it yet — wiring `objectui validate`, the JSON-fence gate
 * and `objectui check` is the devx half of the ruling and is ruled to come
 * after, so the only consumer of these exports today is the pin file that
 * measures them.
 *
 * It is DERIVED, never hand-written. A second hand-maintained copy of the 107
 * component schemas would be a parity ledger nobody can keep honest — this
 * repository already carries the bill for that shape (objectui#6058, #6152,
 * #7759). Everything below walks the mirrors that already exist.
 *
 * It is a RUNTIME face only. `deriveStrictAuthoringSchema` returns the same
 * TypeScript type it was given, because strictness here is a property of the
 * parse and not of the declaration — a document that type-checks against
 * `SchemaNode` still type-checks. The TypeScript authoring face is a separate
 * card with a separate ruling (objectui#7927).
 *
 * ## Why objects are CLONED and not rebuilt
 *
 * Every object is cloned by patching a copy of its own `_zod.def` and calling
 * its own constructor. ⛔ Never rebuild one with `z.object(shape)`: that
 * spelling keeps the shape and DROPS `def.checks`, so every `.refine()` and
 * `.superRefine()` on the way down is silently lost and the twin UNDER-reports
 * red — a strict face that quietly stopped enforcing a refinement is worse than
 * no strict face, because it reads as evidence. The pin file holds a control
 * that shows the rebuild spelling losing a real check.
 *
 * ## What strict cannot close, stated as the complete list
 *
 * Opaque validators — `custom`, `function` and `transform` — have no shape
 * inside them to close, so the walker returns them untouched and REPORTS them
 * through `onOpaqueShape`. That is the whole limit list, not a sample of it,
 * and the pin file re-derives it rather than quoting this sentence.
 *
 * One further limit is worth naming because it is invisible in the shape: a
 * check installed with `.superRefine()` is a CLOSURE, and a closure that
 * consults another schema keeps consulting the TOLERANT one. The live instance
 * is the `chatbot` body clause in `defineNodeComponentUnion` — it is preserved
 * by the clone and still fires, but the schema it defers to inside is the
 * tolerant `BaseSchemaCore.shape.body`. That direction is conservative: such a
 * check can only ADD refusals, never accept something the strict shape refused.
 *
 * ## The recursion point, and why this card waited for it
 *
 * A child slot is `z.union([SchemaNodeSchema, z.array(SchemaNodeSchema)])`, and
 * since objectui#8344 `SchemaNodeSchema`'s component arm IS the component union
 * rather than the ~21 base keys. Strict-ifying the OLD recursion point measured
 * the recursion point instead of the components — every child node's own
 * declared props read as unrecognised. That is the order-of-magnitude error
 * objectui#7935 exists to prevent, and it is why the derivation below can now
 * run over the whole tree with no boundary at all.

 *
 * They were three near-identical local copies of what the import boundary
 * already had, and the copy is how they drifted: objectui#9086 taught the
 * boundary's `cloneWithDef` to carry a node's registry metadata, this file's
 * copy was deliberately not widened at the time, and objectui#9102 measured
 * what that cost — `deriveStrictAuthoringSchema` rebuilds every container it
 * walks, so every description this repository's own mirrors declare was
 * dropped from the derived twin, and any `title` or `externalVocabulary` on an
 * imported subtree with it.
 *
 * ⛔ A local re-spelling is the defect, not the fix. The metadata carry is
 * invisible at the call site — a derived node with no description parses
 * identically to one with — so a second copy loses it again with no symptom.
 * `__tests__/registry-meta-carry-9102.test.ts` measures both faces through the
 * one helper.
 *
 * ⚠️ What is NOT shared: the arms. This walker closes objects with
 * `catchall: z.never()` and reports opaque shapes; the boundary strips defaults
 * and holds an identity property this face deliberately does not have (it
 * rebuilds unconditionally, because "strict" is a property every node must
 * acquire). Only the three primitives above are common, and only they moved.
