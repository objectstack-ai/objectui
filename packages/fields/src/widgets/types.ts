/**
 * DOM pass-through: what a widget's `...props` spread may legitimately put on

 *
 * A NAMED type rather than an inline block of {@link FieldWidgetComponentProps}
 * so the compiler can bind it to its runtime executor in BOTH directions
 * (objectui#3291). `toDomProps` asserts:
 *
 *  - every key it forwards is declared on the widget contract — deleting one
 *    here without deleting it there is a compile error;
 *  - every key of THIS type is one it forwards — adding one here without
 *    adding it to `DOM_PASS_THROUGH_KEYS` is a compile error too.
 *
 * The second direction is the one that matters for the failure mode this repo
 * treats as first-class: DECLARED BUT NOT DELIVERED (objectui#3290's
 * `aria-required` that never reached a control, objectui#3222's validation slot
 * nobody produced). Without it, a key added here would type-check, read as
 * supported, and silently never reach the DOM — and the leak test cannot see
 * that class of bug, because it looks for attributes that ARRIVE, not for ones
 * that go missing.
 *
 * `className` and `disabled` are deliberately NOT here. They are DOM-legal and
 * `toDomProps` does forward them, but they are declared on the controlled-input
 * block of {@link FieldWidgetComponentProps} because widgets also INTERPRET
 * them (className is composed with the widget's own classes; disabled is OR-ed
 * with readonly). They are therefore bound in the forward direction only.
 *
 * `AriaAttributes` and the `data-${string}` family are matched by prefix at
 * runtime rather than key-by-key, so they are intersected in separately.
 *
 * Adding a key here is a contract change: say who produces it and who reads it.

/**
 * Props every field widget in this package receives at RUNTIME.
 *
 * Named `FieldWidgetComponentProps`, not `FieldWidgetProps` (objectui#3161,
 * objectstack#4115 ledger batch 7), adopting the name `@object-ui/app-shell`
 * settled on for the same split in objectui#3169: `@objectstack/spec/ui` owns
 * `FieldWidgetProps` for the DECLARED widget-plugin contract — a zod object
 * (`FieldWidgetPropsSchema`) a plugin manifest is validated against, with
 * `field` narrowed to `{ name?, label?, type: <the FieldType enum> }` and
 * `readonly` / `required` carrying `.default()`s. This is the React interface
 * the widgets in this directory actually implement, against
 * `@object-ui/types`'s much richer `FieldMetadata`.
 *
 * The two are NOT interchangeable, but they no longer disagree on the
 * validation slot: this type used to call it `errorMessage` while the spec
 * calls it `error`, so a widget written to the published contract read
 * `undefined` forever. objectui#3222 resolved that in the direction the
 * contract points — the slot below IS the spec's `error`, and the form
 * renderer now produces it (see `error`'s own doc comment). Reading
 * `props.required` off this type is still a compile error rather than a
 * silent `any`; that key is deliberately NOT lowered here (see below).
 *
 * ## Why `required` is still absent, though the spec declares it
 *
 * The required MARKER is drawn exactly once, by the form renderer's
 * `<FormLabel>` (the `*` with `aria-label="required"`, which the label
 * association folds into the control's accessible name). Handing `required`
 * to widgets would give that marker a second possible author, and the very
 * next AI-written widget draws its own asterisk — the same double-display
 * failure that keeps the validation TEXT out of the widget below. The a11y
 * state a widget genuinely could carry is `aria-required` on the input, and
 * that needs no new key at all: `AriaAttributes` is already part of this type
 * and every widget already forwards it to its control. Tracked separately;
 * do not add `required` here to "align" without that decision.
 *
 * ## Why there is no `[key: string]: any` (objectui#3221)
 *
 * This type used to end in an index signature, "load-bearing" for the widgets'
 * `...props` spreads. It was also why every drift above was invisible: **a type
 * that claims to have every key can never be reported as missing one** (the
 * objectstack#4075 mechanism). `props.required` and `props.error` were legal
 * reads typed `any` and always `undefined` at runtime; a misspelled prop
 * (`readOnly` for `readonly`, `onchange` for `onChange`) compiled; and any
 * structural/parity comparison against the type was useless *in principle*,
 * which is why the batch-7 symbol guard was the only detector that could see
 * the collision at all.
 *
 * It is replaced by the CLOSED set below: the controlled-input contract, the
 * host plumbing the form renderer genuinely forwards, and a DOM pass-through
 * allowance. `data-*` is an open family by design (it is open in HTML too) and
 * is expressed as a template-literal index signature, which — unlike
 * `[key: string]` — leaves `keyof` finite, so an undeclared prop still fails.
 *
 * ## Why there is no `schema` (objectui#3233)
 *
 * `schema` used to be declared here as a SECOND carrier for what `field`
 * already means — `SchemaRenderer` handed the SDUI node down as `schema`, the
 * form renderer forwarded `schema={props.field || props.schema || props}`
 * *alongside* `field`, and ~30 widgets resolved their config as
 * `field || schema`. One concept, two keys, two producers: exactly the
 * consumer-side tolerance AGENTS.md #0.1 forbids, and exactly the shape that
 * lets an AI-written widget pick the wrong spelling and still "work" under one
 * host while reading `undefined` under another.
 *
 * v17 converged it at the PRODUCERS. `field` is the only carrier a widget ever
 * sees; the SDUI node → `field` translation happens once, in this package's
 * registry adapter (`withFieldCarrier`), not ~30 times in the widgets. Reading
 * `props.schema` is now a compile error rather than a silent second contract.
 *
 * Adding a key here is a contract change: say who produces it and who reads it.
