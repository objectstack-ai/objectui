/**
 * `$icontains` lowers, and the two faces of the `$` dialect agree about it
 * (objectui#8976).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `$icontains` is a canonical member of `@objectstack/spec`'s
 * `FILTER_OPERATORS`; `ValueDataSource` executes it; `FilterConditionField`
 * emits it for the `containsCaseInsensitive` builder row; and
 * `packages/core/src/adapters/README.md` PRESCRIBES it as the repair for
 * `$like` / `$ilike` / `$regex`. `convertOperatorToAST` had no row for it, so
 * `convertFiltersToAST` refused it with the generic unknown-operator paragraph
 * — an `INVALID_FILTER` / 400 on a spelling this repo tells authors to write.
 *
 * That is the OPPOSITE leg of objectui#8568, which retired four lowercase
 * aliases the converter accepted and the matcher refused. There the converter
 * was more tolerant than the contract; here it was less tolerant than the
 * contract. ⛔ The two are not one change: making the acceptance sets "agree"
 * in a single sweep would have widened the matcher instead.
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and why in this shape
 *
 * The weak version of this file would be `expect(convertOperatorToAST('$icontains'))
 * .not.toBeNull()` — true the moment a row is added, and blind to whether the
 * row means anything. Three stronger claims are made instead.
 *
 *   1. **The spelling the adapters README PRESCRIBES must work.** The
 *      prescriptions are read out of that page's refusal table and intersected
 *      with the spec's `FILTER_OPERATORS`, so the population comes from prose a
 *      human wrote and from the contract — never from the function under test.
 *      This is the claim that fails if the converter is repaired but the page
 *      keeps prescribing something else, and the claim that would have failed
 *      before this card in the way an author actually meets the bug.
 *   2. **Both faces answer the same rows.** `convertFiltersToAST` and
 *      `ValueDataSource` are probed over one fixture, with a case-SENSITIVE
 *      control (`$contains`) that must select a strictly smaller set. Without
 *      that control "both select rows" would pass on a matcher that ignored the
 *      case fold entirely.
 *   3. **`icontains` survives to the AST unchanged.** The lowered operator must
 *      be a member of the spec's `VALID_AST_OPERATORS` — the set that gates
 *      `isFilterAST()`, and therefore the difference between a filter the wire
 *      carries and one `driver-sql` silently DROPS (objectstack#3948).
 *
 * ⚠️ Deliberately NOT claimed: end-to-end reach from a stored `criteria_json`
 * into this converter. The criteria store is not in this tree — the
 * consumer-local caveat objectui#6839 established. What is provable here, and
 * all this file asserts, is the acceptance-set disagreement and the producer
 * arm.
