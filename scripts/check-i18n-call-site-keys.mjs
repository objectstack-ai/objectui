/**
 * Every key a component asks `t()` for must EXIST in the `en` locale pack — and
 * where the call site also writes an inline `defaultValue`, that dead string
 * must say the same thing the pack does (objectui#3810) — and the interpolation
 * arguments the call site passes must be exactly the holes the `en` value has
 * to receive them (objectui#3845) — and the OTHER spelling of a fallback,
 * `t(key) || 'English'`, must not exist at all (objectui#4117) — and whatever
 * text that inline default carries must spell its placeholders the one way the
 * provider-less fallback can resolve them (objectui#4905) — and the SAME
 * promise written one indirection away, in a `createSafeTranslation` defaults
 * table, must say the same thing the pack does too (objectui#7567).
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs   (also `pnpm check:i18n-keys`)
 * Exit: 0 = every in-scope call-site key resolves (or is baselined), no inline
 *           default contradicts its `en` value, no `createSafeTranslation`
 *           defaults row contradicts it either, no call site's option names
 *           disagree with its `en` value's holes, and no call site carries a
 *           literal sibling fallback, 1 = otherwise
 *
 * ## The gap this closes (objectui#3530)
 *
 * `packages/i18n/src/__tests__/all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` asserts that every
 * pack defines every `en` key and no pack defines a key `en` lacks — a **pack vs
 * pack** invariant. It is blind by construction to the other direction: a key a
 * component *references* that NO pack defines. Ten packs identically missing a
 * key is full parity, and full parity is green.
 *
 * Nothing else caught it either, because `fallbackLng: 'en'` plus an inline
 * `t(key, { defaultValue: 'English text' })` renders correct English at the one
 * call site while the key stays untranslatable in all ten languages. The
 * dev-only missing-key warner (`i18n.ts`) is the only runtime signal and CI
 * never sees a browser console. objectui#3517 was one instance —
 * `form.createTargetOrg`, missing from all ten packs, covered by an inline
 * default for months, found only by #3469's by-hand per-key sweep. This gate is
 * the class, not the instance: the first full run over `main` found
 * 258 more.
 *
 * ## Division of labour with the other two i18n gates
 *
 * All three read the same ten packs, and each is blind to what the next owns:
 *
 *   - THIS gate: call site -> `en`. Does the key a component asks for exist, and
 *     does the call site's own inline `defaultValue` agree with the `en` value?
 *     Both directions of one question — what this call site will render.
 *   - `packages/i18n/src/__tests__/all-locales-key-parity.test.ts`: pack vs pack
 *     KEY SETS, plus placeholder shape. Never reads a value.
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` (objectui#3650): `en` vs the other nine
 *     packs, as an event — when an `en` string CHANGES, the nine translations
 *     must change in the same PR (or be waived). Neither pack gate can see a
 *     value go stale: objectui#3582 and objectui#3625 were eight packs serving a
 *     retired sentence at full key parity, the second one in idiomatic native
 *     script that every value-shaped heuristic also reads as healthy.
 *
 * The `default-value-drift` class below is the fourth blind spot in that
 * partition, and it was blind to all three by construction (objectui#3810):
 * this gate asked only whether the key existed, parity reads no values at all,
 * and en-drift fires on CHANGE — and in every one of the 43 sites the `en` value
 * had not moved for months. The call site was the thing that disagreed.
 *
 * `interpolation-parity` is the fifth, and it is blind to all four
 * (objectui#3845). Parity DOES compare placeholder shape — but pack against
 * pack: the nine translations must hold the same `{{holes}}` as `en`. Ten packs
 * agreeing on `Update` while the call site passes `version` is full placeholder
 * parity, because no pack gate ever reads the argument list. And a `defaultValue`
 * that agrees byte for byte with `en` says nothing about the arguments either:
 * `home.welcome` passed `product` to `Welcome to {{product}}`, the `en` value was
 * later rewritten to `Build your business system with AI`, and #3810's rule is
 * satisfied the moment the call site copies that new sentence — with the now
 * inert `product` still sitting beside it.
 *
 * ## What is IN scope, and why the answer is not "every `t(`"
 *
 * A naive grep for `t('...')` scores 3485 call sites in this repo and would be
 * wrong about roughly a third of them, because `t` is not one function:
 *
 *   - 2370 calls reach i18next and therefore the locale packs. Those are the
 *     subject of this gate.
 *   - 1074 calls go to `packages/app-shell/src/views/metadata-admin/i18n.ts`, a
 *     module-local `engine.*` label table that is NOT an i18next pack and never
 *     will be (read its header). Checking its keys against `en` produces 89
 *     permanent false reds — measured, by removing the exclusion.
 *   - 41 calls are a local `t` that is not a translator at all — a `useCallback`
 *     result, a `Date` difference, a `||` chain, a `.t()` method on some other
 *     object.
 *
 * So the unit of classification is the **binding**, not the spelling. For each
 * `t(...)`/`tt(...)` call this file resolves which declaration of `t` is in
 * scope at that position (nearest enclosing scope wins, then the latest
 * declaration before the use), and classifies it:
 *
 *   PACK   — bound from a call to a translate hook: `const { t } = useXxx…()`,
 *            `const tt = useSafeTranslate()`. The hook-name convention is
 *            `use*Translation` / `use*Translate` / `use*T` and it is a real
 *            repo-wide convention: all 26 such hooks are either
 *            `createSafeTranslation(...)` factories or thin wrappers over
 *            `useObjectTranslation`. **Checked.**
 *   LOCAL  — bound from an `import` of a module in EXCLUDED_TRANSLATORS below,
 *            or forwarded inside that module's declared scope. **Skipped**, by
 *            declaration, with a reason. An import from any *other* module is a
 *            hard error, so a second local table cannot appear silently.
 *   OTHER  — anything else (`const t = someValue`). **Skipped**, counted.
 *
 * A `t` received as a parameter or a prop inherits its file's provenance: a
 * helper that takes `t: TranslateFn` is checked in a file whose own `t` comes
 * from a hook, and skipped inside the metadata-admin tree. That hop is the one
 * place a type checker would be exact and this parser is a heuristic, so it is
 * worth knowing what it buys: deleting `forwardedScope` puts 89 call sites
 * (78 distinct `engine.*`/`perm.cel.*`/`perm.rls.*` keys) back on the report,
 * every one of them a component that was handed the metadata-admin table's `t`
 * by its parent, and not one of them a real finding.
 *
 * `dead-sibling-fallback` is the sixth, and it was blind to all five — including
 * the two that read values — for one syntactic reason (objectui#4117): every
 * rule above reads the call's ARGUMENTS, and this fallback is not an argument.
 * `t('marketplace.detail.moreOptions') || 'More options'` carries no options
 * object at all, so class 3 sees no `defaultValue` to compare and class 4 sees
 * an empty (and correct) argument set. The dead English sits one operator to the
 * right of everything this file used to look at. `node.parent` is what closes
 * it, and the rule is the class rather than the instance: the first full run
 * found 24 such sites in four files, every one of them on a key `en` defines.
 *
 * ## Eight failure classes
 *
 * (The heading said "Five" while the list below held seven — a stale count
 * corrected here rather than left to grow by one more.)
 *
 * 1. `missing-key` — a literal key with no leaf in `en`. i18next plural suffixes
 *    (`_one`, `_other`, …) count as defining the base key, and a key passed with
 *    `returnObjects: true` may name a subtree rather than a leaf.
 * 2. `missing-prefix` — a template key (`` t(`marketplace.category.${c}`) ``)
 *    whose static head matches NO `en` key at all. Then every possible expansion
 *    is missing, whatever the substitution evaluates to. This is the only claim
 *    about a dynamic key that is true without knowing the value.
 * 3. `default-value-drift` (objectui#3810) — the key EXISTS and the call site
 *    still carries a literal `t(key, { defaultValue: 'other English' })` whose
 *    text differs from the `en` value. i18next uses `defaultValue` only on a
 *    miss, so with the key present the pack always wins and that string is
 *    structurally dead code — dead code that states, at the call site, a
 *    different sentence from the one users read. Two costs, both measured on
 *    `main`: the reader (and the AI writing the next edit) is misled —
 *    `ForgotPasswordPage` claimed `If an account exists, a reset link has been
 *    sent.` while the pack asserts `We've sent a password reset link to
 *    {{email}}.`, a materially different privacy claim — and on the day the key
 *    is renamed or dropped, rendering silently falls back to that other
 *    sentence, in a diff where nobody expected copy to change.
 *
 *    Classes 1 and 3 are disjoint by construction: drift is judged only when the
 *    key resolves to an `en` leaf this file could read as a string, so a call
 *    site is never reported twice, and each report reads on its own. Deliberately
 *    NOT judged (counted instead): a computed default (`defaultValue: label`), a
 *    call whose key is dynamic or denotes several literals, a `returnObjects`
 *    subtree, and the plural families — `t('detail.showEmptyRelated')` resolves
 *    through `_one`/`_other`, and there is no single form to compare against.
 *
 *    The rule is HARD from day one — no baseline section, unlike classes 1-2.
 *    That is a measurement, not an aspiration: the first full run found 43 sites
 *    in 19 files, all of them aligned in the same PR (objectui#3810), so there
 *    is no debt for a ratchet to hold. A `defaultValue` written on a key that is
 *    NOT yet in `en` stays legal — that transition period runs for months
 *    (objectui#3546) and is class 1's business, not this one's.
 *
 * 4. `interpolation-parity` (objectui#3845) — the key EXISTS, and the set of
 *    interpolation option names the call site passes is not the set of `{{hole}}`
 *    names the `en` value has. Both directions fail, because the declaration and
 *    the thing that consumes it are the same statement read from two ends:
 *
 *      - **inert** — an argument passed with no hole to receive it. i18next
 *        drops it silently, so the author's intent evaporates with no runtime
 *        signal at all: `marketplace.action.updateTo` passed `version` to a value
 *        reading `Update`, while its sister key three hundred lines down renders
 *        `Update → v{{version}}` from the same variable. Nothing is broken today,
 *        which is exactly why nothing ever noticed.
 *      - **unfilled** — a hole with no argument to fill it. i18next leaves the
 *        braces in the output, so the user reads a literal `{{name}}`. This
 *        direction measured 0 on `main` when the rule landed; keeping it judged
 *        is the difference between "0 by luck" and "0 by guarantee".
 *
 *    Deliberately NOT judged (counted instead), and each abstention is a
 *    decision:
 *
 *      - The same key preconditions as class 3 — a dynamic or several-literal
 *        key, a `returnObjects` subtree, an `en` leaf that is not a readable
 *        static string. Plural families fall out here too: `t(k, { count })`
 *        resolves through `_one`/`_other` and there is no single value whose
 *        holes could be the answer, so the families are never judged.
 *      - An options object whose NAME SET cannot be read: a spread, a computed
 *        name, a getter — or a `replace:` redirect, which is where i18next takes
 *        the interpolation data from when it is present, making the top-level
 *        names not interpolation at all. Today the repo has none of these; the
 *        abstention is what stops the first one becoming a false red.
 *      - RESERVED names are removed from the call site's own option names ONLY
 *        when judging **inert**, and kept for **unfilled** (objectui#4206).
 *        `count` is the reason both directions need a different answer: it is
 *        an i18next control option AND the value of a `{{count}}` hole, so
 *        dropping it before judging `inert` keeps a passed `count` from
 *        reading as an inert argument, while KEEPING it for `unfilled` lets
 *        the rule tell "passed `count`" apart from "passed nothing" and still
 *        catch a real `{{count}}` miss (objectui#4157) — dropping it from both
 *        directions, as the rule did before #4206, made `unfilled`
 *        structurally unable to ever contain `count`, whether filled or not.
 *
 *    Nested `t()` inside the options object is not a special case here and must
 *    not become one: the arguments of an inner call are not properties of the
 *    outer object literal, so an AST reading the outer literal's own properties
 *    never sees them. It is called out because the census that found this class
 *    was done with a regex first, and the regex read the inner `index:` of
 *    `packages/fields/src/widgets/ImageField.tsx` as an argument of the outer
 *    `fields.image.enlarge` call — one false positive out of two hits. The
 *    self-test pins the AST's behaviour on exactly that shape.
 *
 *    Also HARD from day one, and for the same reason: the first full run found
 *    2 inert sites and 0 unfilled ones, both fixed in objectui#3845's PR by
 *    DELETING the dead argument. Adding the hole to the `en` value instead is a
 *    product decision about what the string should say — it changes what users
 *    read and obliges the nine other packs through objectui#3650 — so the gate
 *    accepts either resolution and neither is its to make.
 *
 * 5. `dead-sibling-fallback` (objectui#4117) — the key EXISTS and the call site
 *    still writes a literal fallback as the call's SIBLING rather than as an
 *    argument: `t('detail.moreOptions') || 'More options'`, or the same with
 *    `??`. Unlike class 3 this rule does not ask what the fallback SAYS. It is
 *    existence-is-red, and the fix is DELETION, because there is no reading of
 *    this spelling under which the right operand can render:
 *
 *      - With a provider, i18next serves the pack value — the same reason class
 *        3's `defaultValue` is dead.
 *      - With NO provider, this spelling is strictly worse than `defaultValue`
 *        rather than equivalent to it. react-i18next's not-ready `t` returns the
 *        KEY, and `createSafeTranslation`'s fallback returns `defaults[key] ||
 *        key` — both truthy — so `||` skips the right operand and the user reads
 *        a raw `console.objectView.delete`. `defaultValue` at least renders
 *        English there. Same family as objectui#3865; this is its `||` half.
 *
 *    So the two spellings are not two ways to write one thing: one is dead and
 *    misleading, the other is dead and misleading AND cannot degrade gracefully.
 *    The ruling on this card keeps ONE blessed fallback spelling — `defaultValue`,
 *    governed by class 3 — instead of two competing ones, which is also why this
 *    rule does not simply extend class 3's byte-equality test to the sibling
 *    position: aligning these strings would bless the spelling.
 *
 *    Deliberately NOT judged (counted instead), and each abstention is a
 *    decision the class above would get wrong:
 *
 *      - The same key preconditions as classes 3 and 4 — a dynamic or
 *        several-literal key, a `returnObjects` subtree, an `en` leaf that is
 *        not a readable static string (the plural families land here).
 *      - An `en` value that is the EMPTY STRING. Then `t()` really can return a
 *        falsy value and `||` really can reach its right operand, so the premise
 *        of the whole class fails. `en` has no such leaf today; the abstention is
 *        what stops the first one becoming a wrong red.
 *      - A NON-LITERAL right operand (`t(key) || label`). What renders is then a
 *        runtime value, not a second copy of the sentence, and judging it would
 *        mean claiming something about a variable this parser cannot read —
 *        exactly how class 3 treats a computed `defaultValue`.
 *      - An OPTIONAL call, `t?.(key) ?? 'English'`. This one is not a parser
 *        limitation but a live path: where `t` is an optional prop, the call
 *        evaluates to `undefined` whenever the prop is absent and the fallback
 *        is what renders. Both of `packages/app-shell/src/layout/
 *        ContextSelectors.tsx`'s sites are this shape, and its own
 *        `ContextSelectors.persist.test.tsx` renders the hook with no `t` — so
 *        deleting those two would have replaced a rendered placeholder with
 *        `undefined`. The card that filed this class listed them among the 24;
 *        measuring the call shape is what took them back out.
 *
 *    Only the LEFT operand position is judged. `someLabel || t('common.actions')`
 *    is the healthy, opposite shape — a runtime value with a translated fallback
 *    — and `main` has 94 of them against these 24. A rule that read "appears in a
 *    `||`" rather than "is the left operand of one" would condemn all 94.
 *
 *    HARD from day one, like classes 3 and 4: the first full run found 24 sites,
 *    22 of them judged and deleted in objectui#4117's own PR, so there is no debt
 *    for a ratchet to hold. And a fallback written on a key `en` does NOT define
 *    stays legal — that is class 1's business, not this one's.
 *
 * 6. `missing-member` (objectui#4964) — the template family's HEAD resolves, so
 *    class 2 is satisfied, and a specific MEMBER of the vocabulary the call site
 *    iterates has no leaf in `en`. This is the sixth blind spot and it was blind
 *    to all five, plus to both other i18n gates, by construction: class 2 says in
 *    its own words that the prefix is "the only claim about a dynamic key that is
 *    true without knowing the value", parity compares ten packs that are missing
 *    it identically (full parity, green), and en-drift fires on a value CHANGING,
 *    which a key that was never added never does. `filterBuilder.operators` was
 *    the measured instance: six of its twenty-two operators were missing from all
 *    ten packs while the head resolved sixteen members deep, and users read
 *    `filterBuilder.operators.isNull` in the operator dropdown (fixed in
 *    objectui#4962, which pinned that ONE family; this class is the generalisation).
 *
 *    Knowing the members is a DECISION, not a measurement, so it is declared
 *    rather than inferred — see DYNAMIC_KEY_FAMILIES below for the registry, the
 *    six vocabulary shapes it can read, and the four reasons a family may declare
 *    that it has no static member set. Three ratchet rules keep the registry
 *    honest in both directions (`undeclared-dynamic-family`,
 *    `stale-dynamic-family`) and stop it going vacuous
 *    (`empty-vocabulary`/`unreadable-vocabulary` — a vocabulary that resolves to
 *    nothing reads exactly like one that passes).
 *
 *    Baselined like classes 1 and 2, in `missingMembers`, and for the same
 *    reason: the first full run found real debt (2 members over 25 families and
 *    112 checked member keys), and a missing translation is a gap to surface, not
 *    something to invent pack entries for.
 *
 * 7. `unresolvable-default-spelling` (objectui#4905) — an inline `defaultValue`
 *    spells a placeholder in one of the four dialects i18next accepts and
 *    `createSafeTranslation`'s `fallbackT` does not (`{{ name }}`,
 *    `{{count, number}}`, `{{- name}}`, `$t(key)`). WITH a provider the pack
 *    value wins and nothing is visible; WITHOUT one the braces reach the user.
 *
 *    This is objectui#3512's rule, and the reason it is HERE rather than there
 *    is the whole of objectui#4905. That card gated the three copy TABLE
 *    surfaces and left inline defaults out in writing, because a `defaultValue`
 *    is a call-site OPTION rather than a table: finding one means resolving
 *    which `t` is in scope at that position and reading the call's arguments —
 *    the classifier this file already is, and a second independently-rotting
 *    copy of it anywhere else. The residue #3512 recorded was 3 "not
 *    comparable" plus 62 computed inline defaults with no transitive pin.
 *
 *    Closing that residue at the SOURCE — rewriting a computed default as the
 *    `en` value so class 3 pins it — turns out to reach only 5 of the 66 sites
 *    measured on this tree, and the reason is worth stating because it is the
 *    opposite of what the card assumed. THREE things can render an inline
 *    default, and only two of them interpolate it:
 *
 *      1. i18next, with a provider. It interpolates — but the pack value wins,
 *         so the default never renders at all. Moot.
 *      2. `createSafeTranslation`'s `fallbackT`. It interpolates, with the exact
 *         literal needle this class is named for. SAFE to rewrite.
 *      3. react-i18next's not-ready `t`, which is what a bare
 *         `useObjectTranslation()` yields when no i18next instance is
 *         initialised. Measured in `react-i18next/dist/es/useTranslation.js`:
 *         `notReadyT` returns `options.defaultValue` VERBATIM — it does not
 *         interpolate at all.
 *
 *    So at a `useObjectTranslation` call site, a default written as
 *    `` `Signed in as ${user.email}` `` is not an unpinned near-miss to be
 *    tidied into `'Signed in as {{email}}'` — the template literal is the only
 *    one of the two that renders correctly there, and "fixing" it would put
 *    literal braces in front of a user on exactly the provider-less host this
 *    whole family of cards is about. `objectBulkActionDispatch.test.tsx` fails
 *    on precisely that substitution, which is how it was found.
 *
 *    Hence only 5 rewrites: four whose default carries no hole (nothing to
 *    interpolate, so all three renderers agree) and one behind a
 *    `createSafeTranslation` hook. The rest stay computed, and this class is
 *    what covers them.
 *
 *    Judged over EVERY inline default, not just the residue. A pinned default is
 *    byte-equal to an `en` value #3512 already holds to this rule, so those
 *    verdicts are green twice over — which is the point: it makes the judged
 *    count a live control (hundreds, guarded), instead of a rule whose whole
 *    subject is three strings that could silently become zero. HARD from day
 *    one, like classes 3-5: the first full run found 0 violations, so there is
 *    no debt for a ratchet to hold, and 0 stops being luck.
 *
 * 8. `factory-default-drift` (objectui#7567) — the same promise as class 3, one
 *    indirection away, and it was blind to all seven for exactly that reason.
 *    Class 3 reads the call's ARGUMENTS, so it sees `t(key, { defaultValue })`
 *    and nothing else; a `createSafeTranslation(DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS, …)` row
 *    carries the identical string with no argument anywhere near the call site.
 *    Before this class the gate classified those hooks as pack-backed, checked
 *    every key they were asked for, and never once read the table they fall back
 *    to.
 *
 *    THE DIRECTION IS NOT A CHOICE HERE, and stating it is half the class. Read
 *    `packages/i18n/src/useSafeTranslation.ts`: `fallbackT` resolves
 *    `defaults[key] || defaultValue || key`, and its own comment calls the table
 *    "the pack value's stand-in here … it takes the pack's position in i18next's
 *    own order". So a row that differs from `en` is not a second opinion, it is
 *    the SAME control labelled one way on a provider-less host and another in
 *    the console — objectui#7454's measured instance, where a calendar lane read
 *    `all-day` standalone and `All Day` in the app, plus a ternary kept
 *    structurally unreachable by nothing. The pack wins, for the same reason it
 *    wins in class 3: it is what essentially all traffic renders and what the
 *    nine other packs were translated from.
 *
 *    Not a new rule so much as a generalisation of one that already existed for
 *    three tables: `packages/app-shell/src/__tests__/defaults-maps-mirror-en-pack.test.tsx`
 *    (objectui#4401) compares `DETAIL_`/`LIST_`/`DESIGNER_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS`
 *    against the pack key by key. That test found the divergence it was written
 *    for; what it could not do is cover the other 29 tables, because each one
 *    would have to be added by hand. This class takes the population from the
 *    SOURCE instead — every `createSafeTranslation(...)` /
 *    `createSafeTranslationHook(...)` invocation, whatever its table is called —
 *    so a 33rd factory is covered on the day it is written, with nothing to
 *    register.
 *
 *    HARD from day one, and here the measurement is the whole story. The census
 *    objectui#7567 SHIPPED ON — 32 factory sites, 32 distinct tables, 846 rows,
 *    841 of them comparable against `en`, 0 drifted — is a reading of the tree
 *    that card landed against, and it is dated on purpose: today's numbers are
 *    the ones the run prints on its own `Factory defaults tables:` summary
 *    line, which is where a reader takes them from. objectui#7454's instance,
 *    the one known member of the class, was aligned in objectui#7574 before this
 *    class landed, which is why there is no ledger section here: a ledger with
 *    nothing in it is a mechanism asserting nothing, and it would read exactly
 *    like a populated one. The abstention counts below are printed on every run
 *    for the same reason the dynamic-key count is — an instrument's blind spot
 *    is a number, not a silence.
 *
 *    Deliberately NOT judged (counted instead), and each abstention is a
 *    decision. Each bullet NAMES THE COUNTER it increments rather than
 *    restating that counter's value: all four are on the `Factory defaults
 *    tables:` summary line of every run, and a value transcribed into this
 *    comment is true only until the next table moves — objectui#8102 is the
 *    card that measured this paragraph claiming five rows the tree had not
 *    carried since objectui#7887.
 *
 *      - A first argument that does not resolve to an object literal — a table
 *        built by a spread, a call, or an identifier this parser cannot follow
 *        to its `const`. Counted as an unreadable TABLE
 *        (`factoryUnreadableTables`), which is the loudest of these numbers: it
 *        is not one row leaving the surface, it is all of them.
 *      - A row whose key is computed, or whose value is not a static string
 *        (`factoryUnreadableRows`). Same abstention as a computed
 *        `defaultValue` in class 3, and for the same reason: there is no text
 *        to compare.
 *      - A row whose key `en` does not define (`factoryRowsNoEnKey`). That is
 *        class 1's shape, not this one's, and the two stay disjoint exactly as
 *        classes 1 and 3 do. It is worth knowing that class 1 CANNOT reach
 *        these: it judges call sites, and a table row with no call site
 *        anywhere is invisible to it. The worked example is objectui#7874's
 *        five `timeline.relative.*` rows in
 *        `packages/plugin-timeline/src/useTimelineTranslation.ts` — no `en`
 *        leaf and no caller, so this counter was the only reader in the repo
 *        that could see them, and once it did they were retired in
 *        objectui#7887. That is the whole argument for printing the count
 *        rather than absorbing it, and the argument does not need the bucket to
 *        be occupied: an empty one is the outcome the printing bought, and the
 *        day it stops being empty the run says so.
 *      - A key that resolves only through its plural suffixes, or an `en` leaf
 *        this parser could not read as a string (`factoryUnjudgedRows`). There
 *        is no single form to compare against; picking one would be an
 *        invention. Same words as class 3's own abstention, because it is the
 *        same abstention.
 *
 *    A NESTED object literal inside a table is deliberately NOT descended into,
 *    and this is the one place where copying
 *    `packages/i18n/src/__tests__/fallback-placeholder-spelling-3512.test.ts`'s
 *    table reader would be wrong. That test recurses with a dotted prefix; this
 *    class must not, because `fallbackT` does a FLAT `defaults[key]` lookup — a
 *    row spelled `{ calendar: { today: 'Today' } }` is never read by anything at
 *    runtime, so comparing it against `en.calendar.today` would green-light a
 *    dead row. It falls into "value is not a static string" instead, where a
 *    dead row belongs — inside `factoryUnreadableRows`, with the rest of that
 *    bullet, where the run prints it. The abstention is what stops the first
 *    one being read as healthy.
 *
 *    THE OTHER HALF OF THE POPULATION — objectui#7877, the B half of the
 *    ruling on objectui#7567 Q2. Three tables hand-roll `fallbackT`'s literal
 *    needle instead of taking the factory, so the walk above cannot see them:
 *    nothing in the source says which local function is a `fallbackT`. Two of
 *    them are reachable no other way (`GANTT_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS`,
 *    `IMPORT_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS`); the third,
 *    `TIMELINE_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS`, also reaches the factory and is already
 *    counted above.
 *
 *    Covering them takes a DECLARATION — which is why objectui#7567 shipped
 *    the registry-free half first and split this out, and why the population
 *    here is `packages/test-support/src/hand-rolled-tables.json` and not a
 *    heuristic. Option C on that card (gate every `Record<string, string>`
 *    that looks like a defaults map, inferred rather than declared) was
 *    rejected for inventing a heuristic where a declaration is available.
 *
 *    The two halves keep SEPARATE counters, a separate collapse floor and a
 *    separate summary line, and that separation is the point rather than
 *    tidiness: the factory walk compares hundreds of rows — its own summary
 *    line says how many — so a registry that stopped resolving anything at all
 *    would be invisible inside a combined number,
 *    and this half's verdict — also "0 drifted" — would be read off an empty
 *    scan set. Its floor is 150 against a measured 215 (80 + 135), chosen to
 *    sit above the LARGER of the two tables so that losing either one fails.
 *
 *    What keeps the declaration from rotting is not diligence and does not
 *    live here:
 *    `packages/i18n/src/__tests__/fallback-placeholder-spelling-3512.test.ts`
 *    asserts that the set of runtime files carrying the hand-rolled needle
 *    equals a pinned list, and that every declared entry contributes rows. A
 *    fourth hand-rolled `fallbackT` turns that case red naming its own file.
 *    Because this gate reads the SAME bytes that test reads rather than a
 *    copy of them, that one ratchet covers both readers — the reason the data
 *    moved to JSON on objectui#6923's ruling instead of being duplicated here
 *    and pinned.
 *
 * ## Dynamic keys: the explicit policy
 *
 * A key that is not a string literal cannot be resolved statically. Those call
 * sites are **not checked and not failed** — they are COUNTED, and the count is
 * printed on every run, so the unanalyzable surface is visible rather than
 * silently absorbed. The `missing-prefix` class above recovers the part of it
 * that can be decided, and class 6 recovers the part of THAT which a declared
 * vocabulary can settle; what neither reaches is a dynamic key with no static
 * head at all (`t(key)` on a variable — 35 sites), which nothing but a type
 * checker could resolve. Same treatment, same reason, for the deliberate
 * `I18N_PROBE_FLAG` misses (see below) and for the skipped binding classes.
 *
 * ## Key-building helpers: the leg that needs no call site (objectui#7592)
 *
 * Everything above starts at a `t()`/`tt()` call and reads its arguments. A
 * module that BUILDS a key and hands it to a translator it received as a plain
 * function VALUE has no such call for the walk to start from:
 *
 *   export function toolTitleKey(name) { return `ns.family.${name}`; }
 *   // …
 *   return translate ? translate(toolTitleKey(trimmed), english) : english;
 *
 * `translate` is a parameter, not `t`/`tt`, so the callee never matches; and the
 * file holds no `t(` spelling at all, so the pre-filter below drops it before
 * anything is even parsed. Both reverse-sweep legs and both family ratchets are
 * therefore blind at once — measured on `chatbot.tool.*`, whose 35 live,
 * rendering keys put 33 entries into `check-i18n-dead-keys.mjs`'s CONFIRMED
 * tier, 22% of it, one deletion away from reverting every AI tool card to
 * English in nine locales (objectui#7592, the regression cloud#1658 filed and
 * objectui#7254 fixed).
 *
 * So the head is read WHERE IT IS WRITTEN instead. A KEY BUILDER is a function
 * whose whole body is one returned template literal whose head is a dotted key
 * prefix that resolves against `en`; its head and tail feed `dynamicHeads` and
 * `dynamicFamilies` exactly as a template ARGUMENT would, which means the
 * family lands under the same two ratchets: undeclared is a red, and a builder
 * that stops being one turns its declaration stale, also a red. That is the
 * anti-vacuous half — a detection leg that silently degrades to a no-op is the
 * failure mode this whole class of card is about.
 *
 * Three boundaries, each load-bearing and each measured on this tree:
 *
 *   1. ONE returned template, nothing else. A multi-statement helper composes
 *      its head from things this parser cannot follow, and reading its first
 *      template anyway would invent families out of unrelated strings.
 *   2. The head must RESOLVE against `en` (`headMatches`), which is what makes
 *      this a key probe rather than a template-literal census: 97 files hold a
 *      dotted template, and requiring the head to prefix a real pack path is
 *      what leaves the builder shapes that are about i18n. The consequence is
 *      deliberate and is the one place this leg differs from the argument
 *      position: a builder whose head matches NOTHING is not recognised at all,
 *      so it never raises `missing-prefix`. Judging it would make every
 *      `` `${a}.${b}` `` in the repo a candidate defect.
 *   3. The registered local tables are skipped, same scope rule the call-site
 *      classifier uses — a builder inside `metadata-admin/` builds `engine.*`
 *      keys that are not in any pack by design.
 *
 * Blast radius on this checkout: 1 builder, 1 head, 47 extra files parsed out of
 * 1572 walked. The leg is narrow BY MEASUREMENT, not by hope.
 *
 * ## The probe exclusion
 *
 * `useObjectLabel` probes convention keys (`{ns}.objects.{name}.label`) that are
 * SUPPOSED to miss — it falls back to the server-resolved label. Those calls
 * carry `[I18N_PROBE_FLAG]: true`, and this gate excludes them by that flag, not
 * by path, so a probe written anywhere is excluded and a non-probe call in
 * `useObjectLabel.ts` is not. Both of today's probe sites happen to use dynamic
 * keys, so the flag currently only moves them out of the dynamic counter; the
 * exclusion is still load-bearing for the literal-key probe someone writes next,
 * and `scripts/__tests__/check-i18n-call-site-keys.test.ts` pins that shape.
 *
 * ## The baseline
 *
 * `scripts/i18n-call-site-key-baseline.json` lists the keys already missing on
 * `main` when this gate landed, each with the issue tracking its fix — classes 1,
 * 2 and 6 only; classes 3, 4 and 5 have no baseline and never needed one. It is a
 * ratchet, not an allowlist: a key that is NOT in it fails, and an entry that no
 * longer fires (key added to `en`, or its last call site deleted) ALSO fails, so
 * the file can only shrink. Fixing the debt means adding the key to
 * `packages/i18n/src/locales/en.ts` — which immediately makes
 * `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` demand it in the other nine packs, which is
 * the correct order.

 *     ever inspected, so a single-brace hole cannot reach a verdict here —
 *     excluded by where the rule looks, not by an allow-list that could rot.
 *   - **JSX object literals.** `style={{ opacity: 0 }}` is `{{` that is syntax,
 *     not copy. This rule never greps source text: it is handed the TEXT of a
 *     string literal or the literal segments of a template, and a JSX brace is
 *     not inside either.
 *
 * ## The sibling copy, named rather than hidden — and now pinned to it
 *
 * `packages/i18n/src/__tests__/placeholder-spelling-rule.ts`
 * (`placeholderViolations`, enforced by `fallback-placeholder-spelling-3512.test.ts`)
 * carries the same rule over the ten locale packs and the discovered defaults
 * TABLES. This copy exists because that gate is a vitest suite reading copy
 * tables and this one is a node script reading call-site ARGUMENTS — the walk
 * that finds a `defaultValue` is the classifier this file already owns, and
 * rebuilding it there was rejected on objectui#4905.
 *
 * Until objectui#7310 the only thing holding the two together was that each
 * names the other and each has its own self-test, which is a promise rather
 * than a mechanism: it survives exactly as long as whoever widens one of them
 * happens to read both. `scripts/__tests__/placeholder-spelling-parity.test.ts`
 * is the mechanism — it feeds one corpus (both self-tests' cases, a grammar
 * matrix over every dialect and boundary, every string leaf of the ten packs
 * and every discovered defaults row) through BOTH implementations and fails
 * naming the input they disagreed on. Merging the two was measured first and is
 * closed in both directions; that file's header records what was measured.
 *
 * ⇒ Widening this rule means widening it on BOTH sides, in one change. The
 * parity gate is not a thing to relax when it goes red — it going red IS the

 *
 * `missing-prefix` (class 2) is the only claim about a template key that is

 * ten packs identically missing `filterBuilder.operators.isNull` is full
 * parity, and full parity is green. Users read the raw key
 * (objectui#4964; the measured instance was fixed in objectui#4962).
 *
 * Closing that needs the member set, and a member set is a decision, not a
 * measurement: `t(`grid.import.jobStatus.${job.status}`)` is exactly checkable
 * only because `ImportJobStatus` is a union of five string literals somewhere,
 * while `t(`approvalsInbox.${key}`)` forwards a `key: string` parameter and has
 * no member set at all. This file parses source without a type checker (see
 * `collectEnKeys`'s header — no build step, no TS loader), so it cannot follow
 * `job.status` to its declaration. What it CAN do is read a declaration a human
 * NAMES, from the module that holds it.
 *
 * So each family below is one of two things, and the split is the point:
 *
 *   - `vocabulary` — the member set is a named declaration this file reads from
 *     source. Every `head + member + tail` is then checked as an ordinary key,
 *     and a member missing from `en` is a `missing-member` finding.
 *   - `enumerable: false` — there is no static member set. The family keeps its
 *     prefix check and NOTHING ELSE, and the `reason` says why. Pretending
 *     otherwise would produce either false reds (guessing a vocabulary) or a
 *     check that silently skips the family (the failure mode this card names).
 *
 * ## Both ratchet directions
 *
 * A head observed in the scan with no entry here is `undeclared-dynamic-family`
 * and fails: a new template family cannot land unguarded, which is what let the
 * twenty-odd families below accumulate unmeasured. An entry whose head no
 * longer appears is `stale-dynamic-family` and fails too, so this list can only
 * describe families that exist. And a `vocabulary` that resolves to ZERO
 * members is `empty-vocabulary` — a vacuous exact check reads identical to a
 * passing one, and that is the one way this class could quietly cover less than
 * the prefix check it sits on top of. The prefix check itself is untouched: it
 * still runs for every dynamic head, declared or not.
 *
 * `kind` tells the reader what shape the declaration is:
 *
 *   `union`          `type X = 'a' | 'b'`                    -> the literals
 *   `array`          `const X = ['a', 'b'] as const`         -> the elements
 *   `arrayField`     `const X = [{ value: 'a' }, …]` + field -> that field's values
 *   `objectKeys`     `const X = { a: …, b: … }`              -> the property names
 *   `objectField`    `const X = { a: { k: 'x' } }` + field   -> that field's values
 *   `set`            `const X = new Set(['a', 'b'])`         -> the elements
 *   `interfaceField` `interface X { f: 'a' | 'b' }` + field  -> that property's literals
 *
 * And `enumerable: false` carries a `why`, because the four reasons are not the
 * same finding and only one of them is permanent:
 *
 *   `runtime-data`        the substitution is server- or user-supplied. There is
 *                         no member set to know, at any point, by anyone.
 *   `external-vocabulary` the member set exists and is authoritative, but it
 *                         lives in a dependency (`@objectstack/spec`), not in
 *                         this repo's source. Bridgeable — by a repo-local
 *                         exhaustive `Record<Union, …>` this reader can read.
 *   `unnamed-union`       the member set is written inline (a parameter
 *                         annotation, an anonymous state type) rather than as a
 *                         declaration that can be named. Bridgeable by naming it.
 *   `open-forwarder`      the call site takes `key: string` and forwards it, so
 *                         the family is the whole namespace and the template is
 *                         a namespace prefix, not a member position.
