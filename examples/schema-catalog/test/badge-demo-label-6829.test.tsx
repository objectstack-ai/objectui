/**
 * objectui#6829 (arm A) — every catalog `badge` node draws its authored text,
 * measured as the pill's RENDERED text and compared to the `label` it authors.
 *
 * ## The reading this file was written against
 *
 * `packages/components/src/renderers/data-display/badge.tsx` renders
 * `schema.label || renderChildren(schema.body)`: it reads `label` and `body`
 * and never `children`. Seven catalog nodes authored `children` anyway —
 * `components-basic-span/{default-badge, secondary-badge, status-badges x3}`
 * and `core-schema-renderer/nested-schema-example x2` — and were carried as
 * the exact `BADGE_CHILDREN_LEDGER_6829` in
 * `catalog-authored-key-6805-6806.test.tsx` until the card was ruled. That
 * file owns the KEY half (the read set, per renderer); this one owns the
 * RENDER half.
 *
 * Re-derived on this branch's base `ce45a0306`, walking all 431 fixtures:
 *
 *     badge nodes                 40   in 12 categories
 *     keys authored on them       type 40 · variant 36 · label 33 ·
 *                                 className 8 · children 7
 *
 * (The card's census read `label 31 · content 2`; the two `content` nodes had
 * already moved to `label` with objectui#6805/#6806.) Rendered through the
 * real `SchemaRenderer` the way the docs gallery renders them, BEFORE the
 * fixture edits:
 *
 *     entry                                        elements   text
 *     components-basic-span/default-badge                 2   ""
 *     components-basic-span/secondary-badge               2   ""
 *     components-basic-span/status-badges                 5   ""
 *     core-schema-renderer/nested-schema-example         13   "Parent ComponentSibling Component
 *                                                             All rendered from a single schema tree"
 *
 * AFTER — the seven nodes re-authored to `label`, the spelling the other 33
 * badge nodes already use:
 *
 *     components-basic-span/default-badge                 2   "Badge Style"
 *     components-basic-span/secondary-badge               2   "Secondary"
 *     components-basic-span/status-badges                 5   "● Active● Pending● Inactive"
 *     core-schema-renderer/nested-schema-example         13   "Parent ComponentNestedComponents
 *                                                             Sibling ComponentAll rendered
 *                                                             from a single schema tree"
 *
 * (`elements` counts this file's one wrapper `div`; the gallery harness adds
 * two, which is where its `WRAPPER_ELEMENTS = 2` comes from.)
 *
 * ## Why a PER-RENDERER pin, not a stricter global threshold
 *
 * `catalog-gallery-render.test.tsx` rendered all four entries before the fix
 * and PASSED. Its non-vacuity control is `elements > WRAPPER_ELEMENTS || text`,
 * and the empty pill's OWN host element is the element past the wrappers, so
 * a demo drawing nothing but an empty pill clears the control on the pill.
 * That is the third independent hole in that one control (objectui#6805:
 * Radix's injected stylesheet counts as text; objectui#6806: a large correct
 * render hides a small omission), which is the argument that the instrument
 * belongs per renderer. So nothing here is a threshold: the assertion is that
 * the pill's rendered text EQUALS the label the fixture authors, for every
 * `badge` node in the corpus, at any depth, in any entry.
 *
 * ## The discriminating question this file was written against
 *
 * "Would an implementation strictly worse than the bug pass this pin?" A pin
 * asserting "the demo renders at least one element" passes on an empty pill —
 * that is the hole above. A pin asserting "non-empty text" passes on a
 * renderer that emits one constant string for every node. The corpus
 * assertion below compares the FULL vector of rendered texts to the full
 * vector of authored labels and pins that the two are equally diverse: the
 * constant-string caricature fails it on every node, and the empty pill fails
 * it on every node it used to hide behind.
 *
 * ## The non-regression axis — derived from the plausible WRONG fix
 *
 * The plausible wrong fix is a blind sweep renaming `children` to `label`
 * across the corpus. It satisfies "the badges now draw" and breaks every
 * container that legitimately authors `children` — 652 non-badge nodes on this
 * base (`flex` 248 · `stack` 153 · `card` 86 · `box` 76 · `grid` 22 · …).
 * Measured: that sweep applied to `nested-schema-example` renders the EMPTY
 * string (2 elements — the wrapper and a bare `stack`). The last block pins
 * that the corpus still authors `children` on hundreds of containers, that the
 * touched entries' own containers still draw their children, and that the
 * blind-sweep shape is the empty demo it is.
 *
 * ## ⛔ What arm A did NOT do — and what closed it afterwards
 *
 * Arm A restored four demos and did not close the class: `children` was
 * declared on `BaseSchema`, accepted by every other container renderer,
 * refused by neither zod nor tsc (`BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()` with an
 * index signature), and consumed by the pipeline before it could leak to the
 * DOM — so the next author who wrote `children` on a badge drew an empty pill
 * again. Arm B (teaching `badge.tsx` to read `children`) widened a published
 * renderer's read set, which AGENTS.md #0.1 governs, and was left to
 * objectui#6810's decision.
 *
 * ⭐ **objectui#6771's retirement of the `body` dialect closed it from the other
 * side, and this file's counter-probes moved with it.** The maintainer ruled
 * one spelling for the child list; `badge` converged on `children`, so the key
 * that draws an empty pill is now `body`. ⛔ Read this as the class being
 * closed by a CONTRACT decision, not as arm B being taken — nothing widened,
 * one spelling was retired and the other is what every renderer reads.
 * ⚠️ objectui#6810 asked whether `badge` should read `children`; that question
 * is answered by a different ruling than the one it was waiting for, which is
 * reported on objectui#6771 rather than decided here.
 *
 * Module-scope import of `@object-ui/components`, not `beforeAll` (AGENTS.md
 * §测试纪律): registering the renderers is an unbounded module load and must
 * not be billed to a bounded hook timeout.
