/**
 * Declaration pin — the ten gantt keys `ObjectGantt` reads that
 * `ObjectGanttSchema` did not declare (objectui#5903).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * All ten were read as `(schema as any).K` in
 * `plugin-gantt/src/ObjectGantt.tsx`. Every one is a real, working, documented
 * feature (they are named in the package README), but nothing connected the
 * read to a declaration: not `tsc`, not the registry `inputs`, not this
 * package's zod mirror. An author following the published type could not
 * discover any of them.
 *
 * Eleven keys were reported. `label` is the eleventh and it needed no
 * declaration — `BaseSchema` already declares it — so only its cast was
 * dropped. `label` is pinned below anyway, because "already declared" is the
 * claim that would silently stop being true.
 *
 * ## What the pin has teeth against, and what it does not
 *
 * `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()` on the zod side and carries
 * `[key: string]: any` on the TS side (objectui#5155 records that ceiling), so:
 *
 *   - an UNDECLARED key is still accepted, by both halves. Declaring these ten
 *     did NOT buy rejection of a misspelling, and the test below pins that
 *     plainly rather than leaving it to be assumed;
 *   - a DECLARED key IS validated. `readOnly: 'yes'` parsed green before this
 *     card and is refused now — that is the accept-set narrowing landed here,
 *     the same one objectui#5074 landed for `viewMode`;
 *   - on the TS side the index signature means a read site can never be the
 *     detector: `schema.readOnly` type-checks as `any` whether or not the key
 *     is declared. So the compile-time pin is the `@ts-expect-error` block at
 *     the bottom — remove a declaration and its member resolves to `any`, the
 *     wrong-typed assignment starts succeeding, and the now-unused directive
 *     fails the build (TS2578) NAMING the key. `tsconfig.test.json` compiles
 *     this file, so that is real enforcement and not decoration (#3009).
