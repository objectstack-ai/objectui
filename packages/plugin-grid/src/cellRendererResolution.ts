/**
 * THE GRID'S SINGLE ANSWER TO "WHICH CELL RENDERER?" (objectui#8920).
 *
 * ## The defect this module exists to close
 *
 * `@object-ui/fields` publishes a TWO-STEP resolve:
 * `getCellRenderer(resolveCellRendererType(field))`. The second step exists
 * because a field's DECLARED type is not always the renderer's key — a textual
 * base type carrying a `format` hint (`phone`, `email`, `url`, `currency`,
 * `percent`) maps to the richer renderer. Skip it and the cell gets
 * `TextCellRenderer`, which destructures only `value` and therefore never reads
 * `field.format`: the hint is dropped, nothing throws, nothing warns, and the
 * column silently renders as plain truncated text instead of a `tel:` /
 * `mailto:` / formatted value.
 *
 * `ObjectGrid` used to spell that resolve SIX times with THREE conventions —
 * one two-step, four raw declared types, one fixed registry key. Patching the
 * four to match the one leaves the divergence in place and lets a seventh site
 * pick either convention, so the resolution itself lives here instead: every
 * `getCellRenderer` call the grid makes is made from this module, and
 * `ObjectGrid.tsx` no longer imports `getCellRenderer` at all. That invariant
 * is pinned by `__tests__/cellRendererResolutionBoundary-8920.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Two resolutions, two names — the trap that hid the defect
 *
 * The word "resolve" named two different things in this file's caller, and the
 * collision is most of why four sites read as correct:
 *
 *   - "resolve which TYPE the field has" — `objectDef type > heuristic
 *     inference`. That answer is `declaredType`, and it is what the inline
 *     editor and the emitted `type:` key read.
 *   - "resolve which RENDERER the type maps to" — the published two-step.
 *     That answer is `rendererType`, and it is what `getCellRenderer`,
 *     `fieldMeta.type`, the header icon and the numeric alignment read.
 *
 * A local called `resolvedType` that held only the first one reads exactly like
 * a value the second step had already been applied to. Both are named here so
 * no call site has to hold the distinction in its head.

 * documented — rather than one documented way plus a bare `getCellRenderer`
