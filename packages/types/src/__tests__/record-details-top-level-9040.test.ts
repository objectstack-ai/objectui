/**
 * objectui#9040 — `RecordDetailsComponentProps`'s TOP LEVEL against the
 * contract, in both directions. objectui#8583 reconciled `sections[]`
 * member-for-member and objectui#8604 fixed the top-level `columns` type; the
 * top-level KEY SET had never been reconciled, and it diverged both ways.
 *
 * Direction 1 — OMISSIONS (fixed here). `hideFields`, `inlineEdit` and
 * `showHeader` are declared by `@objectstack/spec`, read by
 * `RecordDetailsRenderer`, and published as inputs by
 * `@object-ui/plugin-detail`'s registry manifest (objectui#3808 for
 * `hideFields`, objectui#4668 for the other two). Every layer declared them
 * except this published TypeScript face, so a spec-valid, renderer-honoured,
 * registry-published document was refused by `tsc` with `TS2353`.
 *
 * Direction 2 — the RETIRED `layout` (DONE, item 1 of the same card). The
 * contract refuses it by name; this face offered a third spelling of it. The
 * key is now GONE from this interface, which is a published-surface
 * retirement — `.changeset/9040-retire-record-details-layout.md` carries its
 * FROM/TO. The legs below no longer ledger an open divergence; they assert the
 * removal and go red if the member is re-added.
 *
 * ⚠️ The consumer survey that removal needed is the reason this file gained a
 * SOURCE-TEXT leg. `tsc` named two consumer files; it is structurally blind to
 * the third (`record-highlights-layout-9187.test.ts` read this declaration as
 * TEXT), and vitest is blind to the two. Neither instrument alone enumerates
 * the consumers of a published type — that reading is recorded here so the
 * next retirement on this interface does not re-learn it from CI.
 *
 * ── Three instruments, and no one of them sees the whole change ─────────────
 *   - `tsc` sees the `@ts-expect-error` legs and the `Equal` assertions. That
 *     is the ONLY half that discriminates direction 1's fix from its defect,
 *     because that defect was a TypeScript-only refusal. It means nothing
 *     unless `type-check` runs — vitest strips types.
 *   - vitest runs the `safeParse` legs against the INSTALLED published spec
 *     artifact (the version `check:installed-pin-claims` re-derives), each with
 *     a control that would have fired. ⚠️ Those legs read the SPEC ONLY: they
 *     were green before this card and are green after, so they are the PREMISE,
 *     never the evidence. They are labelled PREMISE below so nobody counts them
 *     as the fix.
 *   - vitest ALSO reads this package's own declaration as TEXT, so a
 *     re-introduced `layout` is caught by a run that never type-checks. Its
 *     control is the sibling interface, whose `layout` the contract DOES
 *     declare: the same matcher finds that one.
