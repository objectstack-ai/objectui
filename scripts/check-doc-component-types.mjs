/**
 * Every `type` string literal in a `content/docs/**` code block — `.mdx` and
 * `.md` alike — and in the root `README.md` (objectui#7115), must name a
 * component the repository actually registers, or be declared, per file, as
 * belonging to some other vocabulary. Since objectui#5106
 * the same question is also asked of the KEY TABLES that document a plugin's
 * registrations, on BOTH halves of the row: the namespaced key and the bare-name
 * fallback (see "The second surface" below).
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-doc-component-types.mjs   (also `pnpm check:doc-types`)
 * Exit: 0 = every teaching snippet names a registered type (or a declared
 *       exemption), 1 = at least one snippet teaches a type nothing registers,
 *       an exemption has gone stale, or the scan collapsed.
 *
 * ## The failure this closes (objectui#4823, recurrence #4 would have been free)
 *
 * `examples/schema-catalog/test/catalog-gallery-render.test.tsx` (objectui#4616)
 * renders every catalog entry and fails if any paints the registry's
 * "Unknown component type" panel (OBJUI-001). The TEACHING surface had no
 * equivalent: a ```plaintext block in `content/docs/**` is not rendered, not
 * parsed and not compared against anything, so a snippet could name any `type`
 * string at all and CI stayed green end to end.
 *
 * The same defect landed three times before this gate existed, each one found
 * by a human probe rather than by a check:
 *
 *   objectui#4786  `content/docs/**`                 taught `stats-card`
 *   objectui#4796  `content/docs/fields/grid.mdx`    taught `plugin:grid`   (real: `object-grid`)
 *   objectui#4796  `content/docs/fields/location.mdx` taught `plugin:map`   (real: `object-map`)
 *
 * A reader who copied any of them got a red panel instead of a component. The
 * first scan under this gate found two more of exactly that shape, fixed in the
 * same PR: `heading` (`utilities/runner.mdx`, `utilities/vscode-extension.mdx`
 * — nothing registers it; `h1` does) and `multi-step-form`
 * (`plugins/plugin-form.mdx` — the string appears nowhere in the repo outside
 * that snippet; the wizard is `object-form` + `formType: 'wizard'`, which
 * `WizardFormSchema` declares).
 *
 * NOT in scope, deliberately: whether the snippet's OTHER keys are read by the
 * renderer the type resolves to. That is objectui#4823's second dimension and
 * needs a per-renderer read-point contract; this gate answers one question only
 * — does the type exist.
 *
 * ## Where the registered-key universe comes from — derived, never a list
 *
 * A hard-coded key list would be the Nth copy of an enumeration this repo
 * already keeps in the register calls themselves, and it would rot the first
 * time a plugin adds a component. So the universe is derived from source on
 * every run, with no build step (which is what lets this run as a per-PR check
 * next to `check-doc-links.mjs` rather than behind a `turbo build`):
 *
 *   - DIRECT: `X.register('key', …)` / `X.registerLazy('key', …)` for the
 *     receivers listed in `REGISTRY_RECEIVERS`. `namespace` and `skipFallback`
 *     are read out of the call's OWN balanced argument span — not a fixed-size
 *     window. That distinction is load-bearing and was measured: with a
 *     1500-character window, `plugin-grid/src/index.tsx`'s `object-grid`
 *     registration (line 129) picked up the `skipFallback: true` belonging to
 *     the `grid` registration 12 lines below it, and the derivation silently
 *     dropped the bare `object-grid` key — which 13 doc sites teach correctly.
 *     A window bug in a derivation this gate trusts shows up as a false RED on
 *     correct documentation, so the span is matched, not guessed.
 *   - OPTIONS: `namespace` and `skipFallback` decide which keys a registration
 *     publishes, so `resolveRegistrationOptions` reads an ALLOWLIST of exactly
 *     two ARGUMENT shapes and REPORTS every other argument shape. Read: an
 *     object literal whose top-level entries are all key-value pairs or spreads
 *     of a plain identifier, and a bare identifier that resolves to one such
 *     literal which the same file declares exactly once — counting only names
 *     immediately after `const` / `let` / `var` or in an import clause — with
 *     `const`, and whose `namespace` or `skipFallback` this file does not
 *     assign, `delete` or `Object.assign` onto IN ONE OF THE THREE SPELLINGS
 *     `optionsMutatedAfterDeclaration` matches. ⚠️ Those two qualifications are
 *     the whole of it: the allowlist is structural about the ARGUMENT, while
 *     following a NAME rests on premises this derivation enforces only against
 *     the spellings it can see. `declaredObjectBody` and
 *     `optionsMutatedAfterDeclaration` carry the exact conditions and the
 *     measured list of shapes that slip through them SILENTLY, each pinned as a
 *     KNOWN GAP reading in `check-doc-component-types.test.ts` —
 *     `register('page', R, pageMeta)` and
 *     `register('app', R, { ...pageMeta, label: 'App Page' })` are both read,
 *     and `counters.metaViaReference` counts every site whose options arrived
 *     that way and were read — namespaced or not — which the run summary
 *     prints and a pin in the objectui#5115 suite asserts is non-zero.
 *
 *     ⛔ The allowlist is the point, and it is structural rather than a list of
 *     idioms to keep up with. Reading only the call span found no `namespace:`
 *     in either line above, so both were read as bare-only and their
 *     `namespace:key` halves were lost SILENTLY — objectui#9641, five real
 *     runtime keys absent from the universe while the firing control (the same
 *     registration shape with its options spelled out at the call) was present,
 *     which is what made it a defect rather than a choice. A best-effort repair
 *     reproduces it: a cast, a member expression, a call, a spread of any of
 *     those, a conditional spread, a computed `namespace` and a computed
 *     `skipFallback` were each measured falling through to the same silent
 *     bare-only reading. Any ARGUMENT shape not on the allowlist is therefore an
 *     `unresolved-registration-meta` finding, one fixture pin per shape in
 *     `check-doc-component-types.test.ts`. ⛔ That sentence is about the
 *     argument only: a name the allowlist accepts can still be read against the
 *     wrong object, and those readings are silent rather than reported. They
 *     are enumerated where they live, and pinned.
 *
 *     ⚠️ The same correction had to be made twice, one layer down: the
 *     allowlist is structural about the ARGUMENT, and the identifier route
 *     rests on a premise about the NAME. A `const` cannot be reassigned but its
 *     contents can be written, and a `namespace` deleted after declaration used
 *     to mint a phantom through the very binding this derivation treats as
 *     safe. Those conditions now live in `declaredObjectBody`, which is where
 *     to read them —
 *     restating them here would be a second copy to keep honest. Whether that refusal costs this tree
 *     anything is a question for the gate, not for this comment: it reds
 *     nothing today, and the day a registration reaches for one of these shapes
 *     it is told so instead of losing half its keys.
 *   - LOOP: `for (const v of ['a','b'])`, `for (const v of ARR)` and
 *     `ARR.forEach(v => …)` where `ARR` is a literal array in the same file.
 *     Five registration sites use this form (`html-elements.tsx`'s `TAGS`,
 *     `semantic.tsx`'s `tags`, and three `for (const variant of […])` blocks in
 *     `apps/console`).
 *   - INDIRECT: two helpers register from a collection, and each is named
 *     explicitly in `INDIRECT_REGISTRATIONS` with the collection it reads. Both
 *     entries are re-derived per run; a named collection that disappears or
 *     stops yielding keys fails the gate rather than shrinking the universe.
 *     ⚠️ The bypass that lets these unresolvable calls through is keyed by
 *     COLLECTION, which is what the table's coverage is keyed by. It was keyed
 *     by FILE until objectui#9717, and the two keyings are not the same set:
 *     ANY unresolvable registration living in a table-named file was skipped
 *     silently, including one whose collection the table never names.
 *     `registerAllFields()`'s `RETIRED_FIELD_TYPES` tombstone loop is the
 *     measured instance — it shares `packages/fields/src/index.tsx` with the
 *     `fieldWidgetMap` entry, so its key reached neither the universe nor a
 *     finding, and its namespace was silently folded into the reconciliation of
 *     a collection it has nothing to do with. The supplying collection is now
 *     DERIVED at the call by `indirectSupply` and matched against the entries
 *     declared for that file: `uncovered-indirect-collection` when no entry
 *     names it, `unresolved-indirect-collection` when the supplier cannot be
 *     read at all. ⛔ Neither is answered by adding the missing KEY anywhere by
 *     hand — a hand-kept key is the construction objectui#9703 removed.
 *     ⚠️ The NAMESPACE of those keys is read from the registration call, not
 *     from the entry: the entry's `namespace` is a DECLARATION reconciled
 *     against the call, and a disagreement is reported. It was an input to this
 *     derivation until objectui#9703, with nothing checking it — a namespace
 *     edit at one of these calls could not reach the generated universe, and
 *     this derivation stayed green while disagreeing with the runtime. Read the
 *     `indirect-namespace-drift` / `unresolved-indirect-namespace` reasons
 *     below for what is reported and why the table is not consulted on a fall
 *     back. `skipFallback` is the half that genuinely cannot be derived — these
 *     helpers decide it per key — so `skipFallbackSet` stays declared, and a
 *     set name that stops resolving is reported rather than read as empty.
 *   - OPEN: a handful of call sites take a key that is not knowable statically
 *     (a third-party plugin's own type, a widget manifest's `type`). Those are
 *     listed in `OPEN_REGISTRATION_SITES` with the reason. Every OTHER
 *     unresolvable call site fails the gate as `unresolved-registration` — a
 *     new dynamic registration path must be taught to this derivation, because
 *     silently missing one narrows the universe and turns correct docs red.
 *
 * The universe is deliberately GENEROUS: it unions every key any package or app
 * in the repo can register, including the opt-in protocol placeholders, without
 * modelling which host loaded which package. A doc site is judged on "does this
 * string name a component that exists", never on "is it registered in the host
 * this page happens to describe". Host-specific registration is a different
 * question with a different answer per page, and a gate that guessed at it
 * would produce exactly the false reds that get gates deleted.
 *
 * ## How a doc site is judged, and why there is no structural discriminator
 *
 * `type` is not one vocabulary in these pages. Measured over all 143 files on
 * the tree this gate was written against — 560 `type: '…'` sites in fenced code
 * blocks — the corpus carries at least seven distinct vocabularies that all
 * spell the key `type`:
 *
 *   SDUI component keys   `{ type: 'object-grid', … }`          the one this gate judges
 *   action schemas        `action: { type: 'submit' }`          `@object-ui/types`' ActionSchema
 *   block schemas         `type: 'block-instance'`              `packages/types/src/blocks.ts`
 *   theme / report schemas`type: 'theme-switcher'`, `'matrix'`  `types/src/theme.ts`, `reports.ts`
 *   field + JSON-Schema   `type: 'string'`, `type: 'currency'`  variable / property declarations
 *   validation rules      `validation: [{ type: 'minLength' }]` form rule discriminants
 *   nav + feed items      `type: 'item'`, `type: 'comment'`     menu entries, activity feed items
 *
 * The obvious discriminator — classify by the enclosing key path, so a `type`
 * under `validation` is a rule and a `type` under `children` is a node — was
 * built and MEASURED before being rejected. Two findings killed it. First, the
 * snippets are TypeScript as often as JSON, and a TS annotation reads exactly
 * like an object key to a brace-tracking scanner: `const heroBlock: BlockSchema
 * = {` made `heroBlock` the enclosing key for everything inside it, and 31 of
 * the 92 off-registry sites came out with a path a human would not recognise.
 * Second, and fatally, the fix does not converge: `items` carries nav entries on
 * one page and renderable children on another, so any global parent-key rule is
 * a silent false GREEN on one of them. A misclassifying discriminator is worse
 * than none, because its mistakes are invisible in both directions.
 *
 * So the rule is flat and stated rather than inferred:
 *
 *     EVERY `type` string literal in a docs code block is a candidate SDUI
 *     component key. If its value is in the derived universe it passes. If it
 *     is not, the file must DECLARE it in `DOC_TYPE_EXEMPTIONS` with a written
 *     reason naming the vocabulary it really belongs to. Anything else is red.
 *
 * Exemptions are keyed by (file, value), never by file alone and never by value
 * alone. A whole-file exemption would silence real defects on pages that mix
 * vocabularies — `api/schema-reference.md` carries `"type": "action"` (an
 * ActionSchema discriminant, exempted below) AND `"type": "card"` /
 * `"type": "table"` (registered component keys) in the same document, measured
 * on this tree — and a value-only exemption would let a
 * page anywhere in the tree teach `submit` as a component. (file, value) also
 * keeps the entry honest: it says which page speaks which dialect, which is the
 * fact a reader of that page needs.
 *
 * Every entry is re-derived per run. An entry whose file no longer contains
 * that value, or that carries no reason, fails as `stale-exemption` — an
 * exemption is worth what its evidence is worth, and one that outlives its site
 * widens the hole for the next snippet that lands there.
 *
 * ## Line numbers are reported, but the unit of judgment is the value
 *
 * A site is reported with `file:line` so the author can go straight to it, and
 * the exemption is keyed without the line so ordinary editing above a snippet
 * does not invalidate the table.
 *
 * ## The second surface: plugin key tables (objectui#5106)
 *
 * The rule above reads FENCED CODE ONLY, on purpose — prose that mentions a type
 * in backticks is not a snippet. That scope had a measured cost. The objectui#5002
 * family (PRs #5071 / #5078 / #5079 / #5085 / #5089 / #5093 / #5100 / #5104)
 * replaced a fictional "manual `*Components` registration loop" on eight plugin
 * pages with one canonical form — a markdown table of the keys the plugin's entry
 * really registers. The new form is the right one, and it landed entirely OUTSIDE
 * the scan surface, while the code blocks it replaced had been inside it. Net
 * effect: the fact "which keys does this plugin claim" moved from a checked place
 * to an unchecked one, guarded only by hand comparison.
 *
 * So key tables are now read, and the anchor is the TABLE HEADER, not the row:
 *
 *     | Namespaced key | Bare-name fallback | Renderer behind it |
 *
 * Anchoring on the header rather than pattern-matching rows is the whole design,
 * and it was chosen after measuring the alternative. The obvious row heuristic —
 * "first cell is a backticked token containing a colon, second cell is a
 * backticked token" — was run over this tree and matched 33 rows, of which only
 * 22 were keys. The other 11 are a `:`-bearing vocabulary this repo writes in
 * tables constantly:
 *
 *   guide/console-architecture.md:104   `/apps/:appName/:objectName` | `ObjectView`
 *   utilities/runner.mdx:99             `http://localhost:5173/`     | `LocalBundleLoader`
 *   guide/metadata-diagnostics.md:43    `GET /api/v1/meta/items/:type/:name?layered=true`
 *   guide/designing-app-navigation.md:21 `{ "type": "object", … }`
 *
 * React route patterns, URLs, HTTP routes and JSON literals — every one of them a
 * false RED on correct documentation, which is the expensive direction for a gate
 * whose whole job is to be trusted about docs. The header is a DECLARATION by the
 * page that the rows beneath it are registry keys, so it discriminates perfectly
 * where a row shape cannot, and it costs an author nothing they were not already
 * writing.
 *
 * Both halves of the row are judged, and judging the namespaced half is the point
 * objectui#5106 was filed for: this gate never judged a namespace at all. It
 * compared bare keys against a universe that happens to contain namespaced keys
 * too, so `view:dashboard` documented as `plugin-dashboard:dashboard` produced no
 * signal from any static check — the bare `dashboard` matched and the row passed.
 * Flip `namespace: 'view'` to `'dash'` in `plugin-dashboard/src/index.tsx` and
 * `deriveRegistryKeys` follows it live to `dash:dashboard`, while every doc that
 * teaches `view:dashboard` stays green. That is the hole; the namespaced cell
 * closes it.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT checked, and why: when the fallback cell reads
 * "none — `skipFallback: true`", this gate does not assert that the bare name is
 * absent from the universe. It cannot. The universe is a deliberate UNION across
 * every package in the repo (see "generous" above), so `view:grid` skipping its
 * own bare fallback says nothing about whether some other package registers a
 * bare `grid` — and one does. Asserting the negative would red
 * `plugins/plugin-grid.mdx:185`, which is correct. The positive half is checkable
 * and is checked; the negative half needs per-host registration modelling this
 * gate deliberately does not do.
 *
 * `DOC_TYPE_EXEMPTIONS` does not apply to table rows, and that is deliberate
 * rather than an omission. An exemption declares "this value belongs to another
 * vocabulary" — but a row under a header that says "Namespaced key" has already
 * declared its vocabulary, and there is no other one it could be. A row that
 * cannot be registered is a wrong row (or a header being borrowed for a table
 * that is not a key table), and both are worth fixing rather than silencing.

 * `typescript` fences, and `check-doc-fence-languages.mjs` labels every fence in
 * them (`join(pkgDir, entry, 'README.md')`). So a package README's `type`
 * literals are read twice and judged never — objectui#7115's geometry rebuilt one
 * directory over, on a surface that ships to npm inside each package's `files`.
 * objectui#7896 measured the gap two ways, and it still reproduces on
 * `59a3a233d`: a component `type` mutated in `packages/app-shell/README.md`
 * leaves this gate at `EXIT=0` with byte-identical counters, while the same
 * mutation in the root `README.md` gives `EXIT=1` at `README.md:272`. Identical
 * counters are the proof the file is not in the scan population at all, rather
 * than judged and forgiven.
 *
 * ⚠️ Why the leg is NOT here yet, and what has to happen first. The `domain:ui`
 * ruling on objectui#7896 orders this move census-first: a change that moves a
 * gate's scan population reports before it enforces, and the widening may land in
 * the same pull request ONLY if the census reads zero. It does not. Re-derived on
 * `c30026715` with this gate's own `deriveRegistryKeys`, fence walker and `type`
 * matcher over all 39 `packages/NAME/README.md`, the census read
 * **26 unregistered `type` literals across 8 files**, plus 4 blind spots (four
 * unquoted YAML scalars in `packages/data-objectstack/README.md:603-606`, an
 * object field-type vocabulary the same-line string-literal matcher cannot read).
 * That reading is DATED, not a live claim: it belongs to the commit named above,
 * and the instrument named beside it is how the next reader re-derives it rather
 * than inheriting it. It is written that way because the sentence it replaces was
 * not — it said `12 files`, a number contradicted by the per-file table of the
 * very census PR that landed it (#8111, 8 files with a non-zero column), and it
 * had already been quoted onward into objectui#8115's brief, which instructs its
 * implementer not to re-derive the census. A file COUNT is what a later reader
 * uses to judge whether a fix is complete, so `8 of 12` reads as unfinished work
 * that does not exist (objectui#8484). This is the same class objectui#7448 ruled
 * on one file over — a count in a header that nothing re-measures will rot — and
 * the same remedy `check-doc-fence-languages.mjs` already uses for its own census
 * (`273537957`: 83 files, 105 blocks): anchor the reading to a commit instead of
 * restating a bare number and restarting the clock.
 * Landing the leg today would turn `main` red on 26 sites this card is not
 * authorised to touch. Twenty-five of the 26 are other vocabularies with real declaration sites
 * — dashboard widget kinds (`DashboardRenderer.tsx`), flow-graph node kinds,
 * gesture kinds, Gantt task and dependency kinds, grid selection modes and
 * summary aggregates, report kinds, view actions and filter kinds — i.e.
 * candidate `DOC_TYPE_EXEMPTIONS` entries, each owed the reason that table
 * demands. One is a real defect of the shape this gate exists to catch:
 * `packages/plugin-detail/README.md:168` teaches a detail tab whose
 * `content.type` is `activity-timeline`, and that content goes through
 * `SchemaRenderer` (`DetailTabs.tsx:72`) while nothing registers that key — the
 * registry's `OBJUI-001` panel, the same failure as the `line-chart` widget
 * objectui#7896 recorded in `packages/plugin-dashboard/README.md`.
 *
 * ⛔ Do NOT reach for the exemption table to make a first run of the widened walk
 * green. `DOC_TYPE_EXEMPTIONS` records rulings, not a switch for turning red into
 * green, and stuffing it here would bury the one real defect among 25 entries
 * nobody read.
 *
 * ⚠️ And when the leg does land, it is not the precedent the ⛔ above refuses.
 * That ⛔ refuses widening onto an ARBITRARY unscanned tree;
 * `packages/NAME/README.md` is not one, it is the surface this gate's own two
 * siblings already walk, so the move aligns the third gate to its family rather
 * than reaching into a new tree. The distinction is the whole of the ruling, and
 * the ⛔ stays where it is.
 *
 * Two things the implementing change owes, recorded here so they are not
 * rediscovered: the leg belongs BEFORE the root pages in `scanDocs`, which is the
 * slot the two sibling walks append it in and what keeps the three lists
 * comparable element by element; and `check-doc-expression-carriage.mjs` IMPORTS
 * this file's surface constants and pins its own walk as an EQUALITY against a
 * walk rebuilt from them — that pin compares against the CONSTANTS, not against
 * this gate's actual walk, so a fourth leg added here alone leaves the pin GREEN
 * while the two surfaces silently diverge, which is objectui#7115's shape again.
 * The carriage census must take the same leg, and its `SURFACE_LABEL` test
 * enumerates every leg by name.

 * `register()`. That is why this looks for an assignment operator, a `delete`
 * or an `Object.assign` TARGET rather than for the property name.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is also POSITION-AGNOSTIC: a write spelled anywhere in the file

 *
 *   more than one COUNTED      a function-scoped `const` earlier in the file
 *   declaration                shadows the module-level one this call reads, so
 *                              the wrong object answers — a silent MISS. ⚠️ Two
 *                              positions are counted and no others; the
 *                              paragraph below states which.
 *   `let` / `var`              a binding initialised with a namespaced object
 *                              and reassigned to one without it still derived
 *                              the namespaced key. That is a PHANTOM: a key the
 *                              runtime never stores, blessed by the check.
 *   options written after      a `const` cannot be reassigned but its CONTENTS
 *                              can: assigning `meta.namespace`, deleting it, or
 *                              `Object.assign`-ing onto `meta` all move the keys
 *                              the registration publishes while the declaration
 *                              still reads the way it always did. Both
 *                              directions were measured — an added namespace is
 *                              a miss, a deleted one and an added
 *                              `skipFallback` are PHANTOMS.
 *
 * ⭐ The phantom is the worse direction and the reason these are refusals
 * rather than best efforts. A miss refuses a type that renders — expensive,
 * visible, and it argues for itself. A phantom green-lights a spelling that
 * renders NOTHING, and the author finds out in the browser.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS DOES NOT GUARD, stated because nothing here enforces it
 * (AGENTS #9), and stated as the COUNT'S OWN RULE rather than as a list of
 * binding kinds, because the list was the over-claim (objectui#9641 round 3).
 *
 * The count sees a name in exactly two positions: IMMEDIATELY AFTER the
 * keyword `const` / `let` / `var`, and inside an import clause. That is all.
 * A name reached any other way is not a binding as far as this is concerned,
 * so the module-level literal answers while the call passes a different
 * object — silently, with no finding. Measured and pinned as KNOWN GAP
 * readings in `check-doc-component-types.test.ts`: a FUNCTION PARAMETER of the
 * same name, a DESTRUCTURING pattern (object or array), a LATER DECLARATOR of
 * the same statement (`const first = 1, name = …`), and a `catch` binding.
 * All four are phantom-direction.
 *
 * Closing any of them needs scope analysis this regex-level derivation does not
 * do. ⛔ That is not a to-do list: the ruling on objectui#9641 (batch #150 item
 * 2, letter B) is that the reachable end state here is an accurate declaration
 * of what the instrument cannot see. The pins exist so that closing one later
 * fails a test rather than passing unnoticed.
 *
 * ⛔ NOTHING re-derives whether a site is shadowed by one of those bindings —
 * that is the gap itself, and no counter here should be read as covering it.
 * What IS re-derived every run is how many sites take the by-reference route at
 * all (`counters.metaViaReference`), which bounds how many sites the gap could
 * reach without saying that any of them is shadowed.

 * a call, a spread of any of those, a conditional spread and a computed
 * `namespace` were each measured resolving to a silent bare-only reading, which
 * is the same defect with a different spelling. None of them appears in this
 * tree today, so refusing them costs nothing here and is what lets the
 * regeneration script's header say, truthfully, that a form this cannot resolve
 * fails HERE rather than shrinking the universe there.
