/**
 * The surviving renderer's face IS a declared arm (objectui#7664, maintainer
 * ruling (a), 2026-09-05 — re-based on the 2026-09-09 family retirement).
 *
 * ## What objectui#8802 / objectui#8257 did to this file, and why it is a
 * rewrite rather than a deletion
 *
 * objectui#7664's ruling was about FOUR registered kanban keys and one shared
 * declaration: `'kanban'`, `'kanban-ui'`, `'kanban-enhanced'`, `'object-kanban'`.
 * Three of the four RETIRED on 2026-09-09 (objectui#8802 for the bare `kanban`
 * node key, objectui#8257 for the other two), and `KanbanSchema` — the dialect
 * this file was written to pin — retired with the first of them.
 *
 * ⛔ The claim objectui#7664 established did NOT retire with them: "the
 * registered renderer's props type-check against the declared schema, and the
 * declaration lives in `@object-ui/types` rather than being re-declared here."
 * That claim is now about ONE key, and this file asserts it about that key. The
 * legs that named a retired key moved to
 * `kanban-family-registry-keys-retired-8257.test.ts`, which owns the retirement
 * itself — including the anti-vacuity control that the surviving key is still
 * registered.
 *
 * ## The instrument
 *
 * Compile-time. Vitest strips types without checking them, so a green run of
 * this file proves nothing on its own; the assertions are read by
 * `tsc -p packages/plugin-kanban/tsconfig.test.json`, chained off this
 * package's `type-check` script. That project sets `"paths": {}`, so
 * `@object-ui/types` resolves through the workspace dependency to
 * `packages/types/dist/index.d.ts` — BUILD `@object-ui/types` before believing
 * either colour this file reports. The one runtime assertion — the surviving
 * registration exists — is the anti-vacuity control for the prop-type pins:
 * a prop type is only worth pinning for a renderer that is registered.
