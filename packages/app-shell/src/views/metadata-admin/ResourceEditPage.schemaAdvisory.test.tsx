/**
 * Pins the SAVE-GATE ASYMMETRY the editor is built on (objectui#6980).
 *
 * Two author-time error sources reach `ResourceEditPage`, and exactly one of
 * them gates Save:
 *
 *   - the scoped inspector's blocking issues (a CEL predicate that does not
 *     parse) — BLOCKING, because the server accepts that draft and publishing
 *     makes the malformed expression live (objectui#4306);
 *   - the live client Zod pass (`validateMetadataDraft`) — ADVISORY, because
 *     `saveMetaItem` runs the same contract and refuses the draft with a 422
 *     that `doSave` maps straight back into these same inline issues. The only
 *     failure the client can cause on its own is being STRICTER than the
 *     server, and that skew is real (objectstack#5316).
 *
 * From outside, "one of these blocks and the other doesn't" reads as a defect.
 * This suite exists so the asymmetry cannot be "fixed" by accident: adding
 * `issues.length` to the Save gate turns the first case below red.
 *
 * ## ⭐ The boundary, amended by objectui#8057 — read this before citing the above
 *
 * There is now a THIRD term in the Save gate, and it does block:
 *
 *     server-REFUSED   →  BLOCKS   (`refusalBlocking`, pinned by
 *                                   `ResourceEditPage.serverRefusalGate.test.tsx`)
 *     server-ACCEPTED  →  advisory (this suite, unchanged)
 *
 * That is not a narrowing of the ruling above, and the distinction is worth
 * getting right because the two are easy to conflate. Everything this suite
 * pins is about a verdict the client PREDICTS — and the reason it must not
 * block is spelled out in its own terms: the client may be STRICTER than the
 * server, so blocking would dead-bolt Save "on a draft the server accepts".
 * `refusalBlocking` is armed only by a 422 the server actually returned, so it
 * can never be armed by a draft the server accepts — there is no refusal to arm
 * it with. The dead-bolt this suite guards against stays unreachable, and no
 * prediction was promoted to a block.
 *
 * What objectui#8057 ended is narrower than it looks: the client used to
 * re-send a document the server had ALREADY refused, on every later edit,
 * reporting nothing — measured against a real 17.3.0 backend, where the
 * designer rendered a rename as applied while the server held none of it.
 *
 * ⛔ Neither suite may be cited without the other. A carve-out with only its
 * blocking half pinned is indistinguishable from having deleted this one.
 *
 * ## The fixture is the real skew shape, not a contrived one
 *
 * The stored page carries `zzServerOnlyKey` — a key the bundled
 * `@objectstack/spec` does not declare. That is objectstack#5316's exact shape
 * (a stored view carrying the platform's own `isPinned` / `sortOrder`), and it
 * is the class `clientValidation.ts`'s root-cure structurally cannot suppress:
 * the cure only drops TOP-LEVEL absent required fields (`path.length === 1`),
 * while `unrecognized_keys` arrives at `path.length === 0`. The mocked type
 * entry therefore hands the validator a MAXIMALLY LENIENT server schema
 * (`required: []` — a server that requires nothing at all) and the client
 * still rejects, which is the whole point: no server-schema hint can rescue
 * this class, so a blocking gate would dead-bolt Save on a draft the server
 * accepts.
 *
 * Stubbing mirrors `ResourceEditPage.celGate.test.tsx`: only the page CANVAS
 * is stubbed (to emit a selection) and the CEL engine is stubbed
 * deterministically. The Zod pass, the banner, the contract prop and this
 * host's real gating are all real.
