/**
 * Derives a workspace package's **build program** — the set of files the tools
 * its `build` script drives read in order to know what to produce.
 *
 * The fourth instance of the objectui#3514 class (objectui#4185), and the one
 * with the widest blast radius: `build` declared no `inputs` at all, and `build`
 * is the task whose `dist/` every other task consumes through
 * `dependsOn: ["^build"]`. A build replayed from a cache key that ignored a
 * `strict` flip in the root `tsconfig.json` hands stale `dist/` to everything
 * downstream.
 *
 * ## Why this derivation is a union rather than one walk
 *
 * `type-check` scripts are all tsc and `test` scripts are all Vitest, so each of
 * those guards derives one kind of program. `build` scripts are not uniform —
 * they are `&&` chains over five tools:
 *
 *     tsc                     14 packages      the tsc program (./tsc-program.ts)
 *     vite build              22 packages      the Vite config program
 *     tsup                     4 packages      the tsup config program + its tsconfig
 *     next build               1 app           the Next config program + its tsconfig
 *     node <script>            2 packages      the script and what it imports
 *     tsx <script>             (as node)       the script and what it imports
 *     pnpm <script>            1 app           the same package's other script
 *
 * So a segment is classified by the tool it runs, and each tool contributes
 * whatever IT reads. A segment running a command this module cannot classify
 * throws rather than being skipped: an unclassified segment is an unswept
 * program, and this guard's whole value is that it cannot quietly sweep
 * nothing.
 *
 * The relative-import walk over the resolved config files is the shared one in
 * `./config-program.ts`; the tsc side is the shared walker in `./tsc-program.ts`
 * that objectui#3514's guard also uses. What lives here is only which file each
 * tool starts from.
 *
 * ## Narrowings specific to this derivation
 *
 *  - A BUNDLER PLUGIN'S OWN FILE READS ARE NOT MODELLED. `vite-plugin-dts`
 *    builds a tsc program from the package's `tsconfig.json`, so a `vite build`
 *    package does transitively read the root tsconfig that one extends. Chasing
 *    that would mean reproducing each plugin's version-specific default for
 *    where its config lives — a derivation that drifts silently the next time a
 *    plugin changes its defaults, which is the failure mode of the thing being
 *    guarded. It is left out deliberately, and the cost is measured rather than
 *    assumed: turbo `inputs` are TASK-wide, not per-package, so an entry earned
 *    by one package covers the task for all of them — and
 *    `$TURBO_ROOT$/tsconfig.json` is earned many times over by the 14 packages
 *    whose build IS a tsc run. The narrowing changes which packages the guard
 *    NAMES, not which files the task hashes.
 *  - POSTCSS CONFIG DISCOVERY IS NOT MODELLED, and this one is a KNOWN BLIND
 *    SPOT rather than a safe narrowing, so it is written down here and filed
 *    (objectui#4198) rather than left for the next reader to rediscover. Vite
 *    hands CSS to `postcss-load-config`, which searches UPWARD from the Vite
 *    root — so a package that processes CSS through Vite and has no
 *    `postcss.config.*` of its own would read the nearest one ABOVE its
 *    directory, which this derivation neither walks nor hashes.
 *    NO SUCH FILE EXISTS TODAY: every tracked `postcss.config.*` sits inside
 *    the package that uses it, and the repo-root `postcss.config.mjs` that
 *    used to sit above them all was deleted by objectui#4065 (PR #4349), so
 *    the upward walk currently arrives at nothing. That retires the INSTANCE,
 *    not the gap — nothing in this derivation would notice the next config to
 *    appear at the root, or in any directory above a CSS-building package.
 *    Two further facts, both measured and both COINCIDENCES rather than
 *    structural guarantees, keep the walk short even if one did appear. Every
 *    vite-build package that processes CSS (`apps/console`,
 *    `packages/components`, `packages/runner`, the two console examples)
 *    carries its own postcss config, which stops the upward walk in its own
 *    directory; `packages/fields` is the only one without a config, and its
 *    single `src/index.css` never enters the Vite graph — nothing imports it,
 *    because `scripts/build-css.mjs` compiles it separately with an explicit
 *    plugin list. Both would have to hold for a re-introduced config to stay
 *    harmless: an `import './index.css'` added to `packages/fields/src`, plus
 *    any `postcss.config.*` above that package, would pull it into the build
 *    program, turbo would not hash it, and this guard would not notice.
 *  - NO FILE-VALUED OPTIONS. Unlike a Vitest config, nothing in this repo's
 *    build configs names a program file through a string literal: entries are
 *    spelled `resolve(__dirname, 'src/index.tsx')`, which is an expression, and
 *    every out-of-package reach is an `import` instead
 *    (`apps/console/vite.config.ts` importing the two `scripts/vite-*.ts`
 *    plugins). Declared explicitly, and empty, so the shared walker's
 *    key-directed designation rule is visibly a decision here.
 *  - A `pnpm --filter <pkg> build` SEGMENT IS A TASK-GRAPH FACT, NOT AN INPUTS
 *    FACT. The right answer to "this package's build needs that package's dist"
 *    is turbo's `dependsOn: ["^build"]`, not a `$TURBO_ROOT$` glob over another
 *    package's source. So delegations are collected and returned rather than
 *    walked. NO PACKAGE DELEGATES TODAY (objectui#7292 deleted the last two:
 *    `packages/components` hand-listed types/core/react in a `prebuild` while
 *    its real closure was seven packages, and `apps/site` named the schema
 *    catalog it already declares as a dependency), and
 *    `../turbo-build-inputs.test.ts` now RATCHETS that to zero rather than
 *    policing the survivors: a hand-written list of a package's own build
 *    closure is a second, unchecked copy of its `dependencies`, and the
 *    collected `delegations` are what makes re-introducing one fail loudly.
