/**
 * The `page-header` alias declares only keys `@objectstack/spec` declares
 * (objectui#3226).
 *
 * The legacy kebab key `page-header` and the canonical protocol key
 * `page:header` (in `@object-ui/components`) render the same concept, but this
 * one used to DECLARE a different authorable key for the secondary line:
 * `description`, where the spec's `PageHeaderProps` — and therefore
 * `page:header` — declares `subtitle`. That is not a tolerated legacy spelling,
 * it is a second dialect published on the declaration surface: `inputs` is what
 * the designer offers as fields and what the framework's
 * `check:react-declaration-parity` diffs against the spec schemas, so an author
 * (especially an AI one) was being TOLD `description` was legal. Metadata that
 * took the offer renders a subtitle under `page-header` and silently loses it
 * under `page:header` — the same JSON, two results, which is the failure mode
 * one contract exists to prevent.
 *
 * The cross-check below is deliberately derived from the spec's own shape
 * rather than a hand-written allowlist: a future input added here that the spec
 * does not declare fails for the same reason `description` did, without anyone
 * having to remember this issue.
 *
 * SEQUENCING — SETTLED (objectui#3789). This file used to end with two tests
 * pinning the runtime `subtitle ?? description` read, because the alias existed
 * precisely for out-of-repo consumer schemas: "no in-repo author writes
 * `description`" (true, verified) said nothing about whether anyone does, and
 * dropping the read while metadata still carried the key would have deleted an
 * external page's second line while its title kept rendering — the least
 * reportable failure there is. The gate was a measurement, not a date: every
 * spec-valid position a `page-header` node can occupy had to be shown to pass
 * through a loader that performs the ADR-0087 D2 rewrite
 * `page-header-subtitle-alias` (`description` → `subtitle`). It did not, twice:
 * the conversion walker reached only `regions[].components[]`
 * (objectstack#6775). After objectstack#6776 (slots) and PR #7034 (containers
 * nested to any depth), all seven positions convert — re-measured against the
 * spec build this repo consumes — so the read and its two pins were deleted in
 * the same change. The measurement itself did not go away with them: it is a
 * standing pin in `page-header-subtitle-conversion-coverage.test.ts`, which goes
 * red if that reach ever narrows again.
 *
 * TOMBSTONES — objectui#3829. "Derived from the spec's own shape" was doing less
 * work than it read as. `Object.keys(shape)` reports a key whether the spec
 * ACCEPTS it or REJECTS it by name: an ADR-0087 D2 retirement replaces the
 * member with `z.never()` and leaves the entry in place. So when
 * @objectstack/spec 17.0.0 retired `PageHeaderProps.icon` (objectstack#6946 /
 * PR objectstack#7115), every assertion here that consulted the derived key set
 * went on passing for `icon` — describing a spec key that no longer exists. The
 * derivation now skips tombstones, and the two facts the old reading conflated
 * are stated separately: `actions` is declared because the spec owns it, `icon`
 * is declared because THIS renderer draws it (the canonical `page:header` never
 * did, which is why upstream retired the key at all). The carve-out is a named,
 * issue-backed, self-clearing list rather than a silent pass — see
 * `RENDERER_OWN_DECLARED`.
 *
 * THE JUDGE IS SHARED NOW — objectui#3809, and this file's own note asked for it
 * ("the criterion here is deliberately the same one objectui#3809 converges on
 * repo-wide; when that lands, this local helper is what it replaces"). The local
 * `z.never()` probe is gone, replaced by `@object-ui/test-support`'s. Three
 * things change with it, none of them a loosening:
 *
 *   - the same criterion now serves the repo-wide parity gate
 *     (`apps/console/src/__tests__/registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts`), where
 *     its absence was a live FALSE GREEN in one direction and a FALSE RED in the
 *     other. This file had the fix and could not lend it — that is what a copied
 *     judgement costs;
 *   - recognition gained a second channel (the `[REMOVED]` marker `retiredKey()`
 *     stamps on the description), OR-ed with the structural one, so a Zod
 *     internals rework can no longer silently turn the probe permissive;
 *   - the probe is calibrated once, centrally, against what the contract's own
 *     `safeParse` actually rejects — `packages/test-support/src/__tests__/
 *     spec-tombstones.test.ts`. The local non-vacuity test below is KEPT anyway:
 *     it pins this file's own subject (`icon` retired, `title` live), which no
 *     amount of central calibration can state.
