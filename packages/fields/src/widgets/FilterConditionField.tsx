 * sibling `object_name` field.
 *
 * Reached via the field `widget: 'filter-condition'` hint (resolves as
 * `field:filter-condition`). Reads the live `object_name` from
 * `dependentValues`, loads that object's fields via
 * `dataSource.getObjectSchema(...)`, and renders `<FilterBuilder>` over them —
 * so an admin builds `type == "customer" AND is_active == true` by picking
 * fields/operators instead of hand-writing JSON.
 *
 * Storage contract: the value round-trips as a **MongoDB-style object filter**
 * (`{ field: value }`, `{ field: { $gt: n } }`, `{ $or: [...] }`), JSON-encoded
 * — the exact shape the sharing evaluator spreads into `engine.find(object,
 * { filter })`. Criteria that can't be represented in the builder (nested
 * mixes, unknown operators) fall back to a raw-JSON editor so nothing is hidden
 * or lost; an "Edit as JSON" toggle is always available.

  /**
   * The builder's ROWS, held here — not projected from the stored criteria.
   *
   * objectui#8748. This widget is a controlled round-trip: it emits
   * `filterGroupToMongo(rows)` and reads the rows back out of the value it just
   * emitted. That was survivable only while every row round-tripped. Since the
   * same change makes `condToMongo` DROP a text row whose value box is still
   * empty, a projected row deletes itself: switching a row's operator to any of
   * `contains` / `icontains` / `not_contains` / `starts_with` /
   * `ends_with` emits no fragment, the criteria goes back to empty, and
   * `FilterBuilder` — which re-seeds its internal rows whenever the incoming
   * `value` differs from them — drops the row before a comparand can be typed.
   * Measured: those five operators were unreachable through this UI, except by
   * typing the value under `equals` first.
   *
   * So the rows are state and the stored criteria is what they EMIT. The drop
   * stays where it belongs — at emission — and an unfinished row stays on
   * screen, which is also what the `criteriaRequired` hint below is for.
   *
   * Re-seeded only by an OUTSIDE change: an incoming criteria that is no longer
   * what these rows emit (a different record, the raw-JSON editor, a form
   * reset). A parent that ignores what this widget emits is that same case by
   * construction — the stored value stays authoritative — which is the one
   * behaviour this keeps from the projection it replaces.
