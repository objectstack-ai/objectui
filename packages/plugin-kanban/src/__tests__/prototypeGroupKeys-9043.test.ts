/**
 * objectui#9043 — `bucketCardsIntoColumns` built its two lookup maps as
 * prototype-bearing object literals and then keyed them from RECORD DATA.
 *
 * ## The mechanism
 *
 * No schema guards these keys: `@objectstack/spec` narrows the lane `id`
 * (objectui#8913), not the values stored in the grouped field. Imported legacy
 * data, a free-text status field, or a picklist option whose stored value is a
 * member name of `Object.prototype` all reach the maps, and a `{}` map answers
 * such a key from the prototype instead of from what the function stored:
 *
 * - **The label map read** is `labelToColumnId[rawKey.toLowerCase()] ?? rawKey`.
 *   `??` only falls back on null/undefined, so an INHERITED member is returned
 *   as if it were a declared lane id, and the record is grouped under whatever
 *   that member stringifies to.
 * - **The label map write** is `labelToColumnId['__proto__'] = col.id`, which on
 *   a prototype-bearing object invokes the `__proto__` setter and is silently
 *   ignored for a string — a lane declared with that option value loses its
 *   mapping entirely.
 * - **The accumulator** does `if (!acc[key]) acc[key] = []; acc[key].push(...)`.
 *   `acc['toString']` is the inherited METHOD, which is truthy, so the array is
 *   never created and `.push` is called on a function. Thrown during render, so
 *   the user sees a blank board or an error boundary with nothing naming the
 *   offending record.
 * - **The injection read** `groups[col.id] || []` is the same map a third time:
 *   for a lane declared `{ id: '__proto__' }` it answers `Object.prototype`,
 *   which is truthy and then spreads as "not iterable".
 *
 * Measured on `main` before the repair (`61afb87`), lanes `[{id:'a',title:'A'}]`,
 * one record — the crash leg and the mis-bucket leg split on the `.toLowerCase()`
 * in the label-map read, since `'toString'` lowercases to `'tostring'`, which is
 * NOT an inherited member, while `'constructor'` and `'__proto__'` already are:
 *
 *     'ordinary_value' -> a:, __uncolumned__:r1            (clean — the control)
 *     'toString'       -> THREW TypeError: acc[key].push is not a function
 *     'valueOf'        -> THREW  (same)
 *     'hasOwnProperty' -> THREW  (same)
 *     'constructor'    -> a:, __uncolumned__:r1  — but grouped under the key
 *                         "function Object() { [native code] }"
 *     '__proto__'      -> a:, __uncolumned__:r1  — grouped under "[object Object]"
 *
 * ## What each row is for
 *
 * 1. CONTROLS — an ordinary value, matched by id, matched by label, and matched
 *    by nothing. Green on BOTH sides of the repair. They are what make the rows
 *    below statements about prototype member names rather than about bucketing
 *    in general, and they are what separates a repair from a bucketer that
 *    simply dropped everything: "nothing threw" is satisfied by both.
 * 2. THE CRASH LEG — `toString` / `valueOf` / `hasOwnProperty`. Each asserts
 *    WHICH LANE the record lands in, not merely that nothing threw.
 * 3. THE MIS-BUCKET LEG — `constructor` / `__proto__`. ⚠️ These two were already
 *    green at the LANE level before the repair (the table above): the label map
 *    returned an inherited member, and the nonsense group key it produced still
 *    matched no lane, so the record still fell into the trailing lane. They are
 *    pinned because they are the reported readings; rows 4-6 are what make the
 *    label map's defect observable in the return value.
 * 4. DECLARED LANES — the picklist case, where the SAME option value produces
 *    both the lane and the records. All three threw before the repair; each now
 *    asserts the record reaches its declared lane, which is the reading the two
 *    rows above cannot make.
 * 5. NOTHING IS DROPPED (#2792) — the fence this repair must not trade away. A
 *    board carrying every offending value at once renders each record exactly
 *    once. Rows 2-4 would all pass if such records were discarded instead of
 *    bucketed, and that would swap a visible crash for a silent loss.
