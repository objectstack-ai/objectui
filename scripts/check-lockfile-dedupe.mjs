 *
 * The committed `pnpm-lock.yaml` must already be DEDUPED: running
 * `pnpm dedupe` on it may not collapse anything (objectui#8333).
 *
 *   Run:  node scripts/check-lockfile-dedupe.mjs             (`pnpm check:lockfile-dedupe`)
 *         node scripts/check-lockfile-dedupe.mjs --report-only  (what CI passes)
 *         node scripts/check-lockfile-dedupe.mjs --self-test
 *
 * ## `--report-only`: the gate REPORTS on pull requests (objectui#9562)
 *
 * objectui#9562 measured this gate returning four green and one red on a
 * byte-identical `pnpm-lock.yaml` inside ninety minutes, the red printing a
 * confident `VERDICT not deduped` that no lockfile edit and no registry publish
 * explained — and then instructing the reader to commit a dedupe the tree did
 * not need, to a lockfile every open pull request shares. The maintainer ruled
 * (2026-09-17, letter A) that a gate which is non-deterministic by construction
 * does not BLOCK:
 *
 *   - `--report-only` keeps every reading exactly as it is and changes only what
 *     the process does with it: annotations become `::warning::`, the same text
 *     is written to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, and the process exits 0. It is the
 *     flag `lockfile-dedupe.yml` passes.
 *   - The BARE script keeps its exit codes — 0 / 1 / 2 — for whoever runs it by
 *     hand. ⛔ That is deliberate and not an oversight to tidy away: the hard
 *     verdict is still how a human asks this question.
 *   - ⛔ Report-only may never flatten the three answers into two. `clean` and
 *     `cannot-run` both exit 0 under the flag, so the EXIT CODE no longer tells
 *     them apart — the annotation does, and `cannot-run` carries one precisely
 *     because of that. A report-only mode that cannot say "I could not look" is
 *     worse than the blocking gate it replaces.
 *   - The finding text, in BOTH modes, now says what the instrument is: re-run
 *     before acting, and dedupe only when the split reproduces. ⛔ The old
 *     unconditional "fix it HERE by running `pnpm dedupe` and committing the
 *     lockfile" is gone from both — it is the sentence objectui#9562 reported.
 *
 * ## What this is for, and why it is not objectui#8326's gate
 *
 * objectui#8326's `check-lockfile-integrity.mjs` reports a DELTA: it compares a
 * pull request's lockfile with its merge base and names anything that gained a
 * physical copy. It answers "did THIS change duplicate something?".
 *
 * This gate answers a different question, about one tree and no base: "is the
 * lockfile in a state where `pnpm dedupe` would still have work to do?" The two
 * are independent — a tree can be delta-clean and still carry years of
 * accumulated duplication, which is exactly the state `main` was in until
 * objectui#9215 collapsed 47 identities out of it.
 *
 * ## The defect this closes, in the order it happens
 *
 * 1. A dependency bump re-resolves part of the peer graph and forks a package
 *    that was single-copy. Measured on objectui#8333: bumping `better-auth`
 *    alone splits `zod` into a third physical copy and pulls `@objectstack/spec`
 *    and `ai` into a second peer context each. No declaration, range or override
 *    anywhere in the workspace changed — it is partial-re-resolution debt.
 * 2. `Bundle Analysis` then reads a bundle that grew, and the growth is
 *    attributed to the bump. It is not the bump: it is the fork.
 * 3. The remedy is `pnpm dedupe`. But `pnpm dedupe` is NOT SURGICAL — it
 *    collapses every collapsible duplicate in the tree, not just the one the
 *    bump created. Run inside a bump PR on a tree carrying old duplication, it
 *    drags all of that along, and the reviewer reads the combined delta as the
 *    bump's. That is the SAME misattribution, aimed at a different PR.
 *
 * ⇒ requiring the remedy is only honest once the tree is already deduped. That
 * is why objectui#8333's ruling was "B then A": pay the accumulated debt down in
 * its own dedicated pull request FIRST (objectui#9215, landed), and only then
 * require the remedy in bump PRs. This gate is the second half, and its whole
 * value depends on the first half staying true — which is precisely what it
 * enforces. Without it `main` drifts back to a duplicated tree and the next bump
 * PR's dedupe is expensive and unreadable again.
 *
 * ## Why the verdict is pnpm's exit code and not a parse of its output
 *
 * `pnpm dedupe --check` is pnpm's own contract: exit 0 when nothing would
 * change, non-zero when something would. This gate does not re-derive that. It
 * reads the exit code, and parses the output ONLY to NAME the packages in the
 * annotation. A parse that finds nothing still reds on a non-zero exit — the
 * names are a convenience and can never change the verdict, so a future change
 * to pnpm's report format degrades the message and not the judgement.
 *
 * The one thing the output IS load-bearing for is telling a FINDING apart from a
 * CRASH. Both exit non-zero, and "the registry was unreachable" is not a finding
 * about the diff. So a non-zero exit counts as a finding only when the output
 * carries pnpm's own remedy sentinel; otherwise this exits 2, "could not take a
 * reading", which is never a pass.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ This gate reads the REGISTRY, unlike its neighbour
 *
 * `check-lockfile-integrity.mjs` is one `node` call over two text files.
 * This one shells out to pnpm, which resolves against `registry.npmjs.org`, so
 * it costs a network round trip and can fail for reasons that are about the
 * world rather than the diff. That failure lands on exit 2 (see above) with a
 * message saying so, rather than being reported as a lockfile finding.
 *
 * ⚠️ Stated because it bounds what the green means: `pnpm dedupe` does NOT chase
 * the newest version admitted by a range — it only collapses copies that are
 * already in the tree. Measured on objectui#8333: `better-auth` is declared
 * `^1.7.2` and locked at `1.7.2` while the registry already serves `1.7.4`,
 * which that range admits, and this gate is green on that tree. So a publish to
 * the registry does not by itself turn this gate red, and it is not the
 * spontaneously-drifting check that a "resolve against the live registry" gate
 * sounds like. That is an argument from one measured instance plus pnpm's
 * documented behaviour, ⛔ not a proof over all future pnpm versions; the
 * instrument that re-derives it is this gate's own run history.
