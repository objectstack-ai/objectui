/**
 * The `marketplace` and `preview` namespaces — objectui#3546 slice five —
 * resolve **from the locale packs, with a provider mounted**.
 *
 * ## What was broken, precisely
 *
 * `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` (#3530's gate) measured **37 distinct
 * keys at 37 call sites** under `marketplace.*` / `preview.*` that a `t()` call
 * site asks for and that NO pack defined, plus **one** `missing-prefix` family
 * (`marketplace.disclosure.runtime.`, whose static head matched no `en` key at
 * all so every expansion missed). Unlike slices two through four this slice has
 * no multi-site key: the denominator is 1:1 — still measured, never counted by
 * hand, because slice two predicted 90 and the truth was 93.
 *
 * All 37 carried an inline `t(key, { defaultValue: 'English' })`, so this is the
 * milder objectui#3517 class: English rendered correctly and **all ten
 * languages were stuck on it**. Nothing rendered a raw key here — slice one
 * (PR #3583) held the sites that did — and an AST sweep of the whole
 * `marketplace.*`/`preview.*` call-site surface (172 sites in 11 files, not just
 * this slice's 37) found 16 dead `t(key) || 'English'` fallbacks, every one of
 * them on a key that already resolves in `en` and NOT in this slice, so this
 * slice touches no component. (They are filed; see the PR body.)
 *
 * Consequence for test design, same as slices two through four: `en` output was
 * already correct before the change, so **an `en` assertion cannot discriminate
 * before from after**. Every assertion that pins the fix is a non-`en` one; the
 * `en` cases only prove the key is reachable through the real binding.
 *
 * ## The template-key family
 *
 * `marketplace.disclosure.runtime.` is the plugin trust tier badge in
 * `PluginDisclosure.tsx:70`:
 *
 *     t(`marketplace.disclosure.runtime.${version.runtime}`, {
 *       defaultValue: RUNTIME_FALLBACK[version.runtime],
 *     })
 *
 * Its value surface is a CLOSED enumeration — `PluginRuntimeSchema` in
 * objectstack `packages/spec/src/kernel/manifest.zod.ts` is
 * `z.enum(['node', 'sandbox', 'worker'])` (ADR-0025 §3.6) — so the repair is an
 * enumeration of three members, not a wildcard, and the family leaves
 * `missingPrefixes` (3 → 2). The in-repo authority this test reads is the
 * component's own `RUNTIME_FALLBACK` map, which is what `defaultValue` reads; a
 * fourth tier added to either side fails the test, which is the job the prefix
 * entry used to do.
 *
 * **Repointed by objectui#3846.** When this file was written the map was a
 * `Record< string, string >` and the spec — living in a sibling repo — was
 * unreadable from here, so "the component's own map" was the only authority
 * available. The map is keyed by the spec's `PluginRuntime` now, and the
 * value-level comparison against `PluginRuntimeSchema.options` itself lives in
 * `packages/app-shell/src/console/marketplace/__tests__/plugin-runtime-tier-3846.test.tsx`
 * — app-shell depends on `@objectstack/spec`, `@object-ui/i18n` deliberately does
 * not (its dependencies are `@object-ui/core` + i18next, and a test-only spec
 * dependency would be the first). So this file keeps doing what it can prove
 * from here — that the PACKS and the label map agree, member for member — and
 * additionally pins that the map is keyed by the spec's type rather than by
 * `string`, which is what makes the two files one chain instead of two truths.
 *
 * ## Why a provider is mounted
 *
 * All five components behind these keys — `MarketplacePage`,
 * `MarketplacePackagePage`, `PluginDisclosure`, `CommitTimeline` and
 * `UnpublishedAppBar` — bind `t` from a bare `useObjectTranslation()`. None sits
 * behind a `createSafeTranslation` defaults map, so there is no provider-less
 * path to be green on: without `I18nProvider`, i18next is not the thing
 * answering and the test would describe a binding the console never uses.
