/**
 * objectui#8408 — the public form `/f/:slug` renders its authored `title` and
 * `description`, not the object API name.
 *
 * ## What this reproduces, in the DOM
 *
 * The card was found taking release screenshots of a real app on this Console
 * (`objectstack-ai/ats`, ats#59): a member of the public opening the one
 * anonymous Console surface was greeted by a database table name.
 * `GET /api/v1/forms/apply` served the authored copy intact —
 * `{"object":"ats_inquiry","form":{"title":"Apply","description":"…"}}` — and
 * the page rendered `ats_inquiry` as its `<h1>` and nothing at all where the
 * description belongs. The fixture below IS that payload.
 *
 * Two independent reads were broken, and each leg here is written against the
 * one that a half-fix leaves standing:
 *
 *   1. `loadPublicForm`'s chain was `payload.label ?? payload.form?.label ??
 *      payload.object`. Every arm missed but the last: this endpoint sends no
 *      envelope `label`, and `form.label` is a key `@objectstack/spec`'s
 *      `FormViewSchema` REJECTS (`unrecognized_keys`) — a form config says
 *      `title`. So the one real, typed, populated key naming the form was the
 *      only one never read.
 *   2. The subtitle slot read `form.label` under `form.label !== loaded.label`,
 *      which is DEAD on this route in BOTH directions (no `payload.label` =>
 *      `loaded.label` IS `form.label` => inequality false; `payload.label`
 *      present => `form.label` undefined). `description` had exactly one
 *      occurrence in the whole 2 000-line file, inside a prose comment.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Which leg discriminates, said out loud
 *
 * `HEADING_IS_THE_AUTHORED_TITLE` alone does NOT close this card: a fix that
 * adds a `title` arm to the chain and leaves the dead subtitle predicate
 * standing satisfies it completely, and the author's sentence stays on the
 * floor. `DESCRIPTION_REACHES_THE_DOM` is the leg that fails under that
 * half-fix — it is the one that judges the predicate REPLACEMENT the card
 * asked for rather than a second condition stacked beside it.
 *
 * Conversely `DESCRIPTION_REACHES_THE_DOM` alone is satisfied by a renderer
 * that prints the description and still titles the page `ats_inquiry`. The two
 * legs are independent defects and neither subsumes the other, so both are
 * asserted against concrete authored strings, never against "something
 * non-empty".
 *
 * `API_NAME_IS_NOWHERE_IN_THE_HEADER` is the third: it fails a fix that adds
 * the title while leaving the API name rendered somewhere beside it, which no
 * presence assertion can see.
 *
 * ## ⛔ What this file does NOT pin, on purpose
 *
 * i18n. The section heading is still rendered raw on this route and this card
 * does not change that — it is the second seam, tracked separately, and
 * asserting a translated string HERE would assert it on a harness rather than
 * on the route (`useSafeFieldLabel` degrades to identity functions instead of
 * throwing, so such an assertion can pass without measuring anything). The
 * legs below are all server-supplied strings, which is exactly what this route
 * renders today and after this card.
