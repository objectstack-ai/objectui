/**
 * The pin on the coverage shard leg's reporter set (objectui#9177).
 *
 * ## What this guards, and why nothing else could
 *
 * `ci.yml`'s `test-coverage` job runs vitest four ways in parallel and merges
 * the four blob reports in the job below it, which is where the configured
 * coverage thresholds are enforced. A CLI `--reporter` **replaces** the
 * reporter set rather than adding to it, and vitest's resolution is:
 *
 *     if (!resolved.reporters.length) {
 *       resolved.reporters.push([isAgent ? "agent" : "default", {}]);
 *       if (process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS === "true")
 *         resolved.reporters.push(["github-actions", {}]);
 *     }
 *
 * so `--reporter=blob` on its own displaced BOTH halves of that pair. A red
 * shard's log then ended at `blob report written to …` — no failing test name,
 * no assertion text, no timeout message — and the shard job's only annotation
 * was the generic `Process completed with exit code 1.` The failures survived
 * only inside the `coverage-blob-N` artifact, which is download-only.
 *
 * objectui#8545 measured what that costs: two episodes in which one test file
 * held `main`'s coverage gate unevaluated for **84** and **87** consecutive
 * pushes, both found the same way — a person reading a job log by hand, days
 * later.
 *
 * Nothing else in this repository reads what that step runs.
 * `ci-cd-pipeline-doc.test.ts` pins the pairing between `ci.yml` and the
 * pipeline page, but it compares COMMANDS, not flags — its extractor is
 *
 *     for (const m of text.matchAll(/\bpnpm\s+([\w:.-]+)/g)) {
 *       if (rootScripts.has(m[1])) found.add(`pnpm ${m[1]}`);
 *     }
 *
 * whose capture stops at the first space, so `pnpm test:coverage` is all it
 * ever sees. Every flag on that line could be deleted and that file stays
 * green.
 *
 * ## Both directions, because the failure has two shapes
 *
 * Dropping `--reporter=default` / `--reporter=github-actions` restores
 * objectui#9177. Dropping `--reporter=blob` to "simplify" the line is the same
 * defect wearing the other hat: the merge job loses the only input it has, so
 * a readable failure is bought with an unevaluated coverage floor
 * (objectui#5403). Neither is caught by CI going green, because the shard leg
 * passing is exactly the state in which nobody looks at its log.
 *
 * ⛔ If you are deleting this file, you are deleting the only mechanical guard
 * on that reporter set. The measurement behind it is in the ⚠️ comment above
 * the step in `ci.yml`; re-run it before you change the line.

 * lines and a regex over the file would have to re-implement the folding to see
 * the command the runner actually executes. Matching on `test:coverage` rather
 * than on the full string is what makes a rewrite FAIL here instead of
 * vanishing — a pin that searched for today's exact line would simply stop
