/**
 * Which record fields a view's PREDICATES read — the half of a view's field
 * appetite that is not its columns.
 *
 * A list view projects what it DISPLAYS: `$select` is built from the column
 * list (plus `id` and the expanded relation roots). That is correct for
 * rendering and wrong for gating, because a `visible` / `disabled` /
 * conditional-formatting predicate reads fields nobody put on screen — gating a
 * row action on `record.owner` while showing Title / Status is the ordinary
 * case, not an exotic one.
 *
 * The field then simply is not in the payload, and CEL does not treat an absent
 * key as null: `record.owner == os.user.id` FAULTS with `No such key: owner`.
 * Fault handling differs per surface and both answers are wrong — fail-CLOSED
 * on the row kebab and the selection bar (the button silently disappears for
 * everyone), fail-OPEN on the lenient paths (it appears for everyone). Nothing
 * in either outcome points at a projection.
 *
 * Harvesting the names a predicate mentions and adding them to `$select` is
 * what closes that. Note what it deliberately does NOT add: `$expand`. A
 * predicate wants the stored foreign key, which is exactly what an unexpanded
 * relation column already is — so a predicate-only relation field costs one
 * more column and no extra round trip. (A relation that IS displayed still gets
 * expanded for its label, and `toPredicateRecord` collapses it back for the
 * predicate.)
 *
 * Since objectstack#8018 the same reader also carries the non-predicate row keys
 * a view's actions read: `recordIdField`, and since objectui#10277 the field a
 * `defaultFromRow` param seeds from and the `{field}` tokens of an action's
 * `target`. The name kept the "predicate" spelling because the mechanism is
 * identical (harvest a name, gate it against the declared fields, add it to
 * `$select`); see {@link listViewPredicates} for what is in the set and why.

 * `record.owner_id == os.user.id` — names one of them. Checking a harvested
 * name against the declared fields alone would drop it, leaving the predicate
 * with the same missing key the harvest exists to prevent.
 *
 * Deliberately the columns OBSERVED on a live payload rather than
 * `SYSTEM_MANAGED_FIELD_NAMES` (`@object-ui/types`), which is the broader
 * DISPLAY-oriented set and carries legacy aliases (`_id`, `createdAt`,
 * `modified`, `space`) that are not columns anywhere. An alias in `$select` is

/**
 * Every record-field reference a list-ish view carries, flattened for
 * {@link collectPredicateFieldRefs}.
 *
 * One reader so the projection cannot fall behind the surfaces: each entry here
 * is a place a row field is actually READ — conditional formatting, the row
 * kebab (custom defs AND the built-in Edit/Delete overrides), the selection bar,
 * and the object's declared actions.
 *
 * Most entries are predicates. Four are not, and all are spelled as a synthetic
 * `record.<name>` so the one harvester handles them: conditional formatting's
 * native `{ field, operator, value }` shape, an action's `recordIdField`
 * (objectstack#8018), the field each `defaultFromRow` param seeds from, and each
 * `{field}` token of the action's `target` (both objectui#10277). The
 * `recordIdField` case is the same *class* of bug the predicate harvest exists
 * to close, one surface over — the action runtime reads
 * `rowRecord[action.recordIdField]` to seed `recordIdParam`, so a key outside the
 * listView columns arrived absent and the injection was silently skipped, which
 * turns a record-scoped mutation into one that names no record while still
 * reporting success. The default (`id`) is already projected unconditionally, so
 * only an explicit declaration adds anything here.
 *
 * The last two are the same class again, and they were silent in the same way.
 * `resolveActionParam` seeds a `defaultFromRow` param only when the row HAS the
 * key (an own-property check), so an absent key opened the param dialog with the
 * field blank; and the console's `api` handler fills a `{field}` token from the
 * row, so an absent key put an empty path segment into the URL. The key a param
 * seeds from is `field ?? name` — the runtime's precedence, not the param's
 * payload name — and the token grammar is the handler's own. Neither is
 * narrowed by the action's `type`, for the asymmetry stated below: an extra
 * column costs bytes.
 *
 * A `recordIdField` or param key that is not a bare identifier is dropped here
 * (a `target` token is one by construction of its grammar), and a name the
 * object does not declare is dropped by the caller's `isProjectableField`
 * guard. Both drops are the safe direction: such a name is not a column
 * anywhere, and an unknown key in `$select` is not ignored by every backend.
 * The identifier gate is not decoration — without it the harvester's regex would
 * read a PREFIX of a malformed name (`record.not a field` → `not`) and
 * contribute a plausible wrong field instead of nothing.
 *
 * ⛔ Harvesting is not a read grant. Every name here is a CANDIDATE: each
 * consumer still passes it through its own field-level read filter before it
 * reaches `$select`, so a field the principal may not read is not requested
 * because an action names it.
 *
 * `objectActions` is deliberately the object's WHOLE action set rather than
 * only the ones this view promotes. Narrowing it would mean re-running the
 * name resolution `resolveLegacyRowActions` / `resolveBulkActions` already do,
 * at a point in the fetch where the view's `rowActions` / `bulkActions` lists
 * have not been folded yet — and the two directions of error are not
 * symmetric: an extra column costs bytes, a missing one silently breaks the
 * predicate that needed it.
