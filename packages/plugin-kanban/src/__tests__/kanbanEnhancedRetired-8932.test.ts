/**
 * objectui#8932 — `KanbanEnhanced.tsx` is DELETED from `@object-ui/plugin-kanban`.
 *
 * The module was reachable through no entry of this package's `exports` map
 * (`.` and `./style.css` only) and re-exported by no barrel, and once the
 * `kanban-enhanced` registry key retired (objectui#8257) nothing but two test
 * files referred to it. Ruled delete (2026-09-11, ratified by the maintainer
 * 2026-09-24): published source that nothing can reach is removed, rather than
 * given an export nobody asked for or left for the next reader to re-measure.
 * ⛔ If a richer board is ever wanted, it comes back as a feature of the one
 * registered board (`KanbanImpl`), not as a second implementation beside it.
 *
 * Two halves, each with a firing control on the same instrument:
 *
 *   - the file is absent from `src/`, while `KanbanImpl.tsx` in the same
 *     directory reads present;
 *   - no file under `src/` names the retired module as a module specifier — a
 *     static or dynamic import, a re-export, a `require`, or a `vi.mock` /
 *     `vi.doMock` target — while the same pattern over the same walk finds the
 *     live board's lazy import in `index.tsx`.
 *
 * ⚠️ Mock targets count on purpose. A mock registered against a path that no
 * longer exists fails nothing, so it would outlive the module silently; one of
 * the two references this deletion found was exactly that shape.
