/**
 * LocaleSwitcher
 *
 * Dropdown menu for switching the application language.
 * Uses the i18n context to change language at runtime.
 *
 * The menu is not a list of its own (objectui#4039): it renders whatever the
 * i18n provider says is offerable — the app's own locale list ∩ what the
 * renderer can resolve. This file owns only the *labels*, because the native
 * names of the built-in packs are the one piece of that no API supplies:
 * `GET /api/v1/i18n/locales` returns descriptors whose `label` is the code
 * echoed back (`toLocaleDescriptors` in @objectstack/spec), so a server label
 * would put `th` in the menu where `ไทย` belongs.
 *
 * It is also not a device-local setting any more (objectui#10059). A switch made
 * while signed in writes `sys_user.locale` — the column the profile page's
 * language card already writes — so the two controls are two faces of one
 * stored value instead of two settings sharing one word. `useLanguageSelection`
 * owns that; this file owns the menu.
