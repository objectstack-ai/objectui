/**
 * A gated lookup names its controlling field by LABEL — objectstack#5407.
 *
 * The gate sentence (`lookup.selectFirst`) is translated in all ten packs, but
 * its `{{fields}}` interpolation came straight off `dependsOn`, which holds
 * API names. So the rendered hint was localized around a raw identifier in
 * every locale, English included:
 *
 *     en    Select crm_account first
 *     zh-CN 请先选择crm_account
 *
 * The `en` row is why this is not merely an i18n bug: an English user was shown
 * an internal identifier. The form renderer knows the label (it already
 * resolves the same map for the fixed-option widgets' `emptyHint`) and now
 * hands it over as `dependsOnLabels`.
 *
 * All three gated surfaces are asserted — the trigger's visible text, the
 * trigger's `title`, and the "browse all" button's `title` — because they were
 * three independent copies of the same expression and a fix applied to one of
 * them looks identical from the outside.
