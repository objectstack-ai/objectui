/**
 * `ObjectGridSchema.operators` is a retirement tombstone that names the
 * upstream spelling (objectui#9739, maintainer ruling 2026-09-18, letter C).
 *
 * ## What was ruled, and which half of it each test below holds
 *
 * Letter C, verbatim: "`operators` is removed from the published mirror and a
 * tombstone is left in its place: the key is refused by name and the refusal
 * names the correct spelling the upstream protocol declares; it is not declared
 * on the TypeScript twin". Three claims, and each one fails independently here:
 * the refusal (a parse that must go red), its BY-NAME-ness (a lit control that
 * must stay green on the same schema), the remedy it names (asserted against
 * the installed upstream package rather than against this file's own prose),
 * and the twin's silence (the absence of a `@ts-expect-error`, which is an
 * assertion in this package — see the last section).
 *
 * ## Why the remedy is re-derived here instead of pinned as a string
 *
 * A tombstone whose message names the wrong key is worse than no tombstone: it
 * spends the author's trust to send them somewhere else wrong. So the spelling
 * is NOT asserted as a literal this file chose. The upstream section below
 * parses the same two documents through `@objectstack/spec`'s own
 * `ObjectGridPropsSchema` at the version this package pins, and the assertion
 * is that the key our message names is the one upstream ACCEPTS while the key
 * our message refuses is the one upstream REFUSES. If the protocol renames it
 * again, this file reddens rather than keeping a stale instruction alive.
 *
 * ## Every zero carries a lit control on the same instrument
 *
 * `ObjectGridSchema` reaches `BaseSchema`, which is `.passthrough()` — unknown
 * keys are KEPT unexamined, not refused. So a red parse proves nothing about
 * BY-NAME refusal on its own; what proves it is an unrecognised key parsed
 * through the same schema, on the same document, staying green. Upstream is the
 * mirror image: `ObjectGridPropsSchema` is a `strictObject`, so EVERY unknown
 * key is refused there and a bare refusal would be uninformative — the control
 * there is that the refusal message singles `operators` out with a rename
 * prescription an arbitrary unknown key does not get.

/**
 * ⛔ `operators` is NOT declared on `ObjectGridSchema` — letter C says so in as
 * many words, and letter A (declaring it) was the option refused.
 *
 * The absence of a `@ts-expect-error` on the literal below is the measurement,
 * not an omission: `ObjectGridSchema` extends `BaseSchema`, whose index
 * signature absorbs the key as `any`, so the compiler stays silent. Adding a
 * directive here would redden this package's `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` leg as
 * unused — which is exactly how this claim fails if anyone ever declares the
 * key on the twin, or if the twin loses that index signature.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is the asymmetry the tombstone deliberately creates and does not
 * hide: the VALIDATOR now refuses the document the COMPILER still absorbs. The
 * ruling accepted it — narrowing the mirror is the protocol-aligned direction,
 * and widening the interface to match would have written the misspelling into
 * the published TypeScript face.
