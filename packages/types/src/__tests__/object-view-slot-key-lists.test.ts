/**
 * `ObjectViewSchema`'s `table` and `form` slots SHIP the members they promise,
 * and their key lists cannot drift from the source schemas (objectui#6269).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The two slots were declared by deriving from the schema they document:
 *
 *   table?: Partial<Omit<ObjectGridSchema, 'type' | 'objectName'>>;
 *   form?:  Partial<Omit<ObjectFormSchema, 'type' | 'objectName' | 'mode'>>;
 *
 * Both derived types declared ZERO properties. `Omit<T, K>` is
 * `Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, K>>`, and `keyof T` on a type carrying a string
 * index signature is `string | number` — the literal member names are ABSORBED.
 * `ObjectGridSchema` and `ObjectFormSchema` both inherited `BaseSchema`'s
 * `[key: string]: any` (objectui#5155) until objectui#8347, so each `Pick` rebuilt a type holding
 * the index signature and none of the named members. Measured through the
 * checker before the fix:
 *
 *   ObjectGridSchema                                              -> 61 members
 *   Omit<ObjectGridSchema, 'type' | 'objectName'>                 ->  0 members
 *   ObjectFormSchema                                              -> 67 members
 *   Omit<ObjectFormSchema, 'type' | 'objectName' | 'mode'>        ->  0 members
 *
 * ⚠️ Those two member counts are the HISTORICAL reading that produced this
 * pin, kept verbatim because the `-> 0` half is only legible beside them. The
 * LIVE counts are 63 and 69: objectui#6357 declared `bind` on `BaseSchema`,
 * both schemas inherit it, and this guard turned red naming them — which is
 * precisely the drift it exists to catch. The key was added to both slot
 * unions in the same change, so the slots still ship the full configuration.
 * objectui#11070 then declared `dataSource` (the spec's per-element binding)
 * on both source schemas and the guard named it again: the `form` slot carries
 * it, and the `table` slot withholds it as a record source the view owns.
 * objectui#10872 batch 9 declared `responsiveStyles` on `ObjectGridSchema`, and
 * the `table` slot withholds it as a node-level key. Section 1 pins the counts
 * as they stand; the "63 and 69" above are the reading of their day.
 *
 * Nothing errored — the index signature answered every key as `any` — so the
 * symptoms were in the tools that READ the declaration: `table: { colunms: 3 }`
 * type-checked, `table: { pageSize: 'ten' }` type-checked, and editor completion
 * inside `table: { … }` offered nothing at all for a slot documented as
 * "inherits from ObjectGridSchema".
 *
 * This is objectui#6151's collapse in PROPERTY position. #6151's guard
 * (`stack-schema-emitted-members.test.ts`) walks the `LayoutSchema` UNION; these
 * two are properties on `ObjectViewSchema`, not union members, so that walker
 * cannot see them. Hence a second pin rather than an extension of the first.
 *
 * ## The repair, and the hazard it introduces
 *
 * Each `Omit` became a `Partial<Pick<…, ExplicitKeyUnion>>`. `Pick` with
 * LITERAL keys never computes `keyof T`, so it cannot collapse. The cost is a
 * hand-written key list that silently drifts the moment a member is added to
 * the source schema — a member that exists on `ObjectGridSchema` but is missing
 * from `ObjectGridSlotKey` is simply not configurable through the slot, and
 * nothing says so.
 *
 * ⭐ Neutralising that drift is what this file is for. It recomputes each source
 * schema's declared members THROUGH THE CHECKER — the same instrument that
 * produced the 61 -> 0 measurement — and requires the slot's member set to
 * equal exactly "source members minus the identity keys the view fixes" and,
 * for `table`, minus the withheld set below. A member added to
 * `ObjectGridSchema` and placed in neither list turns this red.
 *
 * ## The `table` slot withholds what the view's grid does not honour (objectui#10976)
 *
 * The repair above made the slot declare EVERY `ObjectGridSchema` member, and
 * `ObjectView` hands its grid only some of them: it reads a fixed set off
 * `table` by name and relays `OBJECT_VIEW_TABLE_RELAY_KEYS` verbatim
 * (`@object-ui/plugin-view`). Every other member type-checked on the slot and
 * reached nothing — `table: { editable: true }` was one of them until it was
 * relayed. `TABLE_WITHHELD_KEYS` below is the set the slot no longer declares,
 * each with the reason it has no meaning on the view's grid, and section 4
 * holds the zod twin to the same set: it must refuse each one BY NAME, so the
 * two faces refuse the same keys. Which keys `ObjectView` hands its grid is
 * pinned from the side that can read the renderer,
 * `plugin-view/src/__tests__/ObjectView.tableSlotRelay-10976.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## Why it emits its own declarations instead of reading `dist/`
 *
 * This repo's per-PR `test` job runs `pnpm test` with NO build ahead of it
 * (turbo's `test` task only `dependsOn: ["^build"]` — the DEPENDENCY closure,
 * never the package's own build), and `packages/types` has no workspace
 * dependencies, so nothing builds it. A guard reading `dist/objectql.d.ts`
 * would be absent-or-stale on a cold CI cache — vacuous exactly where it is
 * needed. So this file runs the package's OWN tsconfig through the compiler API
 * and measures the emitted declaration: the artifact a consumer resolves,
 * derived deterministically and with no dependence on CI job ordering. Same
 * reasoning as `stack-schema-emitted-members.test.ts` and
 * `package-exports-manifest.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## 🗑️ Removal condition (recorded at triage's request)
 *
 * These `Pick` lists exist because `BaseSchema` carried a root string index
 * signature. objectui#8347 removed it (the objectui#5155 phase this condition
 * waited for), so `keyof ObjectGridSchema` is the literal member union again
 * and `Omit` no longer collapses.
 * `ObjectFormSlotKey` and the `form` half of this file then become removable in
 * favour of the original `Omit` form. The `table` half does NOT: since
 * objectui#10976 its list is a deliberate subset, so an `Omit` would have to
 * name the withheld set, and what this file guards for `table` — that every
 * grid member is either handed to the grid or withheld, and that both faces
 * withhold the same keys — stays true work. `declaresStringIndex` below is the
 * tripwire that noticed the index signature going: it reports `false` for the
 * source schemas since objectui#8347, so the collapse half of this file is gone
 * and the `form` half may move back to `Omit` (not done here: the removal PR
 * flipped the tripwires and left the lists, which still hold).
