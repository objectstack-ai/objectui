/**
 * THE discriminator for the three registry keys this ONE widget serves —
 * `markdown`, `html` and `richtext` (objectui#5498).
 *
 * It is `field.type`, and establishing that was the load-bearing half of the
 * card, because the obvious candidate is wrong in a way that fails silently:
 *
 *  - `field.format` is NOT a discriminator. It is declared on `date`,
 *    `datetime`, `time`, `phone` and `auto_number` and on no rich-content
 *    type, so `richField?.format` read `undefined` for every real field and
 *    the old `|| 'markdown'` tail answered `markdown` for all three. Branching
 *    on it would have routed `html` and `richtext` — whose values are entirely
 *    HTML — through the markdown pipeline, which drops raw HTML and renders a
 *    populated value as NOTHING (the objectui#5452 failure, reintroduced on the
 *    form). The editor header showing "Format: markdown" for an `html` field is
 *    the same phantom read, visible; it is derived from the type now.
 *  - the RESOLVED WIDGET KEY (`widget || field.widget || type`, the form
 *    renderer's `resolveWidgetType`) is not visible from inside a widget, and
 *    keying off it would be wrong anyway: every other read surface dispatches
 *    `getCellRenderer` on the field TYPE, so `type` is what keeps this form
 *    branch agreeing with the grid, the detail page and the rest.
 *
 * The `field:` prefix is stripped for the same reason the form renderer's own
 * `normalizeFieldType` strips it: the object-schema path emits the prefixed id
 * and hand-written form schemas the bare one, and they name the same kind.
 *
 * A type with no entry in {@link richTextCellRenderer} — a foreign type
 * force-routed here by a `widget:` override, or a host that passed no metadata
 * at all — is answered by the caller as PLAIN TEXT, which is what
 * `getCellRenderer` answers for it too. Not by a guessed rich-content default.

/**
 * Rich text field with markdown/HTML support
 * For now, this is a simple textarea. A full implementation would use
 * a rich text editor like TipTap, Lexical, or Slate.
 *
 * Reached by forms as `field:markdown` and `field:html`; both resolve here.
 *
 * ## Fullscreen editing (objectui#3301)
 *
 * `ObjectForm` stamps `mobile_fullscreen` onto the metadata of every long-text
 * field — textarea AND rich-text — when `ObjectFormSchema.mobile
 * .fullscreenLongText` is set, and `ObjectFormSchema.mobile`'s own JSDoc has
 * always promised "textarea/rich-text get an expand button". This widget never
 * read the flag, so for `field:markdown` / `field:html` that promise did
 * nothing at all: the producer stamped, and no consumer existed.
 *
 * The flag is read off `field` and nowhere else — the single metadata carrier
 * since objectui#3233 — matching `TextAreaField` read for read, so a
 * misspelled flag stays inert in both widgets rather than being caught by a
 * tolerant fallback in one of them. The affordance and dialog themselves come
 * from the shared `FullscreenFieldEditor`, so one form-level setting keeps
 * producing one behaviour across both widgets.
 *
 * ## Readonly display (objectui#5498)
 *
 * The readonly early return used to render `{value}` as a React TEXT CHILD,
 * so a readonly field of any of the three types showed the user the markup
 * SOURCE of their own content — a `markdown` field's asterisks and hashes, a
 * `richtext` field's tags. The `prose` classes on that wrapper were the tell:
 * they exist to style RENDERED rich content and there was none to style. Every
 * other read surface — grid, kanban card, gallery, related list, dashboard
 * record panel, record detail read mode — dispatches through `getCellRenderer`
 * and renders the same stored bytes FORMATTED, so one field disagreed with
 * itself depending on which surface it was read on, and this branch was the
 * one disagreeing with the platform.
 *
 * It now renders through {@link richTextCellRenderer} — literally the same
 * components `getCellRenderer` resolves, one table shared by both (see
 * `./richTextDisplay.tsx`), so the html/richtext path carries that renderer's
 * `sanitizeHtml` trust boundary rather than a second hand-rolled escape, and a
 * future change to either pipeline moves both surfaces at once.
 *
 * ## Host plumbing (objectui#4810)
 *
 * The editable branch had no `toDomProps` at all, so everything
 * `<FormControl>`'s Radix `Slot` hands down — the field's `id`, the
 * `aria-describedby` naming its `<FormDescription>` and `<FormMessage>` —
 * arrived as props and landed on no element. Measured on a real form: the
 * visible label's `for` pointed at an id nothing carried (`for=DANGLING`) and
 * the rendered description had zero consumers, for all three registry keys
 * (`markdown` / `html` / `richtext`) since they are this one widget.
 *
 * The fix is objectui#3318's standing recipe — `toDomProps(props)` spread onto
 * the REAL focusable control, which here is the `<Textarea>` inside
 * `RichTextEditorSurface`, never the wrapper `<div>`s (a non-focusable wrapper
 * carrying the id would satisfy `document.getElementById` and still leave the
 * label inert). Only the inline surface receives it; see `domProps` there for
 * why the dialog's copy must not.

   *
   *  - `ObjectForm` sets `formField.maxLength` for a hand-written list of
   *    types. For an object-schema-derived field that assignment lands on the
   *    FORM FIELD, while the metadata carrier registered widgets read is
   *    `formField.field` — a different object — so no registered widget has
   *    ever seen it. Ablating the assignment entirely changes no rendered
   *    attribute on either the registered or the builtin path.
   *  - `EmbeddableForm`'s `DEFAULT_MAX_LENGTH` caps `markdown` and `html` at
   *    5000. There the form field IS the carrier, so the value did arrive —
   *    and then died here, unread.
   *
   * ⇒ The cap was invisible for ALL THREE registry keys, not just `richtext`:
   * no native stop, no counter, and nothing named in `aria-describedby`, while
   * `buildValidationRules` (which has no field-type gate) rejected the same
   * text at SUBMIT. That is the worst ordering of the three possible ones —
   * the person is told after writing — and it is what this read ends.
   *
   * The camelCase half stays a narrow structural read for the same reason it
   * does in `TextAreaField`: the objectui metadata types deliberately do not
   * declare the spec spelling.
