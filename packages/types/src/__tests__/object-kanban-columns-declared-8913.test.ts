 * objectui#8913 — `ObjectKanbanSchema.columns` is DECLARED on both faces, and
 * the element is the PROTOCOL's union rather than this repository's runtime
 * lane type.
 *
 * ## What was measurably wrong
 *
 * Retiring the bare `kanban` node type key (objectui#8802) removed the only
 * face that judged a lane. `object-kanban` never declared `columns`, so the key
 * rode `BaseSchema`'s `.passthrough()` on the surviving face: the renderer read
 * it at three sites while neither published face named it, and
 * `columns: "todo"`, `columns: [42]`, a lane with no `title` and — the one
 * objectui#6939 was filed for — a lane card with no `title` all parsed GREEN.
 *
 * Declaring on a face that already carries `[key: string]: any` /
 * `.passthrough()` can only NARROW. That direction check is the first `it`
 * below, and it is asserted rather than asserted-in-prose.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Why the element is NOT `KanbanColumn`
 *
 * The card that dispatched this work proposed `columns: KanbanColumn[]`. That
 * is a PROPOSAL, and it is falsified by measurement on three independent axes.
 * `KanbanColumn` requires `cards`; it is the RUNTIME lane —
 * `bucketCardsIntoColumns` fills `cards` before `KanbanImpl` / `KanbanEnhanced`
 * ever see a lane — and as the AUTHORING element it would refuse:
 *
 *   1. **the protocol's own gate-validated example.**
 *      `@objectstack/spec` declares this key as
 *      `columns: z.array(z.unknown()).optional()` with its element shape stated
 *      in `describe` prose — "Swimlane definitions ({ id, title } per `groupBy`
 *      value, or bare value strings) — NOT a field projection" — and the
 *      protocol's own docs author three lanes as `{ id, title }` with no
 *      `cards`, inside an `os:check-yaml PageComponentSchema` fence;
 *   2. **the renderer.** `bucketCardsIntoColumns` reads `col.cards || []` on
 *      both of its legs, and the lanes `ObjectKanban` materializes from a
 *      picklist or from the data carry no `cards` at all;
 *   3. **this repository's own typed corpus.** Several `plugin-kanban` board
 *      fixtures author `columns: [{ id, title }]` under
 *      `satisfies ObjectKanbanSchema`.
 *
 * Refusing the bare-string arm would fail the same way, one arm over. The
 * maintainer principle in force decides both (2026-09-09, recorded verbatim and
 * NOT translated):
 *
 *   > 我们的项目以 objectstack 协议为准，文档应该以实际实现为准。协议不正确的应该先修改协议。
 *
 * ⇒ `cards` is OPTIONAL and both arms are admitted. Narrowing further is an
 * `@objectstack/spec` card, not a local edit.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ And the two shapes the first cut got WRONG in the other direction
 *
 * Contract review caught this file pinning two shapes as ACCEPTED that the
 * renderer mishandles — freezing a defect as correct, which is worse than not
 * pinning at all. Both are measured at the real `bucketCardsIntoColumns`, each
 * against a control leg, and both now sit in `REFUSED`:
 *
 *   - **a NUMERIC lane id.** The first cut admitted one, justified by "the
 *     renderer coerces with `String(col.id)`". That is true at the i18n lookup
 *     in `localizeColumn` and FALSE where lane membership is decided: the
 *     bucketer built `knownIds` from the RAW `col.id` and compared it with
 *     `Object.keys(groups)`, which are strings. Lanes `{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }`
 *     with records `status: 1` / `status: '2'` came back
 *     `1:r1, 2:r2, __uncolumned__:r1+r2` — every card rendered TWICE — against
 *     a clean `one:r1` string control. objectui#8993 repaired that sweep; the
 *     refusal stays because one declared lane-id type beats two, not because
 *     the renderer is still broken. `KanbanColumn.id` and its mirror are `string`, and the
 *     protocol names no type, so refusing it here is not a narrowing below the
 *     protocol.
 *   - **a MIXED array.** `columns` is a UNION OF TWO ARRAYS, not an array of a
 *     union. `effectiveColumns` dispatches on `columns[0]` ALONE, so an
 *     object-first mix sends every string element down the object branch and a
 *     string-first mix is ignored whole. Measured with
 *     `[{ id: 'done', title: 'Done' }, 'todo']`:
 *     `done:r2, undefined:, __uncolumned__:r1` — a blank lane whose own keys
 *     are `["0","1","2","3","cards"]` and the `todo` record in
 *     "Uncategorized". The protocol's "or" names two array shapes and no mixed
 *     example; if a later ruling reads it as a per-element union, that is an
 *     `@objectstack/spec` card.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The bare-string arm is admitted for PARITY and is INERT on this face
 *
 * The renderer honours a bare-string lane list only when no `groupBy` is
 * authored (`ObjectKanban.tsx`, the `effectiveColumns` memo: the string branch
 * returns only under `if (!schema.groupBy)`), and `groupBy` is REQUIRED on this
 * face. So no document that passes this schema can reach it. It is admitted
 * because refusing an arm the protocol names would be a second narrowing, not
 * because it does anything; the requiredness is objectui#8990, and ⛔ this card
 * does not wait on it.
 *
 * ⚠️ "Accepted and dropped" (the strip row below) is the TOLERANT face's
 * posture. The strict authoring twin refuses the same undeclared lane key by
 * name.
 *
 * ## The firing control, and why it is this one
 *
 * Every refusal below is paired with the SAME lane bag written under an
 * UNDECLARED key. That document is ACCEPTED, because `BaseSchema` is
 * `.passthrough()` — which is exactly the state `columns` was in before this
 * card. So the control is not a re-implementation of the old face; it IS the
 * old face's mechanism, reached through a key nothing declares. Delete the
 * `columns` declaration and every refusal here goes green while the control
 * stays green: the instrument reports its own removal.
