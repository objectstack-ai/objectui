/**
 * Retirement pin — the six `ChatbotSchema` members no `plugin-chatbot`
 * registration reads are REFUSED, not silently ignored (objectui#7703,
 * ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove, one decision per key).
 *
 * ## The failure this pin exists to prevent
 *
 * `loading`, `showAvatars`, `userAvatar`, `assistantAvatar`, `markdown` and
 * `height` were declared on `ChatbotSchema`, mirrored on its Zod twin, and read
 * by NOTHING — two of them (`showAvatars`, `markdown`) advertising a
 * `@default true` for a switch that did not exist. An author, or an AI author
 * reading the `.d.ts`, wrote `showAvatars: true` or `height: 400` on a
 * `chatbot` node, got no error on either published face, and saw no change.
 *
 * The instrument, re-measured on this branch's base (`21d7989fb`, i.e. AFTER
 * objectui#7708's fence landed as PR #8077): one `schema.KEY` count per
 * `ComponentRegistry.register(...)` body of
 * `packages/plugin-chatbot/src/renderer.tsx`, the file split at the three
 * register calls. All six read 0 / 0 / 0 across
 * `chatbot` / `chatbot-enhanced` / `chatbot-floating`. Lit controls on the same
 * instrument in the same pass — `placeholder` 1 / 1 / 1, `messages` 1 / 1 / 1,
 * `userAvatarUrl` 1 / 1 / 1, `maxHeight` 1 / 1 / 0, `floatingConfig` 0 / 0 / 1,
 * `processVisibility` 0 / 1 / 0 — so the zeros are readings, not a blind grep.
 *
 * ⭐ `showAvatars` is the one key whose provenance differs, and the difference
 * is recorded rather than smoothed over: `<ChatbotEnhanced>` HAS a
 * `showAvatars` prop, and until objectui#7708 the `chatbot-floating`
 * registration's raw trailing `{...props}` spread delivered an authored value
 * to it unfiltered. That card was ruled FENCE and landed as PR #8077 — the
 * spread is filtered through `toDomProps` at the head of the element now — so
 * `showAvatars` is a key the FENCE turned dark, not a key nothing ever read.
 * The other five were live on no channel at any time: they are not
 * `ChatbotEnhancedProps` members either (`markdown` exists there only as
 * `enableMarkdown`), so the spread had nothing to land them on.
 *
 * ⛔ `processVisibility` is NOT part of this retirement — `chatbot-enhanced`
 * reads it (0 / 1 / 0). It is pinned live below as a control, so the boundary
 * cannot rot into prose.
 *
 * ## Why tombstones and not deletions
 *
 * All six HAVE a Zod arm, which is what decides the route here: `BaseSchema` is
 * `.passthrough()` on the Zod side and carries a `[key: string]: any` index
 * signature on the TS side, so an UNDECLARED key is not refused, it is KEPT.
 * Deleting the members would hand the authored spelling exactly the silent
 * no-op this card exists to close. `?: never` + `retirementTombstone()` is this
 * package's convention — `MarkdownSchema.sanitize` / `.components`
 * (objectui#6972), `TimelineSchema.timeScale` (objectui#6355),
 * `ObjectKanbanSchema` item ① (objectui#7322), `ObjectViewSchema.viewTabBar`
 * (objectui#7779) — and it is lockstep: both halves or neither. The "deleted"
 * row is pinned live below as a control.
 *
 * ## Why not ENFORCE, per key — the other arm, refused six times
 *
 * `<Chatbot>` (`plugin-chatbot/src/index.tsx`), the component THIS
 * registration renders, declares `messages`, `placeholder`, `onSendMessage`,
 * `disabled`, `showTimestamp`, `userAvatarUrl`, `userAvatarFallback`,
 * `assistantAvatarUrl`, `assistantAvatarFallback` and `maxHeight` — not one of
 * the six. Enforcing any of them means growing a component prop (a feature) or
 * publishing a SECOND spelling of a key that already works (AGENTS.md #0.1).
 * Per key: `loading` is runtime state the chat runtime owns; `showAvatars` has
 * no target on `<Chatbot>` and re-declaring it on the faces that DO reach
 * `<ChatbotEnhanced>` would re-open by declaration the channel objectui#7708
 * closed by fence; `userAvatar` / `assistantAvatar` / `height` / `markdown`
 * each have a live sibling (`userAvatarUrl`, `assistantAvatarUrl`, `maxHeight`,
 * `enableMarkdown`) that the registrations already read.
 *
 * The `@ts-expect-error` directives are REAL enforcement: this package
 * type-checks its tests through `tsconfig.test.json`, so re-widening a
 * declaration fails the build on the unused directive (TS2578). A green
 * `vitest` run is NOT evidence about them — type assertions are erased before
 * it runs.
