## Quick Example

```json
{
  "type": "form",
  "title": "Contact Us",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "input",
      "name": "email",
      "label": "Your Email",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "type": "textarea",
      "name": "message",
      "label": "Message"
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "submit",
      "label": "Send Message",
