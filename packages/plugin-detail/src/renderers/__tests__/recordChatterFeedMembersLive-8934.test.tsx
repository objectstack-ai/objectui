 * `record:chatter.feed` / `record:discussion.feed` — the FILTER members are
 * live on this path, and the AFFORDANCE members still are (objectui#8934)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` declares `RecordChatterProps.feed:
 * RecordActivityProps.optional()` (`component.zod.ts:1366`), bound to both
 * `record:chatter` (`:2948`) and `record:discussion` (`:2962`). So `feed` IS
 * the `record:activity` shape, filter members included, and a renderer that
 * dropped them had an IMPLEMENTATION GAP rather than a narrower contract.
 * `renderers/record-chatter.tsx` now runs `applyFeedConfig` with the same call
 * shape `record-activity.tsx:219` uses, and this file pins that.
 *
 * ⚠️ AN EARLIER SHAPE OF THIS FILE PINNED THE OPPOSITE, and that is the reason
 * it is worth stating here rather than in a card. It asserted that a filter
 * member authored inside `feed` changed nothing — true of the implementation at
 * the time, and therefore a LOCK on ever closing the gap: wiring the pipeline in
 * turned exactly those cases red. A pin whose subject is "the implementation
 * disagrees with the protocol" freezes the disagreement. The direction the
 * maintainer ruled is the opposite one: the protocol is the contract, docs
 * follow the implementation, and a protocol that is wrong is changed in
 * `@objectstack/spec` first.
 *
 * ## What a control has to do here, now that `applyFeedConfig` is the SUBJECT
 *
 * In the earlier shape `applyFeedConfig` was the firing control: running the
 * fixture through it proved the values were effective, so a zero on the panel
 * was a reading about the path. It cannot play that part any more — it is the
 * pipeline under test. Three controls replace it, and each answers a different
 * way this pin could be green over nothing:
 *
 *   AGREEMENT       the rows the panel renders are exactly the ids
 *                   `applyFeedConfig` returns for the same authored config, so
 *                   the pin says WHICH pipeline ran, not merely that something
 *                   moved.
 *   KEEP-LEG        every filter that removes a row is paired with a value of
 *                   the SAME member that keeps it, so "the row is gone" is
 *                   never satisfiable by a panel that renders nothing.
 *   UNDECLARED-KEY  a key the shape does not declare, authored in the same
 *                   position, moves nothing — so the panel is reacting to the
 *                   declared members and not to the mere presence of a `feed`.
 *
 * ## The five affordances are unchanged by the route, and still pinned
 *
 * `config.feed` still reaches `RecordActivityTimeline`, which reads the five
 * affordance members at `:213-217`. `showSubscriptionToggle` is pinned on that
 * component directly: it is read, but the bell is gated at `:326` behind
 * `showSubscription && subscription` and `RecordChatterRenderer` passes no
 * `subscription`, so the component is where its live subject is.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT covered here, and not claimed: `filterMode` and `enableMentions` are
 * also members of the declared shape and are still unread on this path
 * (`applyFeedConfig` covers the four filter members only). That gap is
 * objectui#8968, and pinning it either way is that card's business.
 *
 * ## Resolution
 *
 * Nothing resolves through any `dist/`: `../record-chatter`,
 * `../recordActivityFeed` and `../../RecordActivityTimeline` are this package's
 * own source, and `@object-ui/react` is mapped to its `src` by the root
 * `vitest.config.mts` alias table.
