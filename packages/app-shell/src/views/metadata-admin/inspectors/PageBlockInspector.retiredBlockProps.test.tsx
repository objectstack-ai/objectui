/**
 * objectui#7772 — the `object-kanban` panel on screen: the lane picker now
 * writes `groupBy`, `limit` is authorable, and a stored `groupField` is gone
 * from both the panel and the next save.
 *
 * The sibling `previews/__tests__/block-config.test.ts` pins the TABLE and the
 * strip function. That is a fact about data. This file pins the fact about the
 * screen, and they are different for the reason
 * `PageBlockInspector.sectionName.test.tsx` states: `BLOCK_CONFIG` is data, and
 * what an author gets is whatever `renderField` and the generic "Advanced"
 * section do with it. Two of the three facts below are only reachable here:
 *
 *   - a retired key that is no longer a curated field falls into ADVANCED,
 *     whose editor can set a value but has no delete — so "not offered as a
 *     curated control" and "not on screen at all" are different claims, and
 *     only the second one is the fix;
 *   - `blockProps` is the single value every property write spreads from, so
 *     whether the retired key rides back out is decided by a real commit, not
 *     by reading the strip in isolation.
 *
 * ## NOT pinned here, deliberately: page-schema rejection
 *
 * Measured against the pinned `@objectstack/spec`: `PageSchema.safeParse` does
 * not look inside a block's `properties` at all — a page carrying
 * `properties: { zzzTotallyBogusKey: 1 }` parses green, so a poisoned kanban
 * block was never blocked at the designer's save gate. The refusal is on the
 * NODE face (`ObjectKanbanSchema`, `@object-ui/types/zod`), which is where the
 * sibling suite asserts it. Pinning "the committed draft parses" here would be
 * a green light that means nothing.
 *
 * FIXTURE DISCIPLINE (#3216's method, as in the sibling suites): the page is
 * authored the way a user does and fed through `PageSchema.parse`, so the
 * fixture cannot drift from the spec.
