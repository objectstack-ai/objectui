 * objectui#6459 — the data-table SCHEMA SLOT ObjectGrid fills (the receiver
 * half of the seam whose producer half #6004 typed).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DEFECT IS TYPE-LEVEL, SO A RENDERING TEST IS BLIND TO IT — same as
 * `columnEmitBoundary-6004.test.ts` next door, and for the same reason: a grid
 * renders identically with `const dataTableSchema: any`. What can fail is a
 * COMPILE, so these pins are compile-time and this file's value is that
 * `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` reads it (verified with `--listFiles`, not
 * assumed — the package build's program excludes `__tests__`).
 *
 * The mechanism pinned here is DIFFERENT from #6004's. There, `.map()`
 * laundered freshness away and only `?: never` tombstones could refuse; here
 * both writers are literals sitting DIRECTLY in annotated positions, so
 * excess-property checking is the live instrument — PROVIDED the type has no
 * index signature. `BaseSchema`'s `[key: string]: any` (which `DataTableSchema`
 * inherited until objectui#8347) made every key a member, and a check that
 * refuses non-members has nothing to refuse when non-membership cannot exist.
 * `RemoveIndexSignature` in `ObjectGrid.tsx` is what turned the annotation from
 * inert to able-to-fail (it strips nothing since objectui#8347), and the pins
 * below hold each half of that claim separately.

   *
   * ## Why it records a VERDICT rather than a bare "is not declared"
   *
   * The column-level twin carries BOTH polarities, because its keys are in
   * different states: `headerIcon` is pinned as DECLARED by `TableColumn` (the
   * post-expiry state, `:64` there) and `pinned` as NOT declared (still held,
   * `:138`). Both schema-level holds are in the FIRST state — objectui#6882
   * declared them on 2026-08-30 and objectui#7196 re-derived the prose — so a
   * bare "is NOT declared" would be FALSE here for both keys: a permanently red
   * suite, which is not a gate. What this file can honestly pin is each hold's
   * MEASURED verdict, in a shape that reddens when it flips EITHER way:
   *
   *   - HELD to DECLARED is the event the census was blind to (objectui#7201);
   *   - DECLARED to HELD is the event that would silently invalidate the
   *     "removing these members is inert" measurement objectui#6919 waits on —
   *     the hold would become load-bearing again with nothing going red.
   *
   * The "is NOT declared" shape the card names is present and live in this
   * suite: it is the `HeldLocally` half, exercised on control keys in the next
   * test, because there is no hold left to exercise it on.
   *
   * ⚠️ FOR objectui#6919, WHICH REMOVES THESE MEMBERS: this test is where the
   * removal reports. Deleting both members makes the pins below fail their `K`
   * constraint and takes `keyof ObjectGridDataTableSchemaHolds` to `never`; the
   * body is then replaced by a single
   * `Expect<Equal<keyof ObjectGridDataTableSchemaHolds, never>>`. That red is
