 * objectui#9806 (ruling B) — a Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click on an `ObjectView` row
 * opens the record as a full page in a new browser tab, re-derived rather than
 * described.
 *
 * ## How this file got here
 *
 * It began as the pin for a SENTENCE: PR objectui#9797 wrote a comment on
 * `ObjectView`'s `handleRowClick` saying the hook decides modifier clicks when
 * no host handler is present, and the hook never gets to — its `handleClick`
 * returns EARLY on the `onRowClick` it is handed, ahead of its own modifier
 * branch, and `ObjectView` hands `handleRowClick` down UNCONDITIONALLY. The
 * first version of this file pinned the resulting behaviour (a modifier click
 * indistinguishable from a plain one). The ruling on objectui#9806 then chose
 * B: `ObjectView` implements the browser convention itself, inside
 * `handleRowClick`, and the hook's early return STAYS — it is what lets a host
 * handler decide for itself. The subject cases below are the inversion; the
 * two controls are the original ones, kept.
 *
 * ## What is pinned, and why every case fires a PAIR of clicks
 *
 * "A modifier click opens a tab" is not on its own a reading about modifiers:
 * a subject that opened a tab on EVERY click would pass it. So each subject
 * case is read against the plain click on the same harness:
 *
 *  - SUBJECT (`ObjectView`, no host `onRowClick`): a plain click navigates in
 *    place (`onNavigate(id, 'view')`, no tab); a ⌘ / Ctrl / middle click opens
 *    `window.open(URL, '_blank')` and does NOT navigate in place. The URL is the
 *    one `navigation.mode: 'new_window'` already opens — asserted equal to it
 *    in the same run, so the modifier branch cannot grow a second URL shape.
 *    ⛔ `onNavigate` is never called with `'new_window'`: `ObjectViewSchema`
 *    declares that callback's second parameter as `'view' | 'edit'`.
 *  - INERT ROWS stay inert: `navigation.mode: 'none'` ignores a ⌘-click as it
 *    ignores a plain one. A modifier changes WHERE a record opens, never
 *    WHETHER it opens.
 *  - HOST HANDLER: a host `onRowClick` receives the ⌘-click, payload intact,
 *    and no tab opens — the host keeps the whole decision (ruling: option C,
 *    inverting the hook, refused for exactly this reason).
 *  - LIVENESS CONTROL (`ObjectGrid`, no `onRowClick` at all): the same harness
 *    reaches the HOOK's modifier branch — `'view'` and `'new_window'` diverge —
 *    so `metaKey` really is delivered by these clicks.
 *  - ISOLATION CONTROL: the SAME `ObjectGrid` call plus one prop — an
 *    unconditional `onRowClick` — and the hook's modifier branch goes quiet.
 *    That is the reason `ObjectView` has to answer the click itself.
 *
 * ⚠️ The liveness control does NOT vary one thing against the subject: it is a
 * different composition and carries `onNavigate` on the grid node, which
 * `ObjectView` does not relay into the grid schema it builds. It answers "is
 * the probe alive", nothing more. The ISOLATION control is the one-variable
 * pair.
 *
 * ## The source-text cases
 *
 * `ObjectView.tsx` DOCUMENTS the constructs asserted on, so its comments are
 * stripped before any code claim is read, and the stripper is controlled in
 * both directions in the same run (a token present raw, absent stripped). A
 * member DECLARATION survives the strip, so the hook's presence leg is keyed on
 * the READ spelling `event.metaKey`, with the declaration's weaker answer
 * pinned beside it.
