/**
 * `app-shell` is NOT a component key (objectui#4841, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove,
 * remove side, maintainer ruling 2026-08-16).
 *
 * ## What was removed and why
 *
 * `registerLayout()` used to register `AppShell` under `app-shell`, with no
 * `inputs`. The key resolved, so `{ "type": "app-shell" }` parsed and built a
 * component — and that component could never be an app shell. Four of
 * `AppShellProps`' seven keys are `React.ReactNode` slots (`sidebar`, `navbar`,
 * `children`, `rightRail`) and a JSON document can fill none of them, which left
 * a node exactly two outcomes:
 *
 *   - `children` was dropped in SILENCE — `SchemaRenderer` strips `children`
 *     (and `body`) before spreading a node's keys as props, and `AppShell` reads
 *     its `children` PROP, never `schema.children`. The `<main>` element
 *     rendered empty, console.error count 0.
 *   - a schema in `sidebar` / `navbar` / `rightRail` reached the component as a
 *     plain object, which React refuses to render, so the node became the
 *     renderer's error box.
 *
 * Only `className` / `defaultOpen` / `branding` survived the JSON path, i.e. the
 * best result JSON could reach was a shell with no navigation, no top bar and an
 * empty content area — and with no `inputs` declared, `sdui-parser` had no
 * declaration face to compare a node against, so neither outcome was diagnosed
 * (objectui#3972's family).
 *
 * ## What this file pins
 *
 * Removing a registration is trivially reversible and reads like a cleanup, so
 * the state is pinned on the two faces that can disagree — the SOURCE (no
 * register call) and the LIVE registry (nothing else claims the key either,
 * bare or namespaced) — plus the fact the removal exists to produce: the node is
 * refused BY NAME.
 *
 * The refusal is measured, not asserted from the error-code table: the test
 * renders the node and reads the panel. `layout:page:card` is rendered the same
 * way as the control (it was `responsive-grid` until objectui#11441 retired that
 * key), because "no unknown-component panel appeared" is exactly
 * the shape that passes for an empty reason — a probe that cannot tell a
 * registered key from an unregistered one would be green on both.
 *
 * The other half of the ruling is pinned too: `AppShell` stays EXPORTED as a
 * React composition primitive, and `app-schema-renderer` stays registered WITH
 * `inputs` as the one JSON door to a metadata-driven shell. Deleting either is
 * a different decision from deregistering the key, and this file fails if one
 * is taken for the other.
 *
 * Not pinned here: `content/docs/guide/layout.md`'s prose, which belongs to
 * `guide-layout-app-shell-doc.test.ts` (objectui#4827) and — for the registered
 * key list the page publishes — `guide-layout-sidebar-nav-doc.test.ts`
 * (objectui#4840).
