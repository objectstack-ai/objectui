 * Exit: 0 = a reading was taken and every PINNED context is present
 *       2 = the reading COULD NOT BE TAKEN -- never a pass
 *       3 = BREACH: a pinned context, or the rule carrying it, is gone
 *
 * ## The gap (objectui#9422, out of the residual of objectui#3535)
 *
 * `main` sits behind an enforced merge queue whose required set currently holds
 * nine contexts. That set lives in GitHub ruleset 11776024 -- repository
 * SETTINGS. Removing a member from it reds no gate, fires no alarm, and leaves
 * no trace in a diff anybody reviews.
 *
 * What that costs is not hypothetical. On 2026-08-07, with the required set
 * effectively empty, three pull requests (#3503, #3510, #3516) merged with
 * `Type Check` at `conclusion=failure` onto a `main` that #3498 had left with a
 * type error; #3505 hot-fixed the result. objectui#3523 installed the set that
 * prevents a recurrence. This file watches that set, so losing it again is
 * something the repository can SAY, rather than something it discovers the next
 * time a type error rides the queue in.
 *
 * ## ⭐ The premise this file is built on, and how to re-take it
 *
 * The repository used to say, in more than one place, that this surface cannot
 * be read from here. Those sentences were TRUE when they were written:
 * objectui#4959 recorded a merge landing while all four `Test (shard N/4)` jobs
 * were `in_progress`, which is possible only if none of them was required. The
 * ruleset was edited afterwards (`updated_at` 2026-08-24) and the prose was
 * not. objectui#9502 repaired the carriers it could reach, in the direction
 * this file makes available -- each one now separates the read half from the
 * write half and POINTS here rather than answering for itself:
 *
 *   content/docs/guide/ci-cd-pipeline.md        "Merge Queue" step 3, and the
 *                                               Dependabot Auto-Merge section
 *   .github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml the header's "does NOT do" list
 *   scripts/dependabot-merge-gate.mjs           "declared = enforced"
 *
 * ⛔ One carrier is deliberately left standing, and it is not an oversight:
 *
 *   AGENTS.md                             "从仓内读不到"
 *
 * AGENTS.md is GOVERNED surface -- an agent drafts it, an authorised approver
 * lands it -- so objectui#9502 did not touch it. It may also be true on a leg
 * the repaired sentences never had: its parenthetical covers who may BYPASS the
 * ruleset as well as the required-context list, and bypass actors are not
 * carried by `GET /rules/branches/{branch}`, the endpoint this file reads.
 * ⛔ Ruling on it is a separate, governed decision and is not made here.
 *
 * The WRITE half of every one of them is still true and this file does not
 * touch it. ⛔ This script never writes: no enrolment, no removal, no ruleset
 * edit. It issues exactly one GET.
 *
 * The READ half is false for a job that has network, and that is the whole
 * reason this gate is cheap rather than impossible:
 *
 *   GET /repos/objectstack-ai/objectui/rules/branches/main   -> HTTP 200
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-14 on ruleset 11776024, which answered with all five rule
 * types (`deletion`, `merge_queue`, `non_fast_forward`, `pull_request`,
 * `required_status_checks`) and the nine contexts in `WATCHED_CONTEXTS` below.
 *
 * ⚠️ The reading above was taken through an agent egress proxy that injects
 * credentials, so it does NOT establish what scope the endpoint needs: the same
 * request made with a deliberately invalid bearer token, and with no
 * `Authorization` header at all, also answered 200 with the identical body, and
 * `/rate_limit` answered 15000/hour unauthenticated. That is a broken
 * instrument for the scope question and it is recorded as one. What IS
 * established is that the endpoint answers the shape this file parses. Whether
 * `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` under `permissions: contents: read` suffices is
 * settled by the first live run of `required-check-set-patrol.yml`, and the
 * failure direction is safe: no token, or too little scope, is exit 2 (CANNOT
 * READ), never exit 0.
 *
 * ## Two tiers, because a job rename must not manufacture a red
 *
 * `PINNED_CONTEXTS` is what this gate REFUSES over. `WATCHED_CONTEXTS` is the
 * rest of the live set, reported and never red.
 *
 * The split is objectui#9422's triage ruling, and the measurement behind it is
 * this: pinning a context by NAME makes a legitimate job rename red the gate,
 * and a check that goes red on healthy work is how a repository teaches itself
 * to ignore red (objectui#6596). Renames of these names are rare but NOT
 * hypothetical -- `git log -S` over `.github/workflows/` finds one
 * count-changing commit for each of `Type Check`, `Build & E2E`, `Build Docs`
 * and `Changeset Declaration`, two for `Lint` (`6bdb970a04`, 2026-02-18, moved
 * lint to `workflow_dispatch`), and the test-shard SHAPE has already changed
 * once: `71be244d52` (2026-07-17) introduced the 4-way matrix, and `9f7d786bdc`
 * later split the coverage lane into its own four shards. A pin on
 * `Test (shard 1/4)` is a pin on a matrix width that has moved before.
 *
 * `Type Check` is pinned because it is the leg the recorded incident actually
 * failed on. ⚠️ It is also the leg the merge queue has never been OBSERVED
 * rejecting on -- across the 94 merge-queue rejections measured on this
 * repository the failing job is always a Test shard. objectui#3535's dev
 * refused to infer from configuration that the leg would fire and that refusal
 * stands here: this file does not claim the leg is proven. It cuts one way
 * only, and it is an argument FOR watching: the `Type Check` leg is untested in
 * practice, so its silent removal is the removal least likely to be noticed.
 *
 * ⇒ the failure mode ACCEPTED by this split: a silent removal of any of the
 * eight watched contexts is REPORTED in the run summary and does not fail
 * anything. Eight ninths of the set is made observable, not enforced. Promoting
 * one is a one-line move from `WATCHED_CONTEXTS` to `PINNED_CONTEXTS` and a
 * maintainer's call, not a tidy-up.
 *
 * ## Why the rule types are pinned too, and why that is not a widening
 *
 * `Type Check` being a member of a `required_status_checks` rule means nothing
 * if the `merge_queue` rule is gone -- the contexts would then gate a pull
 * request and nothing would gate the queue, which is a different repository
 * from the one this gate believes it is watching. Both rule TYPES are therefore
 * required to be present. A rule type is not a job name: no rename can move it,
 * so this leg cannot manufacture the red the ruling was protecting against.
 *
 * ## An empty answer is a BREACH, not a clean read
 *
 * `GET /rules/branches/<branch>` answers `200 []` for a branch no ruleset
 * targets -- measured on this repository against `zzz-no-such-branch-9422`. So
 * an empty array is indistinguishable, at this endpoint, from "every rule on
 * `main` was deleted", which is precisely the 2026-08-07 state. It is reported
 * as a breach naming both causes, and never as a pass. The branch is taken from
 * the repository's own default branch by the workflow, so the benign cause is a
 * misconfiguration of the patrol that its first run would show.
 *
 * ## Statelessness is load-bearing for the schedule
 *
 * Every run re-reads the FULL current membership; nothing here consumes a delta
 * or a cursor. A scheduled tick that GitHub drops or delays therefore costs
 * detection latency and never coverage -- the next tick sees the same breach.
 * `.github/workflows/required-check-set-patrol.yml`'s header states what that
 * does and does not buy against the patrol's own liveness.
