/**
 * objectui#10482 — `PagePreview` decides "record page" from `type` alone.
 *
 * `PageSchema` declares `type` as the page kind and refuses `pageType`, a
 * declared alias of it. The runtime resolver (`usePageAssignment`) reads
 * `type` alone since objectui#9674. The designer preview's `isRecordPage` also
 * read `pageType`, so a raw draft from the JSON source editor (it reaches the
 * preview unparsed) that the `/meta` save would refuse still bound a sample
 * record, and the preview and the runtime disagreed on what a record page is.
 *
 * ## What is observed
 *
 * Record binding has two effects this file can see without reading the
 * component's internals: the sample-record reads it issues through the global
 * `fetch` (the object schema, then its records), and the record context it
 * wraps around the rendered page. Every case mounts through the same
 * `mountAndSettle` window. The `type: 'record'` case is the lit control: it
 * proves that window is long enough to see a binding, so the unbound cases
 * are a reading and not an empty wait.
 *
 * The fixtures are put to the spec's own parser too, so the contract face is
 * measured here rather than quoted: the lit fixture parses, and the alias
 * fixture is refused by key (`unrecognized_keys` naming `pageType`).
