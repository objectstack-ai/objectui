 *           marked fence re-declares a PUBLISHED type without a declared row, or
 *           the marked population SHRANK below `MARKED_FLOOR` (see below).
 *           Everything printed above the summary is a verdict about a guide.
 *       2 = THE GATE COULD NOT RUN, so nothing printed above is a verdict about
 *           any guide: the packages the marked fences import are not built (or
 *           are typed from source), a harness control failed, or the marked
 *           population is empty. Fix the tree and re-run. Never read this as a
 *           guide defect, and never as a pass.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes (objectui#7359)
 *
 * The guides under `skills/objectui/` are the first thing an AI reads when it
 * writes ObjectUI code, and at the branch point they carried 112 `ts` / `tsx` /
 * `typescript` fences and 56 `json` fences. NOT ONE of them was read by any gate
 * in this repository, and every gate that could have reached them excludes the
 * surface by construction rather than by accident:
 *
 *   | gate                          | why it does not reach a fence in `skills/`   |
 *   |-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
 *   | `check-skills-paths.mjs`      | deliberately reads inline code spans in PROSE only — "a fence is a worked example", and a tutorial fence may name a file the reader is about to create |
 *   | `check-doc-links.mjs`         | its `SCAN_ROOTS` has no `skills` row          |
 *   | `check-doc-component-types.mjs` | `DOCS_ROOT = 'content/docs'`, and its header says "not `skills/**`" verbatim |
 *   | `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs` | `content/docs` + the package READMEs + `README.md` |
 *   | `check-doc-fence-languages.mjs` | same surface, and it judges the fence LANGUAGE TAG, never the contents |
 *
 * So this repository enforced path existence in skill prose and nothing else. A
 * fence could import a symbol that does not exist, spell a key the renderer never
 * reads, or restate a shape the spec had changed, and stay green forever. Two
 * rounds of exactly that were already cleaned BY HAND (objectui#3658 / #7094's
 * truth sweep, and #7251's correctness items — which included an eval asserting a
 * mobile hook API with zero occurrences repo-wide), which is precisely the
 * economics `check-skills-paths.mjs` was created to end for paths.
 *
 * ## Opt-in, and why that is the only shape that can start
 *
 * `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs` is opt-OUT: every `ts` fence in a covered
 * document is compiled unless a marker declares it a fragment. That rule is right
 * there and wrong here, and the difference is measurable rather than a matter of
 * taste. The docs corpus was curated into that shape over several cards; the
 * skills corpus never has been. Most of its fences are FRAGMENTS by construction
 * — a `columns: [...]` subtree, a `plugins: [...]` literal, a hook body that
 * continues the block above it, a `vitest` test that imports a dev-only package
 * no consumer of `@object-ui/*` can resolve. Turning all 112 on at once would
 * produce a wall of red on prose that is not wrong, and the reliable outcome of a
 * gate that reds on correct code is that someone deletes it.
 *
 * Hence the convention this file PORTS from objectstack's
 * `packages/spec/scripts/check-skill-examples.ts`: a self-contained,
 * should-hold-up block is opted in by an HTML comment on the line DIRECTLY ABOVE
 * its fence. The marker's exact spelling is in `MARKER` below (a JavaScript block
 * comment cannot quote an HTML comment's closer without confusing a reader
 * grepping for it, so it lives in code, the way
 * `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs` puts its own marker in
 * `FRAGMENT_MARKER_EXAMPLES`).
 *
 * Two properties make the marker safe on this surface, and both are the reason
 * objectstack chose this spelling over a fence-meta tag like ` ```ts check `:
 *
 *   1. It is an HTML comment, so it renders to nothing. A skill guide is read by
 *      an agent as raw markdown and by a human as rendered markdown; neither sees
 *      it.
 *   2. It leaves the fence info string a BARE ` ```typescript `. Three gates in
 *      this repository key on the info string — `check-doc-fence-languages.mjs`
 *      most directly — and a fence-meta tag would have punched a hole in every
 *      one of them.
 *
 * Opt-in also makes the starting population an honest, stated number rather than
 * a wall of exemptions: see "The starting population" below.
 *
 * ## Marker ADJACENCY is strict, and an orphan is a failure
 *
 * The marker must be the line IMMEDIATELY above the fence-open line — not the
 * nearest non-blank line above it. A marker anywhere else is an ORPHAN and fails
 * the run.
 *
 * This is the one rule where being strict costs nothing and being lenient costs
 * everything. A marker separated from its fence by a blank line, or left behind
 * when its fence was deleted or rewritten, is a claim that nothing checks: under
 * a lenient rule it silently opts in NOTHING, and the author who wrote it
 * believes their example is gated. That is the "looks like enforcement, isn't"
 * class this repository has now measured five separate times (objectui#3009,
 * #3181, #3494, #4846, #7115). A stale marker is reported, loudly, with its line
 * number.
 *
 * ## Fence-awareness: a marker shown as EXAMPLE TEXT claims nothing
 *
 * This gate's own convention has to be documentable in the very guides it
 * governs, and in this file's own tests. So a marker line that sits INSIDE some
 * other fenced block — a ```markdown illustration showing what the marker looks
 * like — is at once not an opt-in and not an orphan: it is not at top level, so
 * it claims nothing. `fenceSpans()` answers "which top-level fence owns this
 * line?" for BOTH questions, so the two readings cannot drift apart. The same
 * walk also supplies each fence's CLOSING line, so the body's end is decided by
 * exactly the predicate that decided the fence opened — never by a second,
 * looser closer re-derived at the extraction site (objectstack measured that
 * pair disagreeing on an indented closer and on a CRLF file, in opposite
 * directions).
 *
 * ## How imports resolve: the BUILT dist, exactly like the docs gate
 *
 * A marked `ts` fence is compiled `--strict` against each package's built
 * `dist/*.d.ts`, resolved through the same `paths` map
 * `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs` derives from every package's own `exports` /
 * `types` field, plus that gate's declared-dependency rule for third-party
 * specifiers (a snippet importing `@object-ui/layout` may import `lucide-react`
 * because that package declares it — and may not import a package nothing
 * declares).
 *
 * ⛔ The alternative was mapping `@object-ui/*` to `src/` through the root
 * `tsconfig.json`, and it is rejected for the reason that gate's header
 * states in as many words: the root config maps the workspace to SOURCE, so a
 * harness that inherited it would judge the guides against code no reader
 * resolves — green while the published surface is broken. The reader of a skill
 * guide is a consumer who installs `@object-ui/react` from npm. That is the
 * surface, so that is what is compiled against.
 *
 * ⚠️ That edge USED to be wider, and the `Unmapped specifiers` line printed on
 * every run is what is left of it. A bare specifier that neither the workspace
 * map nor the declared-dependency map covers still resolved if the REPOSITORY
 * ROOT declared it, because pnpm symlinks the root's own dependency set into
 * `/node_modules`: `vitest` and `@playwright/test` are root devDependencies
 * here, so a marked fence importing them was verified against THIS workspace's
 * copy — not against anything a reader of the guide is told to install. The
 * inherited UNDECLARED control never closed that: it bounds resolution against
 * TRANSITIVE packages (which pnpm leaves only under `.pnpm/`), a different leak.
 *
 * objectui#7463 item 2 closed it in the SHARED harness, unconditionally for both
 * gates (maintainer ruling 2026-09-03, objectstack#14909 item 1, option A):
 * `compileSnippets` refuses such a specifier and keeps the fence importing it
 * OUT of the semantic program. The `Unmapped specifiers` line stays, now as the
 * report of what the bound refuses, and the harness's new ROOT-DECLARED control
 * is what proves on every run that it is still being applied.
 *
 * ⚠️ A report OF the refusals has to be read the same way the refusals are, and
 * when the bound landed it was not: the line came from a private regex over the
 * block text while the bound walked the AST, so the two could name different
 * sets over the same fences (objectui#7555). Both now read through the
 * harness's `moduleSpecifiersOfBlock`, so the line cannot name a specifier no
 * fence imports, and the suite pins that the two sets agree over this corpus.
 *
 * ⚠️ A refused fence is NOT type-checked. The four pre-existing ones were
 * carried in the shrink-only `KNOWN_ROOT_DEVDEP_EXAMPLES` below so the bound
 * landed with zero new red, and the `Root bound` and `Semantic phase` lines both
 * say how many fences that costs — a declared row is uncovered debt, never a
 * green. Those four were retired in objectui#7557 by unmarking their fences, so
 * that list is now EMPTY and the bound refuses nothing; see its docblock for the
 * measurement that chose unmarking over declaring, and for when a NEW row is
 * still the right answer.
 *
 * The cost of that decision is the PRECONDITION, and it is a declared exit code
 * rather than a silent green: if a package a marked fence imports has no `dist`,
 * this gate prints `PRECONDITION NOT MET` and exits 2 (`couldNotRun`), never 0
 * and never 1. Zero with nothing run reads as coverage, which is the exact
 * failure shape this whole gate family exists to prevent (objectui#4846). The 1
 * vs 2 split is this repository's convention, not a new one — see
 * `check-eager-closure-budget.mjs` (1 = over budget, 2 = the gauge produced
 * nothing) and `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs`, whose header records three separate
 * agents in one evening each having to notice a printed message before their exit
 * code meant anything.
 *
 * ## What is REUSED, and what is deliberately local
 *
 * The type-check HARNESS is imported from `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs`:
 * `derivePackageTypePaths`, `deriveDeclaredDependencyPaths` and
 * `compileSnippets`. That is not convenience — that harness carries the
 * syntax/semantics split (a `tsc` program with ONE parse error reports no
 * semantic diagnostics at all, program-wide, so an unparseable block must never
 * blind the rest) and the three self-controls (RESOLUTION lands on a built
 * artifact, a planted SENTINEL import must produce TS2305, a POSITIVE control
 * must be clean, and an UNDECLARED specifier must still fail to resolve). A
 * second hand-rolled harness would be a second answer to the same question, and
 * that gate's own header records what hand-rolling it three times cost.
 *
 * What is local is the READING of those controls (`evaluateControls` below) and
 * everything about the marker convention. `scripts/__tests__/check-skill-examples.test.ts`
 * pins that this file imports the shared harness rather than growing its own.
 *
 * ## The starting population (objectui#7359 step 2)
 *
 * `--measure` judges EVERY candidate fence, marked or not, and prints the
 * pass/fail split per language. That is how the marker was landed on exactly the
 * fences that already held up at the branch point, and it stays in the file so
 * the number is re-derivable rather than a claim in a merged PR body.
 *
 * ## The marked population is SHRINK-ONLY (objectui#7550)
 *
 * objectui#7359 landed this gate with no ratchet and no count pin, and said so:
 * whether the marked population becomes shrink-only — the way
 * `check-doc-fence-languages.mjs` treats its declared-file population — was
 * left as a separate decision. That decision is taken: it does, PER CATEGORY,
 * and as a FLOOR rather than an exact pin. `MARKED_FLOOR` below carries one
 * number per marked-fence category, seeded at the population measured at this
 * card's branch point, and a run whose count for a category is BELOW its number
 * exits 1 naming the category, the count, the floor and the two legal moves.
 *
 * A floor and not an equality, because the two directions are not symmetric.
 * Marking one more fence is the direction this whole gate exists to travel, and
 * an exact pin reds on it — a ratchet that goes red on the good move is one
 * people learn to route around, and routing around this one means unmarking.
 * The DOWNWARD move is the one that needs a witness: a marker deleted in the
 * same edit that broke the example it claimed is a red turning green with
 * nothing said, which is the "looks like enforcement, isn't" class this header
 * already records five separate measurements of.
 *
 * ⛔ Deliberately NOT a `file:line` register of which fences carry the marker.
 * That register already exists as `--list`'s output, re-derivable on demand;
 * committing it would red on every guide edit that moves a fence down a line,
 * which teaches precisely the reflex a ratchet must not teach — that going red
 * is normal and the fix is to edit the ratchet.
 *
 * An EMPTY population stays a PRECONDITION rather than becoming a floor breach:
 * a run in which nothing at all is marked exits 2, because a gate that checks
 * nothing must not report success, and that is a statement about the harness or
 * about SCAN_ROOTS rather than a verdict about the corpus. The floor is read
 * only after every precondition has passed, so exit 2 can never be re-labelled
 * as exit 1 by this ratchet.
 *
 * ## The third assertion: no bare `any` in a marked block (objectui#7463)
 *
 * A marker is the author's claim "this block compiles", and the orphan-marker
 * and empty-population guards above exist because a gate that checks nothing
 * must not report success. A bare `any` inside a marked block is that same
 * failure wearing a green badge: every property access on an `any` is
 * unchecked, so `tsc` proves exactly nothing about the lines a reader copies.
 * objectstack's `packages/spec/scripts/check-skill-examples.ts` carries this as
 * its third assertion and records the measured specimen — two marked hook
 * examples annotated `ctx: any` that read a key the hook context does not have,
 * green through the whole of that gate's life.
 *
 * SCOPE, ported from that file rather than re-derived: the annotation must BE
 * `any`, in a position where it erases checking wholesale — a parameter, a
 * variable/property/return annotation, a type alias, or an `as any` /
 * `satisfies any` / angle-bracket assertion. `any` NESTED inside a larger type
 * (`Record<string, any>`, `any[]`, `Promise<any>`) is deliberately NOT flagged.
 * That boundary is the zero-false-positive line, and holding it is what keeps a
 * red meaning broken. Casts and locals are in scope and not for symmetry: a
 * parameter-only rule is defeated by exactly the edit an author reaches for
 * when it goes red — move the `any` one line down (`const c: any = ctx`) or
 * into the access (`(ctx as any).x`) — leaving the gate green over an unchanged
 * defect.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE from objectstack, and it is about which tree is
 * walked. objectstack picks `ScriptKind` off the fence label; the harness THIS
 * gate compiles through parses EVERY block as TSX regardless of label (see
 * `compileSnippets`, and its own header for why). So this walk uses TSX too. A
 * guard that walked a different tree from the one `tsc` judged would be exactly
 * the dormant checker this file's own docblocks warn about. The visible
 * consequence: an angle-bracket `<any>value` assertion is JSX under TSX and is
 * therefore a PARSE failure — already red through the syntax leg, one exit code
 * earlier, never reaching this walk. Its arm is kept in the position table
 * anyway, so the rule stays whole if the harness's ScriptKind ever changes.
 *
 * Parsing, never a regex: the corpus is prose, and `any` occurs in string
 * literal unions, in JSDoc and in ordinary English. `createSourceFile` never
 * throws on malformed input, so a block too broken to parse yields no findings
 * here and is caught by the `tsc` pass — the right division of labour.
 *
 * ⛔ The baseline (`KNOWN_BARE_ANY_EXAMPLES`) is SHRINK-ONLY and is NOT an
 * allowlist: a row whose red is gone fails as STALE. It exists because the
 * assertion landed over a corpus that already had four sites, and unmarking or
 * re-pointing those fences mechanically would have been the gate weakening the
 * guides to suit itself. Each row is a declared debt with a named site, so the
 * per-row skills judgement it needs is a visible piece of work rather than a
 * silent exemption. See the list's own docblock for what each row is.
 *
 * ## The fourth assertion: a marked fence must not SHADOW a published type
 *
 * objectui#7646, and it is the assertion the other three imply. A fence is
 * compiled as a SELF-CONTAINED program, so `tsc` answers "is this snippet
 * internally consistent" and never "does it agree with the type it claims to
 * document". A fence that declares its OWN `type ComponentInput` therefore
 * carries a private copy that can drift arbitrarily far from the published one
 * while this gate stays green — and did: objectui#7636 documented five ADR-0049
 * retirement tombstones as ordinary writable optionals and was green on that
 * fence for the whole time it was wrong.
 *
 * ⭐ The falsification, reproduced on this card's branch point with the mutation
 * confirmed on disk by anchored counts and the restore proven by a blob hash
 * equal to the HEAD blob plus an empty `git diff HEAD`. A fence rewritten as an
 * internally CONSISTENT lie — `name: number` where the published required
 * member is `string`, all five tombstones restored as writable, plus an
 * invented `frobnicate` that exists on no type at all — exits 0, printing
 * `Semantic phase: 13 of 13 ts fence(s) judged, 0 failed`. The fence is INSIDE
 * the judged count. The gate read it and passed it.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONE RECORDED MISS, kept because it is the trap in re-measuring this. An
 * earlier arm left `inputType?: never` in place AND added `inputType?: string`,
 * and went RED with `TS2300` twice and `TS2717`. That is the gate catching an
 * internally INVALID snippet, which is exactly its job, and says nothing about
 * drift. ⛔ A re-measurement that plants an inconsistent lie will conclude the
 * gate works.
 *
 * SCOPE, and it is deliberately the smallest one that closes the class here:
 * the MARKED population only — 3 of the 13 marked fences today, 23% of
 * everything this gate judges. The census behind objectui#7646 found 28
 * shadowing fences over 602 candidates in `skills/`, `.claude/skills/` and
 * `content/docs/`; the 18 under `content/docs/` are `check:doc-snippets`'
 * corpus, where the same blind spot is live because that gate is opt-OUT and
 * compiles them all. ⛔ Widening this assertion into that gate is NOT done here
 * — it is a much larger population and a separate gate-design decision.
 * objectui#7646's triage also ruled out the other direction (converting the
 * fences to imports wholesale): a guide's fence is often a deliberately
 * SIMPLIFIED view of a large published type, so a sweep would make several
 * guides less readable, and that needs per-fence judgement.
 *
 * Which leaves the shape this gate can carry: an offending marked fence must
 * either IMPORT the name (or derive its short shape from it under an alias) or
 * DECLARE, in `KNOWN_SHADOWED_PUBLISHED_TYPES` below, that its copy is a
 * deliberately simplified teaching copy. ⛔ SHRINK-ONLY, and a row is uncovered
 * debt rather than a pass — the summary and the closing line both say so.
 *
 * ⚠️ The rows and NOT the fences, because `skills/**` and `.claude/skills/**`
 * are GOVERNED surfaces (agent drafts, human merges). Editing a fence here
 * would have parked this gate behind a human merge; the repairs are
 * objectui#8335.
 *
 * The oracle is the BUILT surface, not the packages' sources —
 * `derivePublishedTypeNames` states why, and why an inventory that loses its
 * re-export aliases is a CONTROL FAILURE rather than a quiet green.
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT answered here
 *
 *   1. **Whether a marked JSON fence is VALID METADATA.** It is parsed, not
 *      validated against `@object-ui/types`' schemas. Parsing catches the
 *      trailing comma, the smart quote and the truncated object; deciding which
 *      fences are complete documents rather than prose fragments is the same
 *      boundary `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs` left unruled for the same reason,
 *      and guessing it is what produces a gate people learn to ignore.
 *   2. **Whether a REFUSED fence's example is correct.** The root bound says
 *      only that this gate cannot reach the package the fence imports, never
 *      that the fence is wrong — the four rows it once declared were good
 *      documentation about test runners the reader installs, which is why
 *      objectui#7557 retired them by unmarking the fences rather than by editing
 *      the examples. Retiring a row means giving the example an import the
 *      reader provably has, or the guide's owner deciding the fence should not
 *      be gated; both are skills judgements over a GOVERNED surface, made in a
 *      skills PR.
 *   3. **Whether an eval's `must_contain` token is taught by the guides.** A
 *      different oracle over a different corpus, discussed at length on
 *      objectui#7359 and explicitly not this check.

/**
 * The prose roots this gate walks: the PUBLISHED skill bundle, and the

 * that "covered by default" meant "covered if the filename ends in `.mdx`".
 *
 * `.claude/skills` was added by objectui#7463 item 3, the same widening
 * `check-skills-paths.mjs` took in objectui#7358 and for the same reason: when
 * objectui#7251 moved the two contributor-only guides out of `skills/`, that
 * gate simply stopped looking at them and nothing turned red. A gate whose scan
 * root is narrower than the surface it claims silently un-covers whatever moves
 * out of it.
 *
 * ⚠️ WIDENING A ROOT IS NOT ARMING IT. Opt-in is the whole design here, so this
 * edit adds candidates, not coverage: nothing under `.claude/skills/**` carries
 * the marker, and adding one is the surface owner's step, not this widening's.
 * Measured at objectui#7463's head, which is the number that makes "zero new

 *   • FEWER is RED, and the remedy is to lower the number here IN THE SAME PULL
 *     REQUEST that removes the marker, ⛔ with the reason written beside the

 * The first lowering is `ts` 17 -> 13 (objectui#7557), and its reason is on the

 * to withdraw the claim in the guide, not to carry it as debt forever.
 *
 * ## What this floor counts, and what the OTHER ratchet counts
 *
 * MARKS, not verifications. A fence the shared harness's ROOT BOUND refuses
 * (see `KNOWN_ROOT_DEVDEP_EXAMPLES` below) keeps its marker and stays inside
 * this floor while being type-checked by nothing at all, so this number cannot
 * be read as coverage — the `Root bound` and `Semantic phase` lines in the same
 * summary are what say how many marked fences were actually reached.
 *
 * ⛔ The two ratchets are deliberately not one. Deleting a marker to silence a
 * root-bound refusal would lower THIS floor, which is exactly the move both of
 * them exist to make visible: the debt list refuses to let the refusal go
 * unnamed, and the floor refuses to let the population shrink quietly.

 *
 *     GUIDE:FENCELINE POSITION
 *
 * where POSITION is `describeAnyPosition()`'s own wording, so a row names one
 * `any` at one site and a per-row fix removes exactly one line. Two `any`s of
 * different kinds in one fence are two rows; the fence line disambiguates two
 * of the SAME kind in different fences.
 *
 * ⚠️ Not an allowlist. A row whose red is GONE fails as STALE, so the list can
 * only shrink — the same direction, and the same reasoning, as
 * `KNOWN_UNTAUGHT_EVAL_TOKENS` in `check-skill-eval-tokens.mjs`. It is keyed on
 * the fence LINE, which means moving a guide's prose above the fence forces a
 * re-declaration. That cost is deliberate: a row that floated free of its line
 * would keep covering a site nobody has looked at since.
 *
 * The corpus at objectui#7463's branch point was FOUR rows, measured under
 * `--measure` before the assertion was armed. All four are retired, and none of
 * them by a mechanical unmark.
 *
 * The three `testing.md` rows were retired by objectui#7494, which answered the
 * skills judgement each of them was waiting on and taught the honest idiom in
 * their place — the schema fence hands the validator its invalid value with no
 * assertion at all (the parameter takes it as-is), and the adapter fence doubles
 * through the public `getClient()` seam instead of reaching the private `client`
 * field through a cast. Both fences stay MARKED; the rows went in the same
 * commit as the guide edit, because a row whose red is gone fails as STALE.
 *
 * The fourth — `plugin-development.md:92` `defaultValue` — was retired the same
 * way by the fence repair. Its reason had gone out of date under it: the row
 * said the guide was FAITHFUL prose because `ComponentInput.defaultValue`
 * "really is `any`", and it is not — the platform type has carried it as an
 * ADR-0049 retirement tombstone (`defaultValue?: never`) for some time, so the
 * guide's `any` was rot after all, and the honest fix WAS to the guide. That
 * fence now imports `ComponentInput` instead of re-declaring it, which removes
 * the `any` along with the copy. The list is empty; an empty shrink-only list is
 * the terminal state it is shaped for, not a disabled one.

/**
 * ⛔ SHRINK-ONLY. Rows spelled exactly as `rootDevDepRowKey()` builds them:
 *
 *     GUIDE:FENCELINE SPECIFIER
 *
 * so a row names ONE fence importing ONE specifier the shared harness's root
 * bound refuses (see `resolvesOnlyThroughRootManifest` in
 * `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs`). A fence importing two such specifiers is two
 * rows, and a per-row fix removes exactly one import.
 *
 * ⚠️ Not an allowlist, and it does NOT re-open resolution: a declared row's
 * fence is still refused by the harness and is NOT type-checked — the run's
 * `Semantic phase` count says so out loud. What the row buys is that a
 * PRE-EXISTING one is not a new red on the day the bound landed; what it costs
 * is the fence's coverage, which is the honest price of an example resting on a
 * package the gate cannot show the reader has.
 *
 * A row whose refusal is GONE fails as STALE, so the list can only shrink — the
 * same direction, and the same reasoning, as `KNOWN_BARE_ANY_EXAMPLES` above.
 *
 * The corpus at the bound's branch point was FOUR rows, all in one guide, all
 * measured before the bound was armed:
 *
 *   - `testing.md:60`, `:94`, `:218` imported `vitest`, and `:258` imported
 *     `@playwright/test`. Both are TEST RUNNERS the reader installs in their own
 *     project — the guide's first sentence names both — and no package this
 *     repository publishes declares either, so nothing in the map covered them.
 *     They compiled until the bound only because THIS repository carries both as
 *     root devDependencies, which is the leak the bound closed.
 *
 * ## The list is EMPTY, and that is the terminal state (objectui#7557)
 *
 * All four rows are retired. The bound's own card left the choice to the guide's
 * owner and it was made by MEASUREMENT rather than by taste: this gate reads
 * exactly ONE declaration on a fence — `MARKER` above, an exact-string match on
 * the whole line, with no reason field, no install field and no capture group —
 * and `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs`'s `FRAGMENT_MARKER` is not read here at all.
 * The bound itself (`resolvesOnlyThroughRootManifest`) is a pure function of the
 * specifier and two repository-wide maps, with no per-block parameter to declare
 * into. So there was no form in which a fence could keep its mark and name its
 * install, and the four fences were unmarked in `testing.md` with the reason
 * written beside each. `MARKED_FLOOR` above records the matching `ts` 17 -> 13.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is NOT the precedent it can be misread as. Unmarking to silence a red
 * is the "gate weakens the guide to suit itself" move these shrink-only lists
 * exist to prevent, and it stays refused. What was withdrawn here was different:
 * a mark over a fence the harness REFUSES is a claim no run can honour — those
 * four were type-checked by nothing at all for the whole of their life as rows,
 * and the summary said so on every run. The two ratchets still count different
 * things on purpose, and neither substitutes for the other.
 *
 * A NEW row may still be declared if the bound ever refuses a marked fence
 * again — the machinery below is live, and `judge()` reds an undeclared refusal.
 * But a row is uncovered debt, never a green, so the first question stays: can
 * this example import what the reader provably has? Declare a row only when the
 * answer is no AND the fence must keep its mark for some reason this comment
 * does not anticipate; otherwise unmark it here, the way these four were.

// ── The published-type SHADOWING assertion (objectui#7646) ───────────────────

/**
 * Every type and interface name the BUILT `@object-ui/*` surface publishes,
 * keyed to the entry specifiers that publish it.
 *
 * ## Why the published surface and not each package's own `src` tree
 *
 * objectui#7646's census matched fences against the type names exported by the
 * packages' SOURCES, and that is the right instrument for a census: it needs no
 * build and it cannot miss anything. It is the wrong oracle for a GATE here,
 * for the reason this file's header already gives for compiling against `dist`
 * — the reader of a skill guide is a consumer who installs `@object-ui/react`
 * from npm, so that is the surface, and an assertion that judged the guides
 * against code no reader resolves would be the exact thing the header rejects.
 *
 * It is also the difference between a remedy that exists and one that does not.
 * The finding's remedy is "import it", and a name a package declares internally
 * but never re-exports cannot be imported by anyone. Measured at this card's
 * branch point: of the 26 distinct shadowed names the census found, 25 are on
 * the published surface and one — `NavigationContextType`, internal to
 * `packages/app-shell/src/context/NavigationContext.tsx` — is not. Against a
 * source-derived oracle that row would be red with no legal fix.
 *
 * ## Not a second harness
 *
 * This builds its own tiny program, and that is not the "second answer to the
 * same question" this file's header warns about, because it is a different
 * question. `compileSnippets` asks "does this snippet type-check"; this asks
 * "what does the published surface NAME". It reads only `.d.ts` entry points,
 * emits nothing, judges no snippet, and resolves through each package's own
 * `exports`/`types` — the same artifacts the shared harness resolves to.
 *
 * ⚠️ An `export type { X } from './y.js'` re-export is an ALIAS symbol, whose
 * own flags carry neither `Interface` nor `TypeAlias`. A first cut of this
 * function filtered on those flags without following the alias and silently
 * lost 1167 of 1458 names — every barrel re-export in the workspace, including
 * `AuthUser`, which is one of the three offenders this assertion exists to
 * catch. That is why `viaAlias` is counted and why a run in which it is ZERO is
 * a CONTROL FAILURE rather than a green: it is the one way this inventory can
 * collapse while still looking like it worked.
 *
 * ## The coverage this cannot have, stated rather than hidden
 *
 * A package whose `dist` is not on disk contributes nothing, and this gate
 * deliberately builds only the closure its fences import (`--build-filter`,
 * objectui#7811) rather than the whole workspace. So the returned `absent` list
 * is printed on every run: a name only an UNBUILT package publishes is
 * invisible to this assertion. Making it a precondition instead would force
 * every run to build every package and undo that scoping; naming it is this
 * repository's convention for a bound a gate cannot close.
 *
 * Memoised on the entry set, because `judge()` is called more than once in the
 * self-test and this program costs seconds, not milliseconds.

 * ⛔ SHRINK-ONLY. Rows spelled exactly as `shadowedTypeRowKey()` builds them:
 *
 *     GUIDE:FENCELINE NAME
 *
 * mapped to the REASON this fence keeps its private copy, and the card that
 * owns the repair. One row names ONE shadowed name in ONE fence, so a fence
 * shadowing two published types is two rows and a per-row fix removes exactly
 * one declaration.
 *
 * ## What a row declares, and what it does NOT buy
 *
 * A row is the explicit half of objectui#7646's graded remedy: a marked fence
 * that re-declares a published name must either IMPORT that name or SAY, here,
 * that its copy is a deliberately simplified teaching copy. What the row buys
 * is that a pre-existing offender is not new red on the day this assertion
 * landed. What it costs is exactly what the finding measured — the fence is
 * still compiled as a self-contained program, so `tsc` still judges only
 * whether it is internally consistent and never whether it agrees with the type
 * it is titled after. ⛔ A row is uncovered debt, never a green, and the run's
 * summary says so out loud.
 *
 * ## Why every row is one, and why none of them is a fence edit
 *
 * `skills/**` and `.claude/skills/**` are GOVERNED surfaces — agent drafts,
 * human merges (`scripts/check-governed-queue-guard.mjs`'s `GOVERNED_SURFACES`).
 * The pull request that landed this assertion touches `scripts/` only; a fence
 * edit in it would have parked the gate behind a human merge. The repairs are
 * objectui#8335, which parks for a maintainer by design.
 *
 * ## It reds in four directions, and the fourth is the one keys are shaped for
 *
 *   1. an offender with NO row — the assertion itself;
 *   2. a row whose fence now IMPORTS the name — STALE, because the debt is paid
 *      and a row that outlives its defect is an exemption nobody re-reads;
 *   3. a row whose fence is GONE (deleted, unmarked, or moved down the file) —
 *      STALE for the same reason, and the fence LINE in the key is what makes a
 *      moved fence force a re-declaration, exactly as `KNOWN_BARE_ANY_EXAMPLES`
 *      does;
 *   4. a row whose SHADOWED NAME changed — which needs no extra machinery,
 *      because the name is IN the key: the old row goes stale and the new name
 *      arrives undeclared, so one edit reds twice and says both halves.
 *
 * Four rows were seeded here, measured under `--measure` on this gate's branch
 * point (`fedfa3e4a`), where the census found 3 of the 13 marked fences
 * shadowing a published name — 23% of everything this gate judges. ALL FOUR ARE
 * RETIRED: objectui#8335 gave each of those three fences one of the per-fence
 * judgements objectui#7646's triage laid down, and all three came out as
 * IMPORT, in the same commit as this list shrank to nothing. What the rows
 * bought was measurable at the moment they went: each of the three copies had
 * drifted, and two of them held claims that were flatly false against the
 * published surface — `AuthUser` still taught a `roles` member ADR-0090 D3 had
 * renamed away, and `ComponentInput` declared `label`, `defaultValue` and
 * `advanced` as writable where all three are `never` tombstones.
 *
 * An EMPTY list is the terminal state this shape is for, not a disabled one:
 * the assertion is unchanged and a new offender still reds on sight. The next
 * marked fence that re-declares a published name has no row to hide behind.

 *   - a marked fence that HOLDS UP must pass (a harness broken the other way
 *     reds every guide at once and reads as "the guides are full of defects");
 *   - a marked fence that is BROKEN must fail (without it the gate is a rubber
 *     stamp);
 *   - a marker NOT adjacent to a fence must be reported (the stale-marker case:
 *     lenient adjacency opts in nothing while the author believes otherwise);
 *   - an UNMARKED broken fence must be ignored (opt-in is the whole design; if
 *     this leaks the gate reds on day one on prose that is not wrong).
 *
 * Plus the two the design turns on and nobody would think to write down: a
 * marker shown as EXAMPLE TEXT inside another fence claims nothing and is not an
 * orphan either, and a marker above a ```bash fence IS an orphan.
 *
 * The bare-`any` guard (objectui#7463) is pinned on BOTH edges here, and the
 * negative edge is the load-bearing one: ten in-scope positions must be found
 * and six nested `any`s must NOT be, because that boundary is the whole reason
 * a red from this assertion means something. Its shrink-only baseline is pinned
 * in both directions too — a declared row suppresses, and a row whose red is
 * gone is STALE.
