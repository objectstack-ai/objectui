 * ⭐ THE CHEAP DEFENCE-IN-DEPTH PIN — objectui#6837 half 2.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-31 (第 6 场总监席决裁批 #14). The half-2 delivery
 * requirement, 原文照录:
 *
 * > 防御深度钉(便宜):读者遇到遗留键时 dev 模式警告一次并指向本裁定——协议之
 * > 外的键不解析,但不无声。
 *
 * Half 2 deleted the per-reader `reference_to` fallback arms. What makes that
 * deletion survivable for a BYO host is the ingestion choke point, which stamps
 * `reference` from whichever spelling arrived. But a choke point that absorbs a
 * producer's bug SILENTLY is the AGENTS.md #0.1 failure mode by another name —
 * so it now says so, once, in dev.
 *
 * ## What each case here is actually measuring
 *
 * The three pins the card names, plus the two controls without which they would
 * be satisfiable by a warning that never fires (or one that fires always):
 *
 *   1. fires on a legacy-only def          — the pin
 *   2. does NOT fire on a canonical def    — the negative control
 *   3. does NOT fire twice                 — the flood control
 *   4. names the field and the ruling      — the message is the deliverable,
 *                                            not the call count
 *   5. the STAMP is unchanged              — the guard that this file is
 *                                            testing an addition, not a
 *                                            behaviour change
 *
 * ⚠️ Case 5 is the one that would go missing. The ruling asked for an audible
 * warning, NOT for the normalizer to start refusing anything: the def must
 * still come out carrying both snake_case keys exactly as before. A warning
 * that also dropped the key would pass 1-4 and be a regression.
 *
 * ## Warn-once GRANULARITY — the memo key, stated exactly, and pinned
 *
 * The card says "once-per-process". This implementation memoises per
 * **(object name, field name, legacy spelling, target value)**, and every
 * segment of that key is pinned below in both directions so the granularity is
 * a measured fact rather than a claim in a comment:
 *
 *   same object+field+spelling+value, twice   -> ONE warning
 *   same field+spelling, DIFFERENT value      -> TWO warnings
 *   same field+spelling+value, TWO OBJECTS    -> TWO warnings, each naming its object
 *   a def normalized with no object in scope  -> warns under a placeholder
 *
 * ⚠️ An earlier revision keyed on (field, spelling, value) with no object
 * segment and no object in the message. It was described in the PR and the
 * changeset as "per (field name, legacy spelling)" — which was wrong twice over:
 * it under-reported (the value was in the key, so one field with two stale
 * targets warned twice) AND it over-reported (the same field name on N objects
 * collided into ONE warning that could not say which object). Neither behaviour
 * was pinned, because the original pins held the value constant and used
 * distinct field names — so both were invisible. The object segment closes the
 * gap; these tests exist so the next revision cannot reopen it silently.
 *
 * ## ⛔ WHAT THIS WARNING DOES NOT COVER
 *
 * It fires only where `normalizeSchemaReferenceKeys` runs, which in production
 * is exactly the three ingestion choke points (objectui#7650 added the third,
 * `MetadataProvider.getItem`) — all of which also STAMP the def, so it fires
 * where nothing is broken. A hand-written schema served through any
 * other `DataSource` reaches a reader raw and warns nothing. The reader-side
 * diagnostic that would cover that is still open on objectui#6837.
