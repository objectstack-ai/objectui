 * objectui#7429 — field-level security on `ObjectTimeline`'s `$expand`.
 *
 * ## The site, and why it is the sharp one
 *
 * objectui#7215 / PR #7229 and objectui#7230 / PR #7428 gated `$expand` at six
 * of the helper's production call sites. This is one of the seven objectui#7429
 * recorded as still ungated. It passes **no column list at all**:
 *
 *     const expand = buildExpandFields(objectDef?.fields);
 *
 * `buildExpandFields` reads an absent column list as "no column restriction"
 * and falls back to **every declared relation on the object**, denied ones
 * included. So a standalone timeline does not merely fail to filter a column
 * list — it has none, and therefore asks the server to resolve the maximum
 * possible set of relations by default. That is the ordinary shape of this
 * surface, not a corner of it.
 *
 * ⛔ EXPANDING IS NOT GATING. `ObjectTimeline.fetchGate-7895.test.tsx` asserts
 * the separate, non-overlapping concern of HOW MANY queries go out and WHEN.
 * This file asserts only WHICH relations the settled query's `$expand` names.
 *
 * ## Grading — defence-in-depth, stated the same way #7215 / #7230 stated it
 *
 * Against ObjectStack's own server this is not a live disclosure:
 * `plugin-security`'s `FieldMasker.maskRecord` does `delete result[field]` on
 * every unreadable key and objectql's expand path writes the resolved record
 * back under THAT SAME KEY, so one statement removes the expanded object and
 * the bare id alike; the expansion sub-read itself takes the referenced
 * object's full CRUD + RLS + FLS treatment (objectstack#7626). It is
 * load-bearing for a backend that does not strip, and the client-request side
 * is real regardless: this component asks the server to resolve relations the
 * current principal cannot read.
 *
 * ## The gate goes on the OUTPUT of `buildExpandFields` — copied, not re-derived
 *
 * PR #7229 settled the shape and PR #7428 applied it unchanged at four more
 * sites. On THIS site the input-gating route is not merely unsound, it is
 * unreachable: the call passes `undefined`, so there is no input to gate.
 * Gating the output also makes the "`checkField` answers false for an
 * undeclared key" trap structurally unreachable, because `buildExpandFields`
 * returns a subset of the object's DECLARED reference-bearing fields — every
 * name the gate judges is declared by construction.
 *
 * ## Why the stub `checkField` is an ALLOWLIST
 *
 * Inherited from `expandFls-7215.test.tsx` for its reason: the real
 * `PermissionProvider` answers `true` for a field no policy mentions, so a
 * denial has to be modelled by a stub that ENUMERATES readable fields — the
 * shape a server reporting field permissions actually has.
