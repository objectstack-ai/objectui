### Minor Changes

- 7c3df8f: A non-grid view's fetch now carries a platform row ceiling, and crossing it is
  never silent (objectui#7210, maintainer ruling a′, 2026-09-02).
  
  Before this, `ObjectGantt`, `ObjectCalendar`, `ObjectMap` and `ObjectTree` each
  issued a `find` with **no `$top` at all**, so the request returned the entire
  filtered result set. At the 186 rows the card was filed from that is invisible;
  on an object with 100k scheduled rows it is the whole table into the browser,
  and nothing an author could write — `pagination.pageSize` included — could
  bound a request that never carried a cap to begin with.
  
  **What changed.** Those four fetches now ask for `NON_GRID_ROW_CEILING_TOP`
  rows, draw at most `NON_GRID_ROW_CEILING` of them, and when the result set was
  larger they render a footnote naming both numbers, verbatim as it renders:
  *"Showing the first 2000 of 41234 records. Narrow the filter."* Below the
  ceiling nothing changes: the full set draws and no footnote appears.
  
  The four view packages take a **minor**, not a patch: a result set above the
  ceiling is no longer drawn in full, which is a behaviour break whatever the
  fixed group does to the released version number.
  
  **The ceiling is a platform constant, not an authorable key** — `2000`, exported
  from `@object-ui/react` as `NON_GRID_ROW_CEILING`. An authored `limit` or
  `dataSource: { limit }` still does not reach these queries, by the same ruling;
  three alternatives were rejected with it (a documentation note only — still the
  whole table; truncating at `pageSize` — silent, and a complete schedule capped
  at one page; an authorable `maxRows` — a new permanent key every author sets).
  
  **Why 2,000.** One constant for all four, so the binding view sets it. Measured
  in this repo's jsdom lane: gantt, calendar and map hold their DOM flat as rows
  grow (virtualised task list; four events per day cell; auto-clustering above
  100 markers), while `ObjectTree` flattens every expanded node into the document
  at a linear **5.2 DOM elements per record** with no virtualisation. 2,000 rows
  is where the worst of the four lands at ~10,400 elements — an order of
  magnitude above Lighthouse's "excessive DOM size" warning, and still ~10x the
  real application result set this card came from.
  
  New exports on `@object-ui/react`: `NON_GRID_ROW_CEILING`,
  `NON_GRID_ROW_CEILING_TOP`, `applyNonGridRowCeiling`, `NonGridRowCeilingNote`
  and the type `NonGridCeilingResult`. Two new `common.*` i18n keys carry the
  footnote copy in all ten packs.
- b041b9c: `@object-ui/core` publishes `resolveRecordSourceObjectName`, the ONE reader for "which
  object is this block bound to" (objectui#7627).
  
  Six view plugins each spelled that resolution locally — `ObjectCalendar` twice,
  `ObjectGantt`, `ObjectTree` twice, `ObjectMap`, `ObjectGrid` — and had drifted: three
  wrote `?? schema.objectName`, one `|| ''`, one `: undefined`, one an `'object' in
  dataConfig` test. They now delegate to one function that states the published
  objectui#6939 record-source ladder (`data`, then `staticData`, then `objectName`) once.
  
  **No behaviour changes.** Each site's pre-collapse expression is transcribed verbatim
  into `record-source.behaviourNeutrality-7627.test.ts` and asserted equal to its
  post-collapse spelling across the whole contract-valid input matrix — both bindings
  present, data only, `objectName` only, empty `objectName`, empty `data.object`, the
  `api` / `value` / `staticData` / array-shorthand providers, and nothing bound.
  
  **Two questions stay two questions.** `normalizeListViewSchema`'s gap-fill (#7477,
  ruling B of PR #7628) is untouched and is NOT re-pointed at the new reader: it answers
  how `objectName` gets POPULATED when absent, where an already-present `objectName` wins.
  The new reader answers which object a block RESOLVES, where the `data` block wins — the
  order declared on both published faces in `@object-ui/types` and pinned by
  `objectql-record-source-refinement-6939.test.ts`. Merging them would silently override
  one standing ruling or the other.
  
  **`ObjectGantt`'s `persistLayoutKey` is deliberately excluded** and keeps its inverted
  order, with an in-place comment saying why: its receiver is a localStorage key
  (`gantt-layout:KEY:filters`), not a record source, so re-pointing it would orphan every
  saved layout and filter-chip set of a view carrying both bindings. Two more sites the
  finding listed are not object-name readers at all and were struck: `ObjectGantt`'s
  refresh-handler predicate (`object` OR `api`) and `plugin-dashboard`'s `isObjectProvider`
  type-guard over a widget's `data`.
  
  `useSettledSchema`'s doc comment stops prescribing the hand-written ladder at all four
  lines that taught it, so the copies cannot re-seed from the hook that replaced them.

### Patch Changes

- 39f4309: Published typings from every `vite-plugin-dts` package now carry an explicit extension on
  every relative specifier, and a type error in the declaration build now fails the build
  instead of being printed and ignored (objectui#5439, objectui#5483).
  
  **Consumers on `moduleResolution: nodenext` or `node16` may see NEW type errors, and that
  is the fix working.** These packages re-export mostly through NAMED re-exports —
  `export { useObjectChat } from './useObjectChat'`. TypeScript could not follow the
  extensionless hop, but it still DECLARED the name, so the symbol resolved to a silent
  `any`. Nothing errored; consumers simply got no types. With the extension emitted, the
  symbol carries its real type, and any call site that was relying on the `any` now type
  checks for the first time. This is the mode that produced the 21 residual `TS7006` on
  `@object-ui/app-shell` reported against objectui#5365 — a type hole that opened quietly,
  unlike objectui#5365's own `export * from './ui'` packages where the same defect surfaced
  immediately as `TS2305: has no exported member`.
  
  410 extensionless relative specifiers across 19 packages were emitted before this change;
  the count is now 0 in all 22 packages that build typings through `vite-plugin-dts`.
  `@object-ui/fields` was already clean — its sources write explicit `.js` specifiers — and
  is wired so it stays that way.
  
  The second half changes no emitted output today: 22/22 packages built green unmodified, so
  making the declaration step's exit code honest turns nothing red. It changes what a FUTURE
  regression does — print and exit 0, versus fail the build.
- 0a2918f: The package README stops documenting a marker-title fallback that objectui#5953 replaced.
  
  `README.md`'s `map` block table described `titleField` as: "Omitted, markers are
  titled `Marker`." That was true of the pre-#5953 read site, which bound the
  marker title to a field name directly. objectui#5953 moved the marker title onto
  `@object-ui/core`'s `getRecordDisplayName`, and `'Marker'` is now passed only as
  that resolver's `fallback` option — a position the resolver reaches **only for a
  record carrying no id at all**. A record with an id and no resolvable name reads
  `Record #<id>`; a record whose object declares a `nameField` or a `titleFormat`,
  or which simply carries a name-ish key, reads that. So "omitted ⇒ `Marker`" was
  true in one narrow corner and false in the common case, and an author reading the
  row would either under-specify `titleField` for a reason that stopped being true
  or over-specify it to avoid a `Marker` that would never have appeared.
  
  The row now names the precedence an omitted `titleField` hands the decision to:
  the declared `nameField`, its deprecated `displayNameField` alias, the legacy
  `titleFormat` template, a type-aware pick from the object's fields, then
  name-ish keys read straight off the record — with `Record #<id>` as the floor and
  `Marker` reached only by an id-less record.
  
  Two details the row states deliberately:
  
  - It does **not** describe an object-level `objectDef.titleField` rung. The
    resolver consulted one at step 0 as a second `??` leg, but objectui#6531 (PR
    #6560) removes it — `@objectstack/spec`'s object schema is a `strictObject`
    that rejects the key with `unrecognized_keys`, so no producer can ship it.
    What survives is `options.titleField`, which is exactly what `map.titleField`
    becomes at `ObjectMap`'s call site, so "a declared `titleField` wins" stays
    true either way and the row does not go stale when that lands.
  - It names the record-key probe (the resolver's step 4b) as its own rung. That
    is not a footnote for this component: `ObjectMap` fetches an object schema
    only when `!hasInlineData && dataSource`, so for `staticData` or an inline
    `data` array no object definition ever reaches the resolver and the record-key
    probe is the only rung that can produce a title —
    `ObjectMap.markerTitle.test.tsx` pins exactly that case.
  
  A second row falsified by the same commit goes with it. Two lines below the table,
  the field-name defaults paragraph listed what an unconfigured map falls back to as
  "`latitude` / `longitude` / `location` / `name` / `description`". objectui#5953 removed
  the title default: `getMapConfig`'s default branch returns coordinate keys and
  `descriptionField` only, under a comment that spells out why — "Deliberately NO
  `titleField` (objectui#5953)… `getRecordDisplayName` resolves it from the object
  definition, and it does so better than any literal here could". The paragraph now
  lists the four defaults that exist and says where an unconfigured marker's title
  actually comes from. Left alone in the same sentence: `map: { titleField: 'name' }`
  still names no coordinate field and still renders an empty map, which is accurate.
  
  Prose only: no behaviour changes, and the placeholders were already pinned in
  order by `ObjectMap.markerTitle.test.tsx`.
- f9653ae: Re-key the load-bearing fetch effects in `ObjectMap`, `ObjectCalendar` and
  `ObjectGantt` onto the primitive fields they actually read off `dataConfig`
  (`provider` / `object` / `items`) instead of the whole memoised `dataConfig`
  object (objectui#6592, the deferred half of objectui#6270/PR #6591).
  `ObjectTree` is a census member too but is deferred out of this change — see
  the PR body — because its own fetch effects are the surface of PR #6696
  (objectui#6481), open at the same time.
  
  `useMemo` carries no semantic guarantee — React is permitted to discard a
  memo cache and recompute even when its dependency array compares equal to
  the previous render, and the local `getDataConfig(schema)` helper each of
  these renderers carries builds a fresh `{ provider, object }` /
  `{ provider, items }` wrapper object on every call. So a fetch effect keyed
  on `dataConfig` itself was correct only for as long as that identity
  happened to survive a discard: a recompute alone (no author or caller
  action) was enough to re-run the effect and issue an extra
  `dataSource.find` / `dataSource.getObjectSchema` call. Keying the effects
  on the primitives instead makes a cache discard a no-op, restoring
  `useMemo` to a pure optimisation.
  
  `ObjectGantt`'s `effectiveDataSource` memo deliberately keeps `dataConfig`
  as a dependency (`resolveDataSource` needs the whole provider-shaped
  value — the `api` provider's `read`/`write` request config cannot be
  flattened to a fixed primitive list the way `object`/`value` can), so its
  `reload()` fetch is decoupled from the redundant direct `dataConfig`
  dependency but not from `effectiveDataSource`'s own; for the `object`/`value`
  providers `resolveDataSource` returns its `fallback`/a fresh
  `ValueDataSource` respectively rather than reading further into the config,
  which is enough for the two fetch effects to observe no extra call under a
  recomputed-but-equivalent `dataConfig` in the common case.
  
  No behaviour change for a schema whose `useMemo` caches survive normally;
  the effects are unaffected by React discarding one.
- 3beef6d: The spec's `dataSource` element binding is now DECLARED by the blocks that read
  it, so the html tier stops reporting the one working saved-view spelling as
  `unknown-prop` (objectui#6678).
  
  `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` — `{ object, view, filter, sort, limit }` — is
  the one spelling that resolves a saved view for an object-bound block. It works,
  and it drew the identical `unknown-prop` warning as the two spellings that do
  nothing (`viewName`, `view`), because `validateTree` looks a prop up in the
  block's declared `inputs` and no registration declared this key. On the tier
  built to accept AI-authored pages, where the diagnostic IS the contract, the
  only signal pointed away from the key that works.
  
  Adopting the maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29 — option B **in the injection
  form**:
  
  - `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT` is the single declaration, in `@object-ui/core`
    beside the binding's own semantics; `Registry.register` emits it for any
    registration whose renderer passed through the new `elementDataSourceBlock()`
    seam. One mechanism, one copy — not a hand-kept declaration per block, which is
    the shape that drifts and that a new block forgets. The seam lives in
    `@object-ui/core` and is re-exported by `@object-ui/react` beside
    `ElementDataSourceGate` for discoverability; call sites take the core import,
    because a registration runs at module scope and this repo's suites partially
    mock `@object-ui/react`.
  - Seventeen renderers, in thirteen files across twelve packages, reach the seam
    and now publish the key to the save gate, the parser whitelist, the generated
    JSX authoring types and the block list. The card named nine blocks; the tree
    also has `plugin-grid`, `plugin-timeline`, two further `plugin-form` blocks and
    `element:record_picker` — nothing was hand-listed, so the mechanism covered
    them. `element:record_picker` consumes the gate's HOOK and status panels rather
    than the wrapper tag (its object lives under `properties`), and was found by a
    render probe rather than by reading sources.
  - `dataSource` on a block that does NOT read it (`flex`, `card`) still reports
    `unknown-prop`. Adding the key to `sdui-parser`'s `BASE_PROPS` was refused for
    exactly this reason — that set mirrors `BaseSchema`, and silencing the key
    everywhere would make the diagnostic lie in the other direction.
  - New `check:element-data-source-declaration` fails any source that consumes the
    gate without reaching the seam, so a block added tomorrow cannot forget.
  
  Behaviour of the binding itself is unchanged — this is a declaration, not a
  resolution change. The saved view still resolves its columns, and an
  unresolvable `view` still fails loudly rather than widening to the object's full
  scope.
  
  The spec/registry parity gates (repo-wide and the `record:related_list` per-block
  pin) now derive their accepted set from the WHOLE node contract rather than from
  `ComponentPropsMap[type]` alone. `PageComponentSchema` accepts and keeps
  `dataSource` on a page-component node — it is a node-level key, a sibling of
  `type` and `className`, not a per-block prop — so the gates' previous complaint
  was measurably wrong. Derived from the spec, not exempted, and both still
  discriminate against an invented key.
- d327b9c: FLS-gate the `$expand` projection at the seven remaining `buildExpandFields`
  call sites (objectui#7429).
  
  objectui#7215 / PR #7229 gated the two projection sites in its scope
  (`ObjectGrid`, `ListView`). objectui#7230 / PR #7428 gated four more
  (`ObjectCalendar`, `ObjectGantt`, `RecordDetailView`, `DetailView`). This
  closes the seven that were left: `ObjectKanban`, `ObjectTree`, `ObjectView`
  (the non-grid record-fetch effect), `ObjectMap`, `ObjectGallery`,
  `ObjectTimeline`, and the metadata-admin `PagePreview`'s record-binding fetch.
  
  **All seven pass no column list at all**, which makes every one of them the
  sharp shape: `buildExpandFields` reads an absent column list as "no column
  restriction" and falls back to **every declared relation on the object**,
  denied ones included. So each of these components asked the server to resolve
  the object's full relation set by default, not by configuration — the
  ordinary shape of each surface, not a corner of it.
  
  **`PagePreview` is the one site where the judged principal is not the page's
  eventual audience.** It calls the browser's own `fetch` with
  `credentials: 'include'` rather than `DataSource.find`, so it runs under
  whichever session is loading the Studio preview. Gating on that same session's
  `usePermissions()` is still the correct principal: it is exactly the request
  the browser is about to make, on its own credentials, regardless of who later
  opens the published page.
  
  **Reproduced before it was fixed**, as a failing test per site (and, for the
  two sites — `ObjectView`, `PagePreview` — where the gate was implemented
  before its test was run red, a reverse-verification: the gate was reverted,
  all four denial-and-set pins on each went red, and the two deferral/positive
  control pins stayed green, before the gate was restored).
  
  **Grading, measured rather than assumed** — the same reading objectui#6898,
  #7215 and #7230 recorded: against ObjectStack's own server this is
  defence-in-depth, not a live disclosure. `plugin-security`'s
  `FieldMasker.maskRecord` deletes every unreadable key from each returned row
  and objectql's expand path writes the resolved record back under that same
  key, so one statement removes the expanded object and the bare id alike; the
  expansion sub-read is itself gated (the referenced object's full CRUD + RLS +
  FLS treatment, objectstack#7626). It is load-bearing for any backend that does
  not strip, and the client-request side is real regardless.
  
  **Nothing a permitted view did stops working.** The gate judges each site's
  `buildExpandFields` OUTPUT, which contains only the object's declared
  reference-bearing fields, so the "`checkField` answers false for an
  undeclared key" trap cannot be reached. An unanswered permission policy
  filters nothing. `buildExpandFields` itself is unchanged.
  
  `@object-ui/permissions` is added to `dependencies` for `plugin-kanban`,
  `plugin-tree`, `plugin-map`, `plugin-timeline`, and `plugin-view` — the fifth
  one objectui#7429's own dependency count missed (it named four); `plugin-list`
  and `app-shell` already had it.
- c6198c2: **Breaking for authored metadata:** `ComponentInput.label`, `ComponentInput.defaultValue` and
  `ComponentInput.advanced` are RETIRED on both faces (objectui#7493 item ① and objectui#7781;
  maintainer ruling A of 2026-09-06, immediate, no deprecation window; ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).
  They are the three keys the manifest serializer does not forward, and nothing read them on any
  publication or consumption path.
  
  No manifest ever published them, so no consumer could ever have read them. `sdui-parser`'s
  serializer (`packages/sdui-parser/src/index.ts`) forwards exactly six keys per input — `name`,
  `type`, `required`, `enum`, `binding`, `description` — so a value authored under any of the three
  never reached `sdui.manifest.json`, the generated JSX `.d.ts`, or a diagnostic; its boundary type
  has no slot for them; the registry's data-source seam reads `name` only; and neither the designer
  nor the app-shell inspectors consult registry `inputs` at all. A structural census over every
  `inputs:` array in the repository (re-measured on this change's merge-base, `name` 951 and `type`
  951 as the controls) counted the writes: `label` 908, `defaultValue` 245, `advanced` 9 — written on
  nearly every registration, read by nothing.
  
  FROM → TO, per key — all three **TOMBSTONED, not removed**, because the route was measured on
  the built face before it was chosen: `ComponentInputSchema` is a non-strict `z.object`, and an
  undeclared key parses GREEN and is silently STRIPPED, so a deletion would have swallowed 1,162
  authored values in silence. The tombstone is what makes the refusal loud and by name.
  
  - `label?: string` → `label?: never` on the interface, `retirementTombstone()` on the Zod mirror.
    Migration: delete the key. An input is identified by its `name` on every path that reaches it;
    nothing ever rendered a label for it.
  - `defaultValue?: any` → `defaultValue?: never` / `retirementTombstone()`. Migration: delete the
    key. The renderer's own fallback read IS the default; tell the author about it in `description`,
    which IS published. (Tightening the type to `unknown` was ruled out: it closes no error class,
    since nothing reads the value.)
  - `advanced?: boolean` → `advanced?: never` / `retirementTombstone()`. Migration: delete the key.
    No designer surface ever hid an "advanced" input; there is nothing to write instead.
  
  The retirement kit: `?: never` on `ComponentInput` (`packages/types/src/base.ts`), so authoring one
  is a `tsc` error at the registration site; `retirementTombstone()` on `ComponentInputSchema`
  (`packages/types/src/zod/base.zod.ts`), so an authored value is REFUSED at parse time with
  `code: 'invalid_type'`, the key named in the issue `path`, and the migration note as the message
  (one string, both channels). Pinned in
  `packages/types/src/__tests__/component-input-retired-keys-7493.test.ts`, which also holds a
  tree-scoped absence census over every `inputs:` array under `packages/**` and `apps/**`.
  
  Accept-set change, stated plainly for reviewers: a document that sets any of the three keys on a
  `ComponentInput` used to parse GREEN (the value was then dropped by the serializer) and now parses
  RED. Every in-repo authoring site — 1,199 keys across 110 registration files, the three standalone
  `ComponentInput[]` arrays and the two named input arrays `tsc` found included — is deleted in the same change, as the ruling's split rule
  requires; the `WidgetRegistry` seam no longer copies the widget-manifest values onto the synthesized
  `ComponentInput` (they fed nothing), and the data-source declaration `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT`
  drops its `label`. The patch entries on the other packages record exactly that: their registrations
  stop authoring inert keys, with no runtime or published-manifest change.
  
  The nine test files that read `defaultValue` off a registration were re-pinned against the
  renderer's ACTUAL default (its own fallback read, or the `defaultProps` it ships) instead of the
  declaration that went away; two assertions that only restated the shadow default were dropped with
  the reason on the line.
  
  The in-repo zero is what was measured. Whether anything OUTSIDE this repository writes these keys
  is not measurable from here (the objectui#5674 limit); converting such a write from a silent drop
  into a named refusal is exactly what the tombstones buy. `WidgetInput`'s own `label` /
  `defaultValue` / `advanced` (the widget-manifest face) stay declared and writable — nothing has
  ruled on that face; that it now has no reader either is recorded as objectui#7911.
- ce2aaef: One shared record-source ladder, five plugins delegate (objectui#7632).
  
  `@object-ui/core` publishes `resolveRecordSourceConfig(schema)` — the ONE implementation
  of the ruled three-rung record source ladder: `data` first, then `staticData` wrapped as
  `{ provider: 'value', items }`, then `objectName` folded to `{ provider: 'object' }`, and
  `null` when nothing is bound. It is the PRODUCER whose output the objectui#7627 reader
  `resolveRecordSourceObjectName` consumes, and it now sits beside it in the same module.
  
  That ladder is published contract on both faces — `packages/types/src/objectql.ts` and its
  zod mirror both ship `.describe()` strings naming `getDataConfig`'s order (objectui#6939,
  maintainer ruling 2026-09-02), pinned by `objectql-record-source-refinement-6939.test.ts` —
  and it was hand-copied into five plugin components with no gate holding them together. A
  change to the ruled order had five edit sites and nothing that noticed a missed one; that
  is the AGENTS.md #0.1 drift class.
  
  **No behaviour changes.** `ObjectCalendar`, `ObjectGantt` and `ObjectTree` now call the
  shared reader directly. `ObjectGrid` and `ObjectMap` keep their own bare-array `data`
  shorthand as a documented head above the shared call and are otherwise unchanged.
  `record-source-config.behaviourNeutrality-7632.test.ts` transcribes all five pre-collapse
  bodies verbatim and asserts the post-collapse spelling agrees with each across the whole
  input matrix, so a later edit to the shared reader that moves any site turns red.
  
  **Two divergences were measured rather than assumed, and both are preserved.**
  
  `ObjectCalendar`'s `'data' in schema && schema.data` guards exist because its parameter is
  the union `ObjectGridSchema | CalendarSchema` and `CalendarSchema` declares neither key.
  That is a TypeScript narrowing device with no runtime effect — an absent property reads
  `undefined`, falsy either way — so the guard could never change which rung is taken. The
  shared reader's optional-property parameter accepts the union directly, and the
  equivalence is pinned on a fixture that really lacks both keys rather than argued.
  
  `ObjectGrid` and `ObjectMap` normalize a bare-array `data` to `{ provider: 'value', items }`;
  `ObjectCalendar`, `ObjectGantt` and `ObjectTree` do not, and return the array verbatim. That
  is a real divergence on off-contract input — `ViewData` is a discriminated union over object
  variants, so an array under `data` cannot be published. It is NOT unified here: the shared
  rung stays contract-strict and the two sites keep the head locally, the same way objectui#7627
  left the off-contract `{ provider: 'object' }` tails at their sites. Both sides of the fork are
  pinned, so neither folding the head in nor deleting it as redundant can happen silently.
  
  `ObjectTree`'s copy took `schema: any`; it now goes through the shared reader's typed
  parameter. Types are erased at runtime, so nothing it resolves moves.
- ff7543c: `ObjectMapProps.clusterRadius`'s JSDoc said "in pixels"; `clusterMarkers` has
  always used it as a coordinate-degree grid cell edge (`radius / 2 ** zoom`,
  divided into the marker's `[lng, lat]` degrees), not a screen-space radius —
  a host tuning clustering granularity by the documented unit would get a
  completely different result than intended (objectui#5020).
  
  No behavior, default, or name changes: clustering, the >100-visible-marker
  auto-threshold, and tap-through zoom are unaffected, and `clusterRadius` has
  no call sites outside `plugin-map/src` today (re-confirmed repo-wide,
  including `apps/`, `examples/`, and the `objectstack` spec/server repo — the
  default of `50` is what runs everywhere). This is a doc-comment correction
  only, bringing the JSDoc in line with the README's already-correct wording
  (post objectui#5002).
  
  The latitude-anisotropy trade-off (a degree grid distorts east-west as
  latitude rises) is a known design trade-off, not part of this fix.
- 2aac61f: `ObjectMap` now resolves marker titles through `@object-ui/core`'s
  `getRecordDisplayName` (ADR-0079), instead of reading a hard-coded `'name'` key.
  
  `getMapConfig` used to fill an absent title binding with the string literal
  `'name'`, and the marker transform then did a bare `record[titleField]` read. For
  every object whose display field is not literally `name`, that read was
  `undefined`, so each marker popup titled itself `undefined`. The literal is gone
  from both branches that carried it, and the read site hands the decision to the
  same resolver `ObjectKanban`, `ObjectCalendar` and `ObjectGantt` already title
  their items through — `ObjectMap` was the fourth renderer and the only one still
  outside it.
  
  An authored `map.titleField` keeps winning outright: it is passed through as the
  resolver's explicit `titleField` option, which it checks first. What is new
  underneath is everything a static field-name binding cannot express — the
  object's declared `nameField`, its deprecated `displayNameField` alias, a legacy
  `titleFormat` template, type-aware field derivation, and a name-ish probe over
  the record's own keys for the inline-data case where no object definition is
  fetched at all.
  
  Records with no resolvable name now read `Record #<id>` rather than `undefined`
  or a uniform `Marker`; the `Marker` placeholder is kept only for a record that
  carries no id either. No authoring surface changes and no new map config keys.
- b180a64: `ObjectMap` reads `schema.data` in one place again, so an array-shorthand map stops
  making a metadata request it never uses.
  
  The fetch effect carried a second short-circuit beside the `props.data` one
  objectui#5003 fixed: it read `schema.data` directly and tested whether that value was
  itself an array. eslint reported it as `missing dependency: schema.data` — the last
  `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warning on that effect.
  
  The dependency was never actually missing. `getDataConfig(schema)` already returns
  `schema.data` verbatim, and the result is memoized on `JSON.stringify(rawDataConfig)`
  into `dataConfig`, which **is** one of the effect's declared dependencies. The authored
  rows therefore reached the effect before this change; the direct read was a duplicate of
  an already-threaded value, which is why neither adding a dependency nor deleting the
  branch was right.
  
  The array handling moved into `getDataConfig`, where `ObjectGrid`'s own `getDataConfig`
  already pins the same normalization (`"Check if data is an array (shorthand format)"`).
  Same rows render, and the effect now reads only `dataConfig`.
  
  One behavioural consequence, and it is the point: an array under `data` now yields
  `provider: 'value'`, so `hasInlineData` is true and the sibling effect no longer calls
  `dataSource.getObjectSchema()` for it. That request's only read site is
  `buildExpandFields()` inside the object-provider fetch branch, which an inline schema
  never reaches — so the call was pure waste, and the shorthand now behaves exactly like
  the declared `{ provider: 'value', items }` form it is shorthand for.
  
  Deleting the branch instead was measured, not assumed: with no producer-side handling,
  an array-shorthand map renders `Error: DataSource required for object/api providers`
  rather than its markers. The shorthand is a live convention in six sibling blocks
  (`ObjectGrid`, `ListView`, `ObjectTree`, `ObjectChart`, `ObjectDataTable`,
  `calendar-view-renderer`), so `object-map` would have become the one block in the family
  that answers it with an error box.
- 538ed92: `ObjectMap`: make the marker `useMemo` actually memoize.
  
  `getMapConfig(schema)` ran unmemoized in the render body, so `mapConfig` carried
  a fresh object identity on every render. The marker transform names `mapConfig`
  in its dependency array, so it recomputed on every single render — walking every
  record through `extractCoordinates` and the display-name resolver, and re-running
  `ObjectMapConfigSchema.safeParse` on each pass — while declaring that it does not.
  The invalidation cascaded on into `filteredMarkers`, `clusteredData`,
  `markerBounds` and `initialViewState`.
  
  `mapConfig` is now memoized on `schema`, the one value `getMapConfig` reads.
  Behaviour is unchanged; the config is still rebuilt whenever the schema
  genuinely changes.
- cfcff30: Each package's README now states, up front, that it needs a bundler: importing it from plain Node ESM fails, and that is a supported-configuration boundary rather than a defect.
  
  `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` imports `react-grid-layout/css/styles.css` at module
  scope and `@object-ui/plugin-map` imports `maplibre-gl/dist/maplibre-gl.css`;
  `@object-ui/app-shell` reaches the first of those through the static
  `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` imports in `DashboardView` and `ReportView`. Node has
  no loader for `.css` at all, so all three resolve and then die during evaluation:
  
  ```
  TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION]: Unknown file extension ".css"
    for .../react-grid-layout/css/styles.css
  ```
  
  Nothing about how these packages load has changed — every supported host bundles
  them (Vite, webpack, or Next with the package in `transpilePackages`), and that is
  still the only supported way to consume them. What changed is that the boundary is
  now written where a consumer meets it, instead of being learned from a red import.
  
  objectui#5384 ruled unbundled Node consumption **unsupported** for style-carrying
  plugin packages — permanently, over the three packages as a group — rather than
  moving the stylesheet imports out of module scope. No unbundled-Node consumer
  exists, and buying permanent machinery to close a capability gap nobody is pulling
  on was the trade the ruling declined. A real consumer request reopens it as a
  design question, not as a defect: the READMEs say so and name the issue.
- 2aa2c22: `ObjectMap` no longer serializes its data config on every render.
  
  `getDataConfig(schema)` was called bare in the render body and its result
  re-serialized with `JSON.stringify` on every render, purely to give `dataConfig`
  the stable identity its fetch effect depends on. `getDataConfig` is a pure
  function of `schema`, so `useMemo(() => getDataConfig(schema), [schema])` gives
  the same identity with no serialize and no per-render rebuild.
  
  This also fixes a crash. `JSON.stringify` throws on a value it cannot serialize,
  and the config's passthrough branch returns the author's own `schema.data`
  object verbatim — inline rows included. A map handed inline records carrying a
  back-reference (an `$expand`-ed lookup) or a `BigInt` id threw from the render
  body and took the whole map subtree down with it. Comparing identities never
  serializes, so the config no longer has to be serializable at all.

## 17.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 0a73b51: `ObjectView` and `ListView` now flatten a view's `map` block through a
  whitelist instead of spreading the whole (untyped) block to the top level.
  
  Both `case 'map'` flatteners used to build the `object-map` schema with
  `...(options.map || {})` — a raw spread of an untyped bag
  (`NamedListView.options?: Record<string, any>`), so any key an author wrote in
  the `map` block reached the top level unfiltered. `ObjectMap`'s own
  `FlatMapConfigKeys = Omit<ObjectMapConfig, 'style'>` declares `style` OUT of
  this flat form (`style` is also `BaseSchema.style`, inline CSS legal on every
  node), so the two disagreed about the same shape. `style` was the live
  specimen: `map: { style: '<url>' }` reached the top level as a CSS-shaped
  `style` key it was never supposed to carry.
  
  Behavior narrowing, stated because it changes what reaches the flattened
  schema: a `map` block key that is not one of `ObjectMapConfig`'s declared
  flat keys (`latitudeField` / `longitudeField` / `locationField` / `titleField`
  / `descriptionField` / `zoom` / `center`) — including `style` — no longer
  reaches the top level of the flattened `object-map` schema. This closes a gap
  rather than removing working behavior: the pinned strict spec view schemas
  accept no `map` block at all today, so no author-facing surface could reach
  this path, and `ObjectMap` already stopped reading a top-level `style` as a
  map style (a dev warning names the correct spelling instead).
  
  The whitelist is DERIVED from `ObjectMapConfigSchema` (`@object-ui/types/zod`)
  rather than hand-listed, so the flatteners and the declaration cannot drift
  apart again — a key added to (or removed from) the schema reaches both
  flatteners without a second edit. `ObjectMap`'s own `FLAT_MAP_CONFIG_KEYS` is
  derived from the same schema for the same reason.
- 578e025: `ObjectMapSchema` declares what ObjectMap reads, and the `map` block outranks the flat spelling
  
  `object-map` carried three disagreeing shapes for one component. The declared face
  (`ObjectMapSchema`) had four keys — `type`, `objectName`, `locationField`,
  `titleField`, `mapStyle`. The renderer read about fifteen. And `ObjectMapProps.schema`
  was typed `ObjectGridSchema`, so every map-specific read went through
  `(schema as any)`. A TypeScript author could not write the `map` block the docs teach,
  and misspelling `latitudeField` as `latitudeFieId` was caught by nothing: the map
  rendered empty and looked like bad data.
  
  Declared now, each with a read site in `ObjectMap.tsx`: `data`, `staticData`, `filter`,
  `sort`, `map`, `enableClustering`, `navigation`. `ObjectMapConfig` (interface) and
  `ObjectMapConfigSchema` (zod) are lifted out of `plugin-map`, where the zod was
  package-private and called `MapConfigSchema`, into `@object-ui/types` and
  `@object-ui/types/zod` — so the declared authoring face and the validation the renderer
  performs are one schema rather than two that can drift. The `Object` prefix is not
  decoration: `@objectstack/spec/automation` already exports `MapConfigSchema` for an
  unrelated concept, and a local declaration under a spec export's name is what
  `check:spec-symbols` exists to refuse. `ObjectMapProps.schema` is `ObjectMapSchema`, and the `as any` map reads
  are gone.
  
  Behavior change, ruled by the maintainer on objectui#5018 (2026-08-17): the `map` block
  is the author face and the flat top-level spelling (`schema.latitudeField`, …) is the
  internal form ObjectView / ListView produce when they flatten `options.map`. When a
  schema carries both, **the `map` block now wins** — the reverse of the previous order,
  under which the flatten product silently shadowed an authored block — and a dev-mode
  warning names the top-level keys that were ignored. The flat spelling stays out of the
  declared surface and out of the docs.
  
  Nothing changes for views built by ObjectView / ListView: both flatteners emit the flat
  keys and no `map` key at all, so the branch the flip reorders is never reached for their
  output. That property is now pinned rather than assumed
  (`plugin-view/src/__tests__/ObjectView.mapFlatten.test.tsx`).
  
  Bound worth stating, because it limits what the typed surface can promise: `BaseSchema`
  carries an index signature (`[key: string]: any`), so a misspelled key at the TOP level
  still type-checks — for every component schema in the repo. The `map` BLOCK is closed,
  which is what makes the card's headline typo a compile error.

### Patch Changes

- 5edc0c5: `object-gantt` / `object-map` / `object-calendar` no longer drop a sort entry that omits `order`.
  
  The three blocks each inlined a byte-identical private copy of the `sort` →
  `$orderby` conversion. That copy required BOTH `field` and `order` on an array
  entry and silently skipped any entry missing one, so a stored view sorting by
  `[{ field: 'amount' }]` reached the wire with no ordering at all — the authored
  sort key was lost, not applied. The same copy already treated the STRING
  spelling `"amount"` as ascending, so this was an inconsistency between two
  spellings of one thing rather than deliberate strictness.
  
  All three now import the shared `convertSortToQueryParams` sink from
  `@object-ui/core` (introduced by objectstack#7137, already used by
  `object-timeline` and `record:line_items`), and the private copies are gone —
  the sink is the repo's only definition. Two behavior changes come with it, both
  of which make the blocks more faithful to what is already declared rather than
  more tolerant:
  
  - An array entry that omits `order` now orders ASCENDING instead of vanishing.
    That is what `QueryParams.$orderby`'s own member shape
    (`{ field: string; order?: 'asc' | 'desc' }`) says, and what
    `@object-ui/data-objectstack`'s `serializeOrderBy` already did with a missing
    direction.
  - When nothing orderable was authored, the query now carries no `$orderby` at
    all instead of an empty object. `{}` is truthy and meant "no ordering" only by
    accident of the adapter's serializer.
  
  Reachability, so the size of this is not overstated: `SortConfig.order` and
  `ElementDataSourceSort.order` are REQUIRED in objectui's own types, so a typed
  caller could never author the dropped shape. The affected surface is untyped
  stored view metadata (`ElementSavedView` is a loose record by design) — which is
  exactly where an order-less entry can arrive today.
- 25819c4: A map view now fits its camera to the records it queried, so a view with data never first-paints an empty viewport.
  
  The initial camera was never derived from the data. The zoom came from
  `getMapConfig`'s default branch — the branch reached precisely when the author
  declared nothing — which synthesized `zoom: 10` at the origin, and the fabricated
  value was indistinguishable from a declared one at the read site. An unconfigured
  object list view of continent-wide records therefore opened on a ~30km-wide
  viewport centred on the set's midpoint: no markers anywhere on screen, the
  records reachable only by zooming out and panning by hand (objectui#4941, seen on
  the showcase `task` map view, whose ten seeded US-city locations span ~4000km).
  
  The camera is now the marker set's bounding box, handed to MapLibre as
  `initialViewState.bounds` so the fit happens against the real container size,
  with padding and a city-scale zoom ceiling (a single record, or several at one
  address, fits a zero-width box — unbounded, that answers with a rooftop view of a
  style whose tiles stop far short of it).
  
  The box is measured along the **shortest arc** containing every marker, not
  between the naive longitude extremes. Read as a line rather than a circle, two
  records two degrees apart across the antimeridian (179 and -179) describe a
  358-degree box whose centre is their antipode; MapLibre then places the markers in
  whichever copy of the world is nearest their previous screen position, which is
  how a fitted-looking camera ends up showing empty ocean with the records sitting
  on a neighbouring copy.
  
  Unchanged on purpose: record coordinates are not rescued. The platform's
  `location` value bounds longitude to [-180, 180], so an out-of-range coordinate is
  a producer-side defect — such records keep being rejected and counted in the
  view's "invalid coordinates" notice, and the normalization above is camera
  arithmetic over already-valid values. No new configuration key was added either:
  the documented `zoom` / `center` pair of the `map` block is still the only camera
  declaration, it still wins outright, and declaring one half keeps the other
  derived (`zoom` alone applies at the records' centre; `center` alone at a
  continental zoom). An empty result set is not fitted — it opens on the whole
  world rather than a zoom-10 patch of sea.
- 072085d: A map node's top-level `style` is inline CSS again, not a MapLibre style URL.
  
  `ObjectMap.getMapConfig` resolved the map style from three spellings with the
  top-level `style` FIRST — `schema.style || schema.mapStyle || schema.map?.style`
  — but `style` is `BaseSchema.style`, a record of inline CSS properties that
  every schema node may legally carry. Writing the base face's own
  `style: { height: '400px' }` on a map node therefore handed that object to
  MapGL's `mapStyle` prop: it never passed the config `safeParse` (which only ever
  looked at `schema.map`), so there was no validation and no diagnostic either.
  
  `@object-ui/types` had already named the map's key `mapStyle` — explicitly "not
  `style`, to avoid colliding with `BaseSchema.style`" — so the consumer was
  reading, at top priority, the very name the declaration went out of its way to
  avoid. The declaration is now what is enforced: the map style comes from
  `mapStyle` on the schema or `style` inside the declared `map` block, and a
  top-level `style` is not consumed as a map style in any shape.
  
  Behaviour change, stated because it is one: a map configured through a top-level
  `style` URL now renders with the default public demo tiles. That spelling was
  never documented (the README teaches `map.style`) and no metadata in this repo
  used it, but it was runtime-reachable one way — `ObjectView` / `ListView`
  flatten `options.map`'s CONTENTS to the top level, so a view authored with
  `map: { style: '<url>' }` arrived here as a top-level string. That shape is not
  spec-authorable (`@objectstack/spec`'s list-view schemas are strict and declare
  no `map` block at all, so such a view fails validation outright), and it now
  gets a dev warning naming both surviving spellings rather than silently painting
  the demo tiles. The object form gets no warning: legal base-face authoring, and
  dropping it is the fix.
- 687bc0c: Fix two pieces of `ObjectMap` state that stopped tracking their source after mount
  (objectui#5003):
  
  - **`data` prop threading**: the fetch effect preferred records passed via `props.data`,
    but `data` was read off the `rest` spread and was not one of the effect's dependencies.
    A host rendering `<ObjectMap data={[]} .../>` while its own query is in flight, then
    re-rendering with the resolved rows, kept showing the empty map — the prop changed, the
    effect never re-ran to notice. `data` is now a declared prop (`data: dataProp`), tracked
    directly in the effect's dependency array; the whole `rest` object is intentionally
    **not** added there (it is a fresh object every render, which would refetch on every
    render instead).
  - **Clustering zoom seed**: `currentZoom` — what `clusterMarkers` uses for its grid cell
    size — was seeded with a nominal `mapConfig.zoom || 3` and updated only by `onZoom`.
    MapLibre applies the initial camera (including a `bounds` fit) via its constructor,
    before react-map-gl attaches React's event handlers, so no `onZoom` ever fired for that
    first camera — the seed stayed nominal until the user's first zoom. It is now also
    seeded from `onLoad`, which fires once the initial camera has settled, so clustering at
    first paint reflects the camera MapLibre actually applied.
  
  Both were dormant on the console path (never exercised in the example apps) — see the
  issue for why — so this ships with dedicated tests exercising the prop-update path and
  the pre-`onZoom` clustering state directly.
- 084155e: Fix the two remaining `object/api/value` claims that objectui#5019 (PR #5162) left
  behind — its dispatch was scoped to only the "API Provider" section of
  `content/docs/plugins/plugin-map.mdx`, so the same false claim survived in the Features
  list and in the `ObjectMap.tsx` file-header JSDoc:
  
  - `content/docs/plugins/plugin-map.mdx:24` (Features list): "Works seamlessly with
    object/api/value data providers" → "Works seamlessly with object/value data providers".
  - `packages/plugin-map/src/ObjectMap.tsx:20` (file-header JSDoc): "Works with
    object/api/value data providers" → "Works with object/value data providers".
  
  `provider: 'api'` still hits `console.warn('API provider not yet implemented for
  ObjectMap')` and returns an empty record set (`ObjectMap.tsx:584`); `endpoint`/`method`
  have no read point in the package. Implementing the `api` provider is capability
  expansion and is explicitly out of scope here, same as it was for #5019.
  
  No runtime behaviour changes — a source comment and a docs line only.

## 17.5.0

### Patch Changes

- d0c3b26: Every plain `<button>` now declares its `type`. HTML defaults an untyped button to
  `type="submit"`, so any of these buttons would submit the form it was composed into
  instead of running its own handler — a real risk for renderers (`drawer`, `tree-view`,
  `navigation-overlay`) whose placement inside a form is a JSON metadata decision. 114
  sites were converted to `type="button"`; no site was a genuine submit button, and the
  DOM is otherwise unchanged.

  The defect class is now closed mechanically by a new `object-ui/button-has-type` ESLint
  rule (error), so the next untyped button fails CI at write time rather than being found
  by a fourth audit round (objectui#4045, closing the objectui#3344 family).

- b388d0e: `object-map` reads its configuration from the declared `map` input only — `filter` is the query filter, and a map authored with both stopped rendering markers

  `getMapConfig` probed every filter for a `map` key and, on a hit, used it as the MapConfig: `schema.filter.map`, plus a `schema.filter.map.style` half in the style chain. That shape predates the `{ name: 'map', type: 'object' }` input both registrations declare, and it gave `filter` two meanings inside one block — the query filter at `$filter: schema.filter`, and a configuration slot.

  The probe was written as `'map' in schema.filter`, and `in` walks the prototype chain. The ordinary filter is an **array**, and every array inherits `Array.prototype.map` — so the probe matched, handed the component a _function_ as its map configuration, and the spread of a function is `{}`. The declared `schema.map` was never reached (it sat in the `else` branch), so a map authored with both `map` and `filter` — two documented inputs, no legacy shape required — lost `latitudeField` / `longitudeField` / `titleField`, failed `extractCoordinates` on every record, and rendered zero markers under a "N records with missing or invalid coordinates excluded from the map" banner. The only console output was `[ObjectMap] Invalid map configuration:` from the Zod parse of a function.

  This was reachable two ways and both are fixed by the same deletion: an author writing `filter` alongside `map`, and the `dataSource` binding of objectstack#7121, whose merged filter is an `and` node — `['and', [...], [...]]`, still an array, still carrying `Array.prototype.map`.

  Both legacy reads are gone; the map consumes only what it declares. The `map` config, the top-level `locationField` / `latitudeField` branch, and the `style` / `mapStyle` reads are untouched, and `filter` is passed to the query verbatim — a field genuinely named `map` still filters on it, and nothing is stripped from the author's filter.

  A schema still carrying the legacy `filter.map` stash now gets a dev-mode warning naming the shape and pointing at `schema.map`, rather than silently falling back to the default field names. It is deliberately narrow: own properties only (so an inherited `map` method never triggers it) and object-valued only (so `filter: { map: 'x' }` reads as a filter on a field named `map`), and it warns once per distinct stash because `getMapConfig` runs on every render. Production behavior is unchanged beyond the configuration no longer being read.

## 17.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 022002a: `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` now reaches the remaining object-bound public
  blocks: `object-gantt` / `object-timeline` / `object-map` / `object-pivot` /
  `object-master-detail-form` / `embeddable-form` / `record:line_items`
  (objectstack#7121).

  objectstack#6953 wired the spec's per-element data binding
  (`dataSource: { object, view?, filter?, sort?, limit? }`) to the eight blocks it
  named and left the same declaration inert on these seven. Each gates its fetch on
  its own object key and nothing mapped `dataSource.object` onto it, so a page
  written the way the spec documents rendered an empty gantt / an empty timeline
  rail / a map with no markers / an empty cross-tab / a field-less form — with no
  request and no diagnostic anywhere. Spec-valid metadata rendering nothing is the
  objectstack#4413 shape.

  Composition follows objectstack#5576's landed semantics unchanged, through the
  shared `ElementDataSourceGate` (no change to it or to the resolution layer): a
  named saved view supplies the baseline, a key written on the component itself
  overrides it, an explicit binding key overrides both, `filter` AND-combines
  ("additional filter criteria" — a binding can narrow a view, never widen it), and
  a `view` name that does not resolve renders a configuration error on every one of
  these blocks instead of degrading to the object's full scope.

  Each block maps **only** the keys it genuinely reads, which for this batch means
  several keys stay deliberately unmapped rather than being parked somewhere
  plausible:

  - `object-gantt` and `object-map` take `object` / `filter` / `sort`; neither has a
    row cap or a field-list read site.
  - `object-pivot` takes `object` / `filter`; a cross-tab orders itself by its own
    row/column grouping and cannot be computed over a truncated page.
  - `object-timeline` takes `object` only — its fetch is
    `find(objectName, { options: { $top: 100 } })`, with no filter/sort read site
    at all, so a named view is error-checked and then contributes nothing.
  - `embeddable-form` and `object-master-detail-form` take `object` only (the
    parent object, in the master-detail case); a form that writes one record has no
    collection query for `filter` / `sort` / `limit` to narrow.
  - `record:line_items` takes `object` onto **`childObject`** — the collection it
    actually lists — and nothing else: its query is the parent FK plus a fixed
    `$top: 500`, and its `columns` are editable `GridColumn` objects rather than a
    field-name projection a view could supply.

  The per-block coverage table, including every residual gap named above, is in
  `content/docs/guide/data-source.md`.

  No behaviour change for a block that carries no `dataSource`: the binding-free
  path returns the schema by reference, so nothing remounts and nothing refetches.

- 9ad21b6: `plugin-map` 加载时不再向控制台打印 `Registering object-map...`

  `packages/plugin-map/src/index.tsx` 的注册调用之前留着一句调试输出
  `console.log('Registering object-map...')`。它位于**模块作用域**,所以不是「渲染地图时打一行」,
  而是**只要这个 plugin 被 import 就打一行**:console 应用的 `register-plugins` 一加载即触发,
  单元测试里跟着刷,生产 bundle 同样保留 —— 使用者控制台里凭空多出一行来源不明的噪音。

  同仓其余 18 个 plugin 的 `src/index.tsx` 注册处都没有这类输出,这一句是孤例
  (`plugin-editor` 里唯一的 `console.log` 命中是 `defaultProps.value` 示例代码字符串,
  不是会执行的语句)。纯噪音,不涉及任何行为:注册本身、`ObjectMap` 的渲染与取数都不读它。

  顺带记一条搜索时确认的背景:仓库的 eslint 配置没有开 `no-console` 规则,所以这类遗留
  调试输出没有任何自动化拦网 —— 这次是靠人工发现的。是否全仓开 `no-console`(以及
  `ObjectMap.tsx` 里三处**有意**保留的 `console.warn`/`console.error` 诊断如何豁免)是一个
  影响多个包的策略决定,已另行开单,不混进本 PR。

  回潮钉在 `src/index.registration.test.tsx`:spy 掉 `console.log`/`info`/`debug` 后
  `vi.resetModules()` 再 `import('./index')`,断言零输出。钉子刻意只覆盖这三个「噪音通道」,
  不含 `warn`/`error` —— `ComponentRegistry.register()` 在缺 namespace、以及裸名 fallback
  覆盖冲突时**按设计**会 `console.warn`(`packages/core/src/registry/Registry.ts`),
  一刀切断言「零 console 输出」等于把 Registry 的诊断契约钉在这里,将来会因与「遗留调试输出」
  无关的原因变红。钉子里还有一条非空断言:import 后校验 `object-map`/`map` 两个注册确实进了
  registry,免得模块缓存导致 import 未真正执行、于是「没有输出」是因为**什么都没发生**而假绿。

## 17.0.0

### Patch Changes

- 5b9cf96: fix(plugin-map): drop the `maplibre-gl@6` default import, and put type-check behind a CI gate that cannot be silently skipped (#2911)

  `maplibre-gl@6.0.0` removed its default export (arrived via #2848, dependabot),
  so `ObjectMap.tsx`'s `import maplibregl from 'maplibre-gl'` has been a TS1192
  error on `main` for a day. The binding was never used — the map instance comes
  from `react-map-gl/maplibre`, and the stylesheet from the side-effect import on
  the next line — so the import is simply deleted rather than rewritten to
  `import * as`.

  Removing it is runtime-neutral, which the issue had explicitly left unverified.
  `@vis.gl/react-maplibre` (what `react-map-gl/maplibre` re-exports) does
  `Promise.resolve(mapLib || import('maplibre-gl'))` in `components/map.js`, so it
  loads the library itself when no `mapLib` prop is passed. Verified in a browser
  against the `store-locator-map` catalog schema: `maplibre-gl` is fetched as its
  own lazy chunk, the WebGL canvas comes up 800x600, and all three markers mount —
  byte-identical probe output with and without the static import. That also matches
  what `apps/console/src/main.tsx` already intends, where the plugin is registered
  lazily specifically to keep `maplibre-gl` out of the initial bundle.

  **The reason it survived a day of green CI is the part worth fixing.** No
  workflow ran `type-check` at all, and `turbo build` only checks types for
  packages whose `build` script happens to invoke `tsc` — the 22 `vite build`
  packages transpile without checking. A sweep of all 45 packages found ten with
  broken types, `plugin-map` merely being the one that had a script to notice it.

  Adding a `pnpm type-check` job alone would not have been a gate: **turbo silently
  skips any package with no `type-check` script**, so 17 packages read as passing
  because nothing ran. With `plugin-map` fixed, `pnpm type-check` reports 63/63
  green while nine packages are still broken. So:

  - `plugin-ai` and `plugin-report` gain the `paths` override their type-checked
    peers already carry, which detaches workspace deps from sibling _source_ and
    resolves them through built `.d.ts` — the sole cause of the 104-error TS6059
    `rootDir` floods, and the same trick their own `vite.config.ts` already applies
    to the dts program.
  - Seven packages gain `"type-check": "tsc --noEmit"` (`plugin-ai`,
    `plugin-report`, `plugin-dashboard`, `create-plugin`, `console`, and the two
    console examples). Coverage goes 28 -> 35 of 45.
  - New `scripts/check-type-check-coverage.mjs` makes the invisibility impossible:
    a package with no `type-check` script must be declared, with a reason, and the
    lists only shrink — gaining a script without deleting the entry fails the
    guard. The nine known-broken packages are recorded there with error counts
    (`@object-ui/runner` has no `tsconfig.json` at all), tracked as follow-ups.
  - New `Type Check` CI job runs the coverage guard first (instant, no install),
    then `pnpm type-check`.

  Both halves were proven to fail before being trusted: the guard was exercised in
  all four of its failure modes, and re-introducing the `maplibre-gl` import turns
  the job red again, as does a fresh error injected into `plugin-ai` — a package
  that had no type checking whatsoever before this change.

## 16.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 7cf4051: chore(deps): align every `@objectstack/*` dependency to `^16.0.0-rc.0`

  Bumps `@objectstack/spec` / `client` / `formula` / `lint` from `^15.1.1` to the
  `16.0.0-rc.0` pre-release across the workspace (root + `apps/console` +
  `apps/site` + all consuming packages). ObjectUI's own packages are already on
  major 16, so this closes the 15↔16 skew between ObjectUI and the `@objectstack`
  contract libraries (which publish in lockstep with `spec`).

  This is a dependency alignment, not a behavioral migration: the full workspace
  build (43/43) and the `@objectstack`-consuming package test suites
  (`core` / `app-shell` / `data-objectstack` / `plugin-form` / `types`) are green
  against `16.0.0-rc.0` with no source changes required.

  Practical effect: `@objectstack/client@16.0.0-rc.0` now ships
  `data.batchTransaction` (framework #3271), so `ObjectStackAdapter`'s feature
  detect (`typeof client.data.batchTransaction === 'function'`) routes
  master-detail cross-object saves through the typed SDK method instead of the
  raw `fetch('/api/v1/batch')` fallback — realizing the "verify SDK path" half of
  #2694. The raw-fetch branch stays as a defensive fallback (removal tracked in
  #2694).

- 549c67d: chore(lint): clear the mechanical baseline lint errors so these packages' lint gates protect them again

  Extends the fields/core cleanup from #2709 (objectui#2713). These eight package
  lints were red at baseline on `main`, so their per-package `lint` gate could not
  catch new violations of the same class. Cleared every **error** (no behavior
  change; warnings are out of scope):

  - **`no-useless-catch`** (`data-objectstack`) — unwrapped five try/catch blocks
    whose `catch` only re-threw; errors still propagate identically.
  - **`preserve-caught-error`** (`cli`, `data-objectstack`, `react`) — the caught
    error's message is inlined into the thrown `Error`; a scoped disable with a
    justifying comment carries each one, because these packages target ES2020
    whose lib types the 1-arg `Error` constructor only (so `{ cause }` won't
    compile) — same reasoning as the core case in #2709.
  - **`prefer-const`** (`plugin-calendar`, `plugin-map`) — `let`→`const` for
    never-reassigned bindings.
  - **`no-empty-object-type`** (`plugin-designer`) — empty extend-only interfaces
    → equivalent `type` aliases.
  - **`no-useless-assignment`** (`react`) — dropped a dead initializer that both
    branches overwrite before it is read.
  - **`no-require-imports`** (`plugin-calendar`, `plugin-timeline` tests) —
    hoisted `vi.mock` factories now use an `async` factory with
    `await import('react')` instead of `require('react')`.
  - **stale `eslint-disable` directive** (`plugin-markdown`) — removed a
    `react/no-danger` disable whose plugin is not loaded in the flat config (an
    unknown-rule reference that ESLint v10 reports as an error); the rationale is
    kept as a plain comment.

### Patch Changes

- 1dc6061: fix(build): inline dynamic imports in library outputs

  Library `vite build --lib` outputs were emitting separate code-split chunks
  (`rolldown-runtime-*.js`, `LookupField-*.js`, etc.) when source files used
  `React.lazy()` / dynamic `import()`. When consumer apps re-bundled these
  multi-file dists, the library's per-chunk rolldown-runtime collided with the
  consumer's own runtime, causing "TypeError: i is not a function" at runtime
  when lazy components tried to register themselves (e.g. TextField in
  `@object-ui/fields` after 4.0.4).

  Adding `output.inlineDynamicImports: true` to all `@object-ui/*` library vite
  configs forces a single `dist/index.js` per package, which lets consumer
  bundlers handle the library as an opaque ESM module without identifier
  mismatches across chunks.

  Affected packages: components, fields, layout, plugin-aggrid, plugin-ai,
  plugin-calendar, plugin-charts, plugin-chatbot, plugin-dashboard,
  plugin-designer, plugin-detail, plugin-editor, plugin-form, plugin-gantt,
  plugin-grid, plugin-kanban, plugin-list, plugin-map, plugin-markdown,
  plugin-report, plugin-timeline, plugin-view, plugin-workflow.

## 4.0.4

### Patch Changes

- d2b6ece: fix: externalize all bare imports in library builds

  Library builds (vite lib mode) now externalize every non-relative import instead of bundling third-party CJS dependencies into the published dist. This avoids inlined `require("react")` / `require("react-dom")` calls that cause `Calling \`require\` for "react" in an environment that doesn't expose the \`require\` function` runtime errors when consumer apps re-bundle the published dist.

  Specifically fixes:

  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` no longer inlines `react-grid-layout` (and its transitive `react-draggable` / `react-resizable` CJS bundles). `react-grid-layout` is now declared as a peer dependency so consumers install a single ESM-friendly copy.
  - `@object-ui/components`, `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/plugin-charts`, `@object-ui/plugin-designer` no longer inline `react-i18next` / `i18next` / `use-sync-external-store` CJS shims.
  - All plugin packages now use a unified `external: (id) => !/^[./]/.test(id) && !id.startsWith(__dirname)` rule, ensuring future additions of CJS deps are automatically externalized.

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).

### Patch Changes

- e93fe35: Mobile UX round 3 — Gantt and Map

  **@object-ui/plugin-gantt**

  - Added a sticky vertical "Today" marker on the timeline plus a one-tap **Jump to Today** toolbar button so on-call users can re-orient the view instantly on small screens.
  - Added a **collapsible task list** (toolbar toggle + auto-collapse on the first narrow render) so the timeline area gets the full viewport on phones.
  - Added **pinch-to-zoom** touch gestures on the timeline; wired `columnWidthOverride` state so the existing zoom buttons also respond (previously a no-op).

  **@object-ui/plugin-map**

  - Added a **geolocate button** with the standard `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` permission flow, an inline error banner, a busy state, and a **user-location marker** (blue dot) the map flies to on success.
  - **Cluster tap-through**: tapping a cluster now flies the map in (zoom + 2, capped at 20) instead of just sitting there.
  - On mobile, the desktop popup is replaced by a **bottom-sheet record card** with safe-area padding and an explicit close button. Desktop continues to use the popup.
