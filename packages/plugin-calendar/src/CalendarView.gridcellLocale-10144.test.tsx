/**
 * objectui#10144 — the month gridcell's accessible name must be spoken in the
 * SAME resolved locale as the weekday headers standing beside it.
 *
 * This is `Intl` ARGUMENT routing, not a locale pack: the day label is produced
 * by `Date.prototype.toLocaleDateString`, and before this card that call was
 * handed the literal `"default"` — i.e. the MACHINE's locale — while the
 * weekday column headers one row above were handed the component's resolved
 * `locale`. A screen-reader user on a German session therefore heard German
 * column headers and every date in whatever the runtime happened to be set to.
 *
 * ## Why a NON-`en` locale is mandatory here
 *
 * On a runner whose default is `en-US`, an `en` assertion renders the same
 * bytes on the defect and on the fix, so it would pass either way. The two
 * worlds only separate under a locale the runtime default is not.
 *
 * ## The lit control, in the same run as every finding
 *
 * A "the date is not the runtime default's rendering" assertion is only a
 * reading if something in the SAME render proves the locale actually reached
 * this component. The weekday column headers carry that: they were formatted
 * with the resolved `locale` BEFORE this card, so under `de` they must read
 * German on the defect tree too. If they read German and the gridcell does
 * not, the gridcell is the component's own doing — not a provider that never
 * switched language.
 *
 * ## The vacuity guard
 *
 * Every assertion below compares against `toLocaleDateString("default", …)`
 * evaluated live. On a runner whose default IS German that comparison cannot
 * discriminate, so the first case asserts the two renderings differ and fails
 * loudly rather than letting the rest of the file pass while asserting nothing.
