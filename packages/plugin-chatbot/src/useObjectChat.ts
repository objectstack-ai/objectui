/**
 * What `useObjectChat` actually emits — from `messages` and from the
 * `onSend(content, messages)` callback fed from it (objectui#4424).
 *
 * The hook used to declare both as the `@object-ui/types` AUTHORING contract.
 * In local mode that was true; in API mode it was a cast over values produced
 * by the RUNTIME mapper, so the declared type was narrower than the values in
 * exactly the direction that hides capability: anyone rebuilding a message
 * field-by-field from its declared type deleted the HITL approval card, the
 * "Review N changes" affordance, the proposed-plan card, the build panel and
 * the inline charts, with the compiler agreeing.
 *
 * This type is what the survey found to be true of BOTH modes — neither the
 * authoring type nor the runtime type, but the shape that admits both:
 *
 *   - **wide where local mode is wide.** An authored `'tool'` role and the
 *     legacy `'partial-call'`/`'call'`/`'result'` tool states reach this
 *     surface unchanged and are folded only at the render seam, which is the
 *     decision `chatMessageAdapter.ts` records. So the runtime type would have
 *     been a lie about local mode.
 *   - **wide where API mode is wide.** The AI SDK's three approval states
 *     (`approval-requested`, `approval-responded`, `output-denied`) are
 *     runtime-only — the authoring contract refuses them (objectui#10018) —
 *     but API mode produces them, so its tool invocations carry them. So the
 *     authoring type would have been a lie about API mode.
 *   - **narrow where BOTH modes are narrow.** `timestamp` is `string`, never
 *     `Date`: API mode never produces one and local mode absorbs it in
 *     `normalizeMessages` before it is ever handed out. Declaring `Date` here
 *     asks every consumer to handle a value that cannot arrive.
 *   - **plus the render-only keys API mode really carries** —
 *     `buildProgress`, `blueprintProgress`, `charts`, and the HITL /
 *     draft-review / proposed-plan / builder-handoff extensions on each tool
 *     invocation.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is NOT a subtype of `@object-ui/types`' `ChatMessage` (objectui#10018).
 * It was one until the authoring `state` union shed the three runtime-only
 * approval states; the values did not change, the authoring contract did. So a
 * host `onSend` callback that declares its parameter as the authoring
 * `ChatMessage[]` no longer type-checks — it was being handed states that
 * contract refuses. Declare it as `ObjectChatMessage[]`. `ChatbotSchema.onSend`
 * (the schema's runtime slot, forwarded here by the three renderers) is typed
 * with the authoring shape widened by exactly those three states, and this type
 * is assignable to it.

 * objectui#5605 — `maxToolRoundtrips` is an authorable, documented key that

 *
 * The installed chat runtime is `@ai-sdk/react`'s `useChat`, whose options are
 * `ChatInit` plus `{ throttle, experimental_throttle, resume }`. `ChatInit`
 * carries exactly one loop control — `sendAutomaticallyWhen`, a boolean
 * predicate — and no numeric cap of any spelling: `@ai-sdk/react@1.0.0` shipped
 * "remove deprecated useChat roundtrip options" as a MAJOR, and the successor
 * `maxSteps` was renamed through `continueUntil` to `stopWhen`/`stepCountIs`,
 * which the installed `ai` package declares ONLY on `generateText`,
 * `streamText` and `ToolLoopAgentSettings` — all server-side. This hook also
 * never passes `sendAutomaticallyWhen`, so the client performs no automatic
 * tool round-trips at all: there is no client loop here to cap.
 *
 * Nor is there a server loop we own. ObjectUI is backend-agnostic — `api` is
 * whatever endpoint the author names — so shipping the number in the request
 * body would only move the same dead key one hop further out, onto a wire
 * contract no backend reads. The platform's own cap is `maxIterations` on the
 * agent (`planning.maxIterations`), a different key with a different default.
 *
 * So the honest state is retirement, and retirement is two-stage (maintainer
 * ruling, 2026-08-22 item 13). This is STAGE 1: the key keeps parsing and keeps
 * its declared shape, so nothing an author already wrote breaks — but an author
 * who actually writes it is now TOLD it is inert, instead of being left
 * believing the documented cap applies. Stage 2 deletes it.
 *
 * Warned once per process: the hook re-runs on every render, and three renderer
 * call sites feed it. Reset seam for tests, same shape as `plugin-detail`'s

 *     only for a `dynamic-tool` part. Dropping it is behaviour-preserving.
 *   - **the legacy authoring states are FOLDED, not passed through.**
 *     `partial-call` / `call` / `result` are not runtime states; passing them
 *     through left `isToolState` in `mapMessages.ts` refusing them, so the
