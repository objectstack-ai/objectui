/**
 * `objectFields` is a PROP, no longer a key read off the `schema` bag
 * (objectui#7742, ADR-0049, maintainer decision batch #70, 2026-09-07).
 *
 * ## What moved, and why it was a defect
 *
 * `objectFields` carries the fetched object's field definitions so that a
 * conditional-formatting rule comparing a RELATION field sees the stored
 * foreign key rather than the record the board's `$expand` substituted for it
 * (objectui#3501). Only `ObjectKanban` can know the answer — it is the one
 * entry point that fetches an object definition.
 *
 * It used to travel INSIDE the `schema` bag. That made it reachable by an
 * AUTHOR: `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`, `SchemaRenderer` hands the node
 * down, and on the schema-only `kanban-ui` entry — which has no object schema
 * of its own to overwrite it with — an authored `objectFields` reached
 * `resolveConditionalFormatting` verbatim. No schema face declared the key, so
 * nothing judged it either: an author could hand the predicate layer a
 * fabricated field catalogue and change which cards a rule matched. Batch #70
 * ruled it an internal channel; it is now a React PROP, a sibling of `schema`.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Scope — what the move closes, and what it does NOT
 *
 * It closes the SCHEMA READ PATH, which is exactly what the assertions below
 * pin: `KanbanRenderer` no longer reads `schema.objectFields`. On the `'kanban'`
 * arm that closes the key outright — `ObjectKanbanRenderer` serves that type key
 * and discards its rest-spread (`void _props;`), so an authored `objectFields`
 * on a `type: 'kanban'` node reaches nothing.
 *
 * ⛔ It does NOT make `objectFields` author-unreachable in general, and this
 * file must not be read as claiming that. `objectFields` is absent from
 * `SchemaRenderer`'s stripped-metadata list, so on the schema-only `'kanban-ui'`
 * entry an authored `objectFields` survives that renderer's generic prop spread
 * and arrives on the very prop asserted below. The tests here render
 * `KanbanRenderer` DIRECTLY and so never exercise `SchemaRenderer`: that entry
 * is measured but NOT pinned here, and closing it is a separate change.
 *
 * ## How this file discriminates, and why the fixture is shaped this way
 *
 * The two channels are told apart by an outcome that ONLY the field catalogue
 * can produce. The card's `owner` arrives EXPANDED (`{ _id: 'u1' }`), and the
 * rule compares `owner` against the bare id `'u1'`:
 *
 *   - with a catalogue naming `owner` a `lookup`, `toPredicateRecord` collapses
 *     the expanded value back to `'u1'`, the rule MATCHES, and the card is
 *     painted;
 *   - with no catalogue, `owner` stays an object, the rule does NOT match, and
 *     the card is unpainted.
 *
 * So "painted" is a positive reading of the channel and "unpainted" is a
 * negative one — and the positive case is asserted FIRST, as the firing control
 * for the negative. Without it, "the schema key did nothing" would also be
 * produced by a fixture that never worked on either channel, which is the
 * failure mode this pairing exists to rule out.
