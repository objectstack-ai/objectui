Relationship-target readers resolve a lookup's target from `reference` alone,
dropping the `reference_to` fallback arm (objectui#6837, half 2).

Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-31, 原文照录: 「objectui不是前端的项目吗?后端的元数据只要
对,前端按协议执行就行了呀」. Protocol normalization belongs on the SERVER; the front
end just executes the protocol. objectstack#13847 landed the server half — a
`field-reference-to-alias` conversion rewrites stored `reference_to` to
`reference` on the serve path and in `os migrate meta`.

`reference` is the only target spelling `@objectstack/spec`'s `FieldSchema`
declares. Measured on the installed 17.2.0: it refuses `reference_to`,
`referenceTo` and `target` with `unrecognized_keys`, each carrying its own
"Did you mean -> `reference`?" rename, while a nonsense key gets the same
refusal with NO rename hint and `reference` parses clean.

## ⚠️ BREAKING for a hand-written schema that spells `reference_to` — read this

**This is a behaviour change for BYO consumers, and it is being stated rather
than shipped silently.** ObjectUI is usable without an ObjectStack backend
(`examples/byo-backend-console`), and a hand-written TypeScript schema passes
through no zod door, so nothing rejects the legacy spelling at authoring time.

**The break surface is narrower than "all BYO consumers", and this is the
measurement rather than a blanket claim.** Two ingestion choke points stamp both
snake_case keys from whichever spelling arrived — `MetadataProvider`'s type
cache for metadata type `object`, and `ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema`. Any
def that passed either one already carries `reference` and is **completely
unaffected**. What is affected is exactly:

- **A `DataSource` implementation other than `ObjectStackAdapter`.**
  `getObjectSchema` is a required member of the published `DataSource`
  interface, and the readers call it on the generic `dataSource` (through
  `useSettledSchema` and directly), so a host adapter's object schema reaches
  them raw. Every in-repo example of one is on this path:
  `ApiDataSource`, `ValueDataSource`, `packages/types/examples/rest-data-source.ts`,
  `examples/byo-backend-console/src/mockDataSource.ts`,
  `packages/runner/src/lib/mockDataSource.ts`,
  `apps/site/app/components/galleryDataSource.ts`,
  `apps/console/src/sdui-workbench-preview.tsx`,
  `packages/plugin-grid/demo/bulk-actions.tsx`.

**Measured on this tree, none of those eight emits a relationship target at all** —
`reference_to` and `reference` are both zero in each, and
`examples/byo-backend-console` carries no lookup or master_detail field
anywhere (its only `reference` hits are a vite triple-slash directive and a
tsconfig `references` array). The single in-repo producer that WAS on this
surface, `packages/plugin-gantt/demo/main.tsx`, is fixed here at the producer.

⇒ **If you author object metadata by hand and spell a lookup's target
`reference_to`, rename that key to `reference`.** Symptom if you do not: the
target silently fails to resolve, and the affected surface degrades rather than
erroring — a related list is not derived, a gantt quick filter falls back to the
distinct values in the loaded rows instead of the referenced object's full
domain, a tree stops auto-detecting its parent pointer, a lookup cell shows a
raw id, a chart's group-by labels stay unresolved.

The ingestion choke point now emits a **dev-mode warning** when a def arrives
carrying only `reference_to` or `referenceTo` and no `reference`. It names the
object, the field and the offending key, and points at this ruling. Stamping is
deliberately unchanged, so nothing that worked stops working. It is memoised
once per **(object name, field name, spelling, target value)** — every segment
of that key is pinned, in both directions, in
`reference-keys.legacyWarning-6837.test.ts`.

⛔ **This warning does NOT cover the break described above, and it is worth being
exact about that rather than letting it read as mitigation.** It lives in
`normalizeFieldReferenceKeys`, reachable only through
`normalizeSchemaReferenceKeys`, which has exactly two production call sites —
`MetadataProvider` (metadata type `object`) and
`ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema`. Both of those also STAMP the def, so the
warning fires precisely where the def still resolves and nothing is broken. A
hand-written schema served through any OTHER `DataSource` — the break surface —
reaches a reader raw: it never passes through this code and produces **no
warning at all**. On that path the failure is exactly as silent as before.
A reader-side or shared-resolver diagnostic, which would cover it, remains open
on objectui#6837.

⚠️ **Dated note, 2026-09-29 — the call-site count above has since moved —
objectui#7650.** "exactly two production call sites" above held when this change landed
(`045d20ba8`). Later in this same release objectui#7650 (PR objectui#8868) added a call
on `MetadataProvider`'s by-name object-schema serve path. Re-measured for objectui#10979
on `main` at `2eaf5be27`, `normalizeSchemaReferenceKeys` had three production call sites:
two in `MetadataProvider`, on its list path and on its by-name path, and one in
`ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema`.
`.changeset/7650-metadata-item-reference-canonicalisation.md` (PR objectui#8868) states
what ships; the text above is kept as the reading of this change.

## What did NOT change

**Every key these readers EMIT is byte-identical**, and that was verified
mechanically over the whole diff rather than asserted. Eleven of the sixteen
sites write a target onto a bag whose own contract spells it `reference_to` (or
camelCase `referenceTo`): the six whose read and write share a line —
`RecordDetailDrawer`, `RelatedList`, `buildDefaultPageSchema`, `ListView`,
`FilterConditionField`, `resolveActionParams` — plus five more that read on one
line and emit on another, and so are just as much emitters: `RecordDetailView`,
`RecordMetaFooter`, `ObjectGallery`, `fieldEnrichment` (all `reference_to`) and
`UserFilters` (`referenceTo`). Only the right-hand read narrowed anywhere; the
emitted key is what its target contract declares, and renaming it would be a
separate change.

**Three readers were deliberately left alone.** `LookupCellRenderer`
(`fields/src/index.tsx`), `LookupField` and `UserField` read `FieldMetadata` —
ObjectUI's OWN contract, whose `LookupFieldMetadata` declares `reference_to` and
never declares `reference`. They are fed by the emitters above and by published
example schemas (`examples/schema-catalog/src/schemas/fields-lookup/*.json`), so
narrowing them would break in-repo producers, and `plugin-grid`'s
`relationalMetaCopySet.derivation.test.ts` re-derives its read set from exactly
those three sources — where `reference_to` is recorded with verdict
`adapter-stamped`. `DetailViewFieldSchema` is likewise untouched.

⚠️ **Dated note, 2026-09-30 — the stamp, the three readers and the emitted key have since moved — objectui#11070.** Later in this same release objectui#11070 (round 4) retired `reference_to` inside ObjectUI as well. `normalizeFieldReferenceKeys` now FOLDS a legacy `reference_to` / `referenceTo` onto `reference` and no longer stamps `reference_to`, so "Stamping is deliberately unchanged" and "stamp both snake_case keys" above no longer describe what ships. `LookupCellRenderer`, `LookupField` and `UserField` read `reference` only; `LookupFieldMetadata`, `MasterDetailFieldMetadata` and `DetailViewField` (with `DetailViewFieldSchema`) declare `reference`; and the emitters listed under "What did NOT change" write `reference`. A hand-written schema served through a `DataSource` other than `ObjectStackAdapter` that spells only `reference_to` therefore also loses the lookup picker's target and the read cell's name. `.changeset/11070-reference-to-round4.md` states what ships; the text above is kept as the reading of this change.
