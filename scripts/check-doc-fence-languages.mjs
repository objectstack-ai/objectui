 * A fenced block whose BODY is TypeScript must be fenced `ts` / `tsx` /

 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-doc-fence-languages.mjs   (also `pnpm check:doc-fences`)
 *       node scripts/check-doc-fence-languages.mjs --self-test
 *       node scripts/check-doc-fence-languages.mjs --list
 * Exit: 0 = no TypeScript block sits under a non-TypeScript fence beyond the
 *       declared, shrink-only debt below. 1 = one does, or the debt list is
 *       stale.
 *
 * ## The hole this closes (objectui#6135, measured, not predicted)
 *
 * `check-doc-snippet-types` compiles `ts` / `tsx` / `typescript` fences and
 * nothing else, so a TypeScript block fenced any other way is invisible to it —
 * that is objectui#5867, and its remediation lane collects the population by
 * walking ```plaintext fences.
 *
 * ⚠️ `plaintext` is not the only spelling of an unhighlighted fence, and until
 * this file landed nothing pinned the vocabulary. Re-running objectui#5867's own
 * derivation on `origin/main` with the fence-language set widened by `text` and
 * `plain`, and nothing else changed, moves the population by exactly one block.
 * Measured twice, because objectui#5867's batches were landing underneath this
 * card while it was written — the delta is stable, the totals are not:
 *
 *                                      at bfdb9f906   at 273537957
 *     plaintext                        127 / 91       104 / 82
 *     plaintext + text + plain         128 / 92       105 / 83
 *     …+ txt + no info string at all   128 / 92       105 / 83
 *
 * (blocks / files. The 23 blocks across 9 files that left between those two
 * readings are objectui#5867 batch 4, PR #6136, plus PR #6137 — which is exactly
 * what the SHRINK-ONLY baseline below is for, and it caught the drift itself.)
 *
 * The block the wider set adds is `content/docs/components/form/file-upload.mdx:27`,
 * a ```text fence opening `interface FileUploadSchema {`. It had been outside the
 * lane's population — and outside the gate — the whole time, for no reason other
 * than how its fence is spelled.
 *
 * Widening the lane's derivation once fixes that one block. It does NOT stop a
 * sixth spelling reopening the identical gap tomorrow, and the 2026-08-24 ruling
 * on objectui#6135 (route "A then C") is explicit that the durable half is the
 * point: "A alone chases spellings … Fixing the lane's arithmetic without pinning
 * the vocabulary means this card gets refiled under a different fence name."
 *
 * ## Why this reads BODIES rather than pinning a list of languages
 *
 * The obvious shape — enumerate the allowed fence languages and ban the rest —
 * was measured and rejected here, because the enumeration IS the thing that
 * rots. It has to be extended every time a page picks up a new highlighter
 * language, each extension is a place to get it wrong, and the failure direction
 * is silent: a spelling nobody added is a spelling nobody notices.
 *
 * Reading the body removes the list from the load-bearing path entirely. The
 * question asked of every fence is triage's, not this file's:
 *
 *     a block whose first line starts with `import` / `export` / `interface` /
 *     `type X =` / `const x: T` IS code
 *
 * — objectui#5867's binding triage ruling, 2026-08-24. ⛔ That classifier is
 * quoted here, not extended: this gate widens WHICH FENCES are examined, never
 * what counts as code. Those are two different edges and only the second was
 * ruled. A block that fails the classifier is prose and this gate says nothing
 * about it, whatever its fence says.
 *
 * The consequence is the property the ruling asked for: `txt`, `console`, `raw`,
 * `output`, a bare ``` with no info string at all — none of them is named
 * anywhere in the enforcement path, and every one of them fails the moment it
 * carries a TypeScript body.
 *
 * ## The two failure modes, because only one of them can be auto-classified
 *
 * SYNONYM   the fence is a KNOWN spelling of an unhighlighted block —
 *           `plaintext`, `text`, `plain`, `txt`, or no info string at all
 *           (`UNHIGHLIGHTED_SPELLINGS`). The gate knows exactly what this is:
 *           objectui#5867's population, one block of it. The remedy is
 *           mechanical — re-fence it `ts` or `tsx` — so it is the only mode a
 *           baseline entry can describe.
 *
 * UNKNOWN   the fence names something else — a spelling nobody has thought of.
 *           The gate CANNOT auto-classify it: `raw` might be a sixth synonym of
 *           an unhighlighted fence, or a real highlighter language whose block
 *           happens to open with `import`. Deciding which is a human's call, so
 *           this mode ⛔ can never be baselined and fails on sight. There are
 *           ZERO of them in the tree today, which is what makes "never
 *           baselined" affordable rather than aspirational.
 *
 * `UNHIGHLIGHTED_SPELLINGS` therefore chooses a MESSAGE, never a verdict. Adding
 * a spelling to it moves a finding from UNKNOWN to SYNONYM; it does not excuse
 * the block, because SYNONYM findings still have to be inside a shrink-only
 * baseline that no supported route adds to. There is no edit to this file that
 * makes a new TypeScript-under-a-non-TypeScript-fence block pass.
 *
 * ## The baseline, and why it is the lane's population rather than a permit
 *
 * ⛔ SHRINK-ONLY, in the shape objectui#6133 landed for
 * `KNOWN_HAND_TYPED_GUARDS`: `path -> number of SYNONYM blocks the file carried
 * when this gate landed`. A count rather than a bare path, for that card's third
 * reason, which is the one that matters — a path-only baseline silently accepts a
 * SECOND hidden block being smuggled into an already-owed file.
 *
 *   • a file NOT in the map that carries one fails — a new hidden block cannot land;
 *   • a file IN the map carrying MORE than its number fails;
 *   • a file carrying FEWER fails as STALE and names itself, the remedy being to
 *     lower or delete the line. No supported route raises a number.
 *
 * The map is not a debt list this gate invented. It IS objectui#5867's remaining
 * population, per file, machine-readable and in the repository — 83 entries and
 * 105 blocks at the commit this landed on, reconciling exactly with that card's
 * own derivation. Every batch of that lane now lowers these numbers in the same
 * pull request that re-fences the blocks, which is what stops the lane's
 * arithmetic from being a figure re-derived by hand in each handback and trusted
 * by the next dispatch. When the last entry goes, so does the map, and the rule
 * above stands alone.
 *
 * ## What it reads, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * The scan surface is `check-doc-snippet-types`'s, exactly: every `.mdx` and
 * `.md` under `content/docs`, every `packages/<name>/README.md`, the root
 * `README.md` (objectui#7115), and every `.mdx` / `.md` under
 * `apps/<app>/docs/**` (objectui#6600). The full ownership map for all three doc
 * gates — including the trees NO gate reads — is stated once in
 * `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs`, beside `UNGATED_DOCS`; this gate's roots are
 * that gate's roots by construction, which is the pin below.
 * It is re-implemented here rather than imported so
 * this gate needs NO install — that gate imports `typescript`, and an
 * install-gated docs check is one that a docs-only pull request skips, which is
 * the shape objectui#5174 and `doc-component-types.yml`'s header both record as
 * the hole. The copy is not left to drift:
 * `scripts/__tests__/check-doc-fence-languages.test.ts` imports BOTH walks and
 * fails if they ever return different document lists, and pins this file's
 * TypeScript-fence set against the gate's own `TS_FENCE_LANGUAGES`.
 *
 * ⭐ That coupling pin is not decoration — it is what CAUGHT objectui#7115.
 * That card widened the two gates its ruling named onto the root `README.md`
 * and this one, the third, went red on `walks exactly the documents the snippet
 * gate walks` before anybody had thought to look for a third. The install-free
 * copy is deliberate; the pin is what makes a deliberate copy safe, and it did
 * the job it was written for.
 *
 * ⛔ It compiles nothing. Whether a block that reaches a `ts` fence then passes
 * `--strict` is `check-doc-snippet-types`'s question; this gate only makes sure
 * the block is asked.
