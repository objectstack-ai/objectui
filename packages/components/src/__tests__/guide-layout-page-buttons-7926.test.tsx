/**
 * The layout guide's action passages DRAW BUTTONS (objectui#7926, maintainer
 * ruling 2026-09-09, decision batch #107 item 2 — option A).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists beside the schema pin
 *
 * The ruling names two pins, and they are not interchangeable. The contract half
 * — "`actions` on a `page` node is refused at parse" — lives in
 * `packages/types/src/__tests__/page-actions-refusal-7926.test.ts`. It is
 * satisfied by DELETING the key from the guide, which is exactly the outcome the
 * ruling calls out as a failure: docs edited, still nothing drawn.
 *
 * So this file asserts the RENDERED RESULT, through the real `SchemaRenderer` and
 * the real renderers, on the fences as they are committed. It is the load-bearing
 * half.
 *
 * ## The measurement this replaces
 *
 * objectui#7926 measured the old shape end to end:
 *
 *     page node with actions: [{type:'button',label:'Add Product'}, {…}]
 *       -> buttons found in the DOM: 0
 *       -> "Add Product" appears anywhere in the DOM: false
 *     the SAME two buttons moved into page.body
 *       -> buttons found in the DOM: 2   texts: ["Add Product","Export"]
 *
 * `renders nothing when authored as page.actions` below is that first reading
 * kept as a LIVE CONTROL. Without it, "at least one button" would be satisfied by
 * a renderer that draws a button for any input at all, and the assertion could
 * not fail for the reason it exists.
 *
 * ## The passages are DERIVED, not listed
 *
 * A hand-maintained list of line numbers or headings is the artefact that rots.
 * The sections are found by their heading text matching /action/i, and the fences
 * inside them by parsing; the count is pinned so a passage that quietly loses its
 * fence reddens instead of shrinking the population to zero and passing.
 *
 * ⚠️ `content/docs/**` is EXCLUDED from `ci.yml`'s full-run decision on
 * `pull_request` (`ci.yml`'s "Decide whether this change needs a full run" step),
 * so a green PR page is NOT evidence that this file ran on a docs-only edit. It is
 * placed in `packages/components` — a package a `page`/`button` change does move —
 * on purpose.
 *
 * Module-scope import of the renderers, not `beforeAll` (AGENTS.md §测试纪律):
 * registering them is an unbounded module load and must not be billed to a
 * bounded hook timeout.
