/**
 * `ConditionBuilder`'s CEL placeholder may not TEACH a root the same mount does
 * not OFFER — objectui#9952, the third door of the trap objectui#9645
 * (autocomplete) and objectui#9855 (subject dropdown) closed at two other
 * controls.
 *
 * ## The defect these cases reproduce
 *
 * The placeholder was a string literal handed to `CelPredicateField` at EVERY
 * mount — `record.status != 'done' && user.isAdmin` — while the very same
 * component had already narrowed a record-scoped mount's autocomplete to
 * `RECORD_CONDITION_ROOTS`, which carries no `user`. At a server-evaluated
 * mount that root is not merely unadvertised: `conditionScope.ts` states in its
 * own words that a hook `condition` and a validation rule's guard are evaluated
 * with `{ record, previous }` and only those, fail-CLOSED at the validation
 * host — and objectstack's `wrapDeclarativeHook` docblock says the condition
 * formula is evaluated against two bindings, `record` and `previous`. So the
 * one line an author reads BEFORE typing anything taught a root the evaluator
 * never binds, and copying it costs the author the write.
 *
 * ## The pin asserts a RELATION, never the string
 *
 * ⛔ No case below asserts what the placeholder SAYS. Each reads whatever the
 * editor shows and requires every root in it to be a member of the set that
 * mount offers. A pin on the literal would go green again the day someone
 * re-hard-codes one, which is the defect itself.
 *
 * `celRootsMentioned` is the instrument, so a case proves it can FAIL before
 * any case trusts it: `control A` feeds it the OLD literal at the record-scoped
 * mount's offered set and requires a rejection.
 *
 * ## Read from the DOM, not from the helper
 *
 * The subject case renders the real component and reads the real `placeholder`
 * attribute. Asking `celExampleForRoots` directly would leave the JSX free to
 * go on passing a literal with every case still green — the wiring is half of
 * what is under test.
