 * objectui#7862 — COMPILES the file the `Export to React` command hands a user,
 * rather than reading substrings out of the generator that writes it.
 *
 * WHY A COMPILE AND NOT A SECOND SOURCE-TEXT PIN. The sibling pin
 * (`export-to-react-preamble.test.ts`, objectui#7837) asserts that named
 * strings are present or absent in the template. That instrument can only ever
 * catch the defects someone already thought to name: it was green for the whole
 * life of `import React from 'react'`, a line it never mentions, and it would be
 * green for the next line added to the preamble too. The preamble lives inside a
 * TEMPLATE LITERAL, so this package's `tsc --noEmit` sees one string, `tsup`
 * copies it through, and no doc gate's scan surface reaches this file. Compiling
 * the product closes the whole class instead of one member of it: any preamble
 * line that does not type-check — an unused binding, a syntax error, a JSX shape
 * the renderer does not accept — fails here without anyone having predicted it.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS WAS BUILT FOR. `generateReactComponent()` opened every file
 * with `import React from 'react'` while the only JSX in the file is one
 * SchemaRenderer element. Under the automatic runtime (`"jsx": "react-jsx"`,
 * what a new Vite or Next project is configured with) the identifier is never
 * read, so a consumer compiling with `noUnusedLocals: true` got
 * `TS6133: 'React' is declared but its value is never read` on the file the
 * command had just handed them.
 *
 * WHY THE MODULE STUBS ARE HERMETIC, NOT THE REAL `dist/index.d.ts`. The card
 * took its readings against the built declarations of `@object-ui/react` and
 * `@object-ui/components`. A TEST cannot: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the
 * test job as `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` followed by `pnpm test`, with no
 * build step between them, so both `dist/` trees are ABSENT there. Resolving to
 * them would make this file emit a TS2307 storm in CI — a red test that reports
 * a missing build rather than a defect in the template, which is the worst kind
 * of pin. The property under test is a property of the emitted TEXT — does the
 * preamble declare a binding no line of the file reads — and that is decided by
 * the compiler with any declaration for those specifiers. Import SHAPE against
 * the real packages stays the sibling pin's job; the two are complementary.
 *
 * WHY THE EXTRACTION IS DUPLICATED FROM THE SIBLING PIN. A shared helper would
 * have to be a non-`.test.ts` file under `src/`: `tsconfig.test.json` includes
 * only the `.test.ts` files under `src/`, so the helper would go unchecked,
 * while `tsconfig.json` excludes only those same files, so it WOULD land in the
 * build program and ship inside the `.vsix`. Twenty duplicated lines cost less.

/**
 * objectui#7976 — BINDS the two hand-kept documentation mirrors of the preamble
 * to the preamble `generateReactComponent()` actually emits.
 *
 * WHY. Two documents transcribe that preamble by hand, and nothing held either
 * to the original: the template lives inside a TEMPLATE LITERAL, so this
 * package's `tsc --noEmit` sees one string, and `DESIGN.md` is markdown in a
 * package whose README is the only file the doc gates' surfaces name. Both
 * copies could drift indefinitely with every gate green. Hand-correction had
 * been spent three times before this pin existed — objectui#7837, objectui#7978
 * and objectui#8112 — and the third re-created the defect while fixing it: it
 * hand-copied the product byte for byte and asserted the equality in its PULL
 * REQUEST DESCRIPTION, which ran once, in one session, and is not in the tree.
 * objectui#7914's ruling is that the control demonstrating the catch belongs in
 * the FILE. This is that file.
 *
 * ⛔ WHAT THIS PIN DOES NOT SEE — read this before trusting it.
 *
 * It binds the PREAMBLE ONLY: the lines above `const schema =`. Everything
 * BELOW that line is unbound and can still drift out of both documents
 * silently — the component name `GeneratedComponent`, the returned JSX, and the
 * `export default` line. It also says nothing about prose OUTSIDE the fence:
 * the sentence claiming the output went to the clipboard (objectui#7977) was
 * false for as long as it stood, and no fence assertion would have caught it,
 * because it was a paragraph and not code.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE WHOLE BLOCK, WHICH WOULD SEE ALL OF THAT. Whole-block verbatim
 * equality is RED on BOTH copies today, and neither red is a defect:
 * `DESIGN.md` assigns `const schema` a braces-with-a-comment placeholder naming
 * the user's schema, where the
 * generator interpolates the real thing, and the `.mdx` was evaluated against
 * the example schema that page teaches rather than this file's `SAMPLE_SCHEMA`.
 * Widening to the whole block would mean editing both documents to fit the
 * test. ⛔ Sanding a document to fit its pin is not available: the readable
 * placeholder is the document doing its job. So the pin is drawn at the widest
 * line that is green on both copies UNCHANGED, and its blind half is named here
 * rather than left for a reader to discover.
 *
 * NOTE the four-line `// No React import:` comment is NOT a readability
 * addition someone made to the docs — it is inside the returned template
 * literal, so it is emitted into every user's file. It is product, and this pin
 * holds the documents to it rather than exempting it.
