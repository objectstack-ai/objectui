A half-filled relationship field stays in the client and is never PUT (objectui#7714,
maintainer ruling on objectui#7122 item 4, 2026-09-05).

**Breaking, deliberately, and stated rather than implied.** Both metadata writers —
`MetadataService.saveFields` / `saveObject` in `@object-ui/app-shell`, and
`MetadataFieldsPage` in `@object-ui/plugin-designer` — now REFUSE a `lookup` or
`master_detail` field whose `reference` is missing, empty, blank or not a string. A
caller that previously got a PUT now gets a thrown error and **no request at all**. The
refusal is raised while the wire `fields` map is being built, so nothing is sent and
nothing is partially applied.

**Why the draft may not leave the client.** `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 turned
`reference` from prose into a hard requirement on relationship types (a `custom`
refinement at path `reference`). Driven against a real 17.3.0 backend in a running
designer: creating a `lookup` and leaving its target empty PUT the whole object,
came back `422 INVALID_METADATA` at `fields.<name>.reference` — and then the NEXT
edit, to a different and already-saved field, was refused identically, because the
half-filled draft rides along inside the same document. The author sees that later
edit rendered as applied while the server has none of it, and the only escape that
does not require noticing the lookup is a reload, which discards the work. An editing
session's half-finished state belongs to the client, not to the metadata store.

⛔ **Not** "strip the incomplete field from the body and report a successful save".
That shows the author a field the server never received — the silent-drop shape
objectstack#4001 closed.

**The whitespace row follows the contract; it is not a local opinion.** The predicate
is `typeof reference === 'string' && reference.trim() !== ''`. It was a declared
divergence when written — 17.3.0's objectstack#13632 refinement spelled its emptiness test as an
equality against `''`, so the spec accepted `reference: '   '` while these writers
refused it. objectstack#16920 applies that test to the TRIMMED value, so the spec now
refuses the identical shape under the same `custom` issue at the same `reference`
path, and the divergence note is retired (objectui#8621). Whitespace names no object
at either end (the spec's own `ObjectSchema.fields` key grammar
`/^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$/` admits no whitespace-bearing name), so admitting it would only
move the identical failure past the PUT and into a stored document, where it surfaces
with no field named. ⚠️ objectstack#16920 is an unreleased `minor` upstream and this
repo's pin is `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0, which predates it — so until the pin moves,
these writers are still the only thing refusing `'   '` here, and they refuse it at
editor time either way, before the PUT rather than at the publish gate.

The refusal message diagnoses which of the four states it found — absent, empty,
non-string (`invalid_type`, a value of the wrong kind rather than a missing target),
or blank — because the repair and the consequence differ per state.

`minor` rather than `major` per `AGENTS.md`: objectui's major tracks `@objectstack`'s,
so objectui's own breaking changes ship as `minor` with the breaking semantics stated.
