/**
 * `packages/app-shell/README.md`'s **Visual flow canvas** draft is parsed by the
 * schema that actually validates it — the spec's `FlowSchema` (objectui#8854).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The documented draft could not be saved. Three separate reasons, all in one
 * fence, and none of them visible to any gate this repository runs:
 *
 *   1. it taught the designer's RETIRED `node.ui.{x,y}` geometry spelling, which
 *      the spec's flow node — a strict object — rejects by name. The README's
 *      own prose, twelve lines below the fence, said so: "a draft that still
 *      carries `ui` fails client-side validation and is rejected on save with a
 *      422". Two halves of one section, contradicting each other, and the half a
 *      reader copies was the wrong one;
 *   2. every edge omitted `id`, which `FlowEdgeSchema` declares required beside
 *      `source` and `target`; and
 *   3. the fence carried no `name` / `label` / `type` at all, though it is
 *      captioned as a `flow` DRAFT and `FlowSchema` requires all three.
 *
 * (3) is the one no card named, and it is the reason this test parses the WHOLE
 * object rather than its nodes and edges separately. objectui#8483 repaired one
 * node type in this same fence and the draft still did not save; objectui#8854
 * was filed for two more defects, and had it been graded per-node the draft
 * still would not have saved. A per-part check answers a question no reader
 * asks. What a reader does is paste the fence — so that is what is parsed here.
 *
 * ## The door this parses is the door the app uses
 *
 * Not `FlowNodeSchema` / `FlowEdgeSchema` piecemeal, and not the server: the
 * app-shell metadata admin validates a `flow` draft client-side by handing the
 * whole draft to `FlowSchema`. `clientValidation.ts`'s `LOADERS.flow` resolves
 * that schema and `ResourceEditPage` calls `validateMetadataDraft(type, draft)`
 * with the editor's entire body. Grading the example against anything else would
 * measure a gate no author passes through.
 *
 * ## The example is EXTRACTED, never retyped
 *
 * The fence is read out of the README on every run. A hand copy drifts from the
 * file it claims to pin and therefore pins nothing — an unre-measured snippet is
 * the whole defect this test exists to prevent, so reproducing one inside the
 * test would be self-defeating. A moved heading, a removed fence or a non-JSON
 * body throws out of the extractor rather than vacuously passing on an empty
 * fixture.
 *
 * ## The green carries its own controls
 *
 * A `safeParse` that succeeds proves nothing if the schema accepts everything,
 * so each repaired defect is re-injected into the extracted example and must be
 * REFUSED by name. Three mutations, three refusals — that pairing is the
 * measurement; neither half alone is one.
