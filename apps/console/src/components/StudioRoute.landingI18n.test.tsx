/**
 * objectui#10043 — the Studio front door's wordmark tooltip is keyed, and no
 * pack's language is hardcoded into it.
 *
 * The landing shipped `title=` as a raw Chinese literal: a user-visible string
 * outside i18n entirely, which AGENTS.md commandment #-1 names by category
 * ("component labels, buttons, titles, errors"). Its sibling one route away —
 * `StudioDesignSurface`'s header Home button — has always resolved the same
 * affordance through a catalogue, so the two named the same home in two
 * different mechanisms and, for nine of the ten packs, two different languages.
 *
 * ## Why `t` answers in no natural language here
 *
 * Same reason as `AppManagementPage.i18n.test.tsx`, and the same sentinel: a
 * mock that echoed `defaultValue` would let a component that never called `t`
 * at all pass every assertion, because a hardcoded literal and a correctly
 * keyed lookup are indistinguishable the moment the pack agrees with the
 * source. `t` therefore returns `«key»`, which is what a NON-English pack does
 * to this header in the only respect that matters: the source language
 * disappears.
 *
 * ## Two-sided, and the negative side carries its own control
 *
 * Naming the key is necessary and not sufficient — a stray Han literal could
 * sit beside a correctly keyed one. So the second assertion sweeps the rendered
 * header for Han script. A script-class assertion is exactly the shape
 * AGENTS.md's i18n forensics rule warns can go permanently vacuous, so the
 * regex is pinned against a live positive built from a code point rather than
 * trusted: without that control, a broken `HAN` would report "no Chinese on
 * screen" forever, on a screen full of it.
 *
 * The Han sample is constructed with `String.fromCodePoint` rather than written
 * out, so this file's own bytes stay ASCII under the commandment it enforces.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification
 *
 * Putting the literal back turns BOTH sides red at once: the key's sentinel is
 * missing, and the sweep finds Han in a `title` attribute.
