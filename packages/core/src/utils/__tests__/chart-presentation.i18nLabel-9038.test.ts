/**
 * objectui#9038 — `chartConfigPresentation` DROPPED an inline-locale-map
 * `title` / `subtitle` / `description`, so a chart authored in the spec's own
 * `I18nLabel` union drew **no heading at all**.
 *
 * The old limb was `typeof v === 'string' && v ? v : undefined`. It did not
 * pick the wrong locale — it erased the value, the `if (title)` guard then
 * skipped the assignment, and the key never reached the result. That failure
 * mode is invisible to any check that asks "does the heading match the locale",
 * because there is no heading to compare; the assertions below therefore pin
 * the key's PRESENCE and its identity with the authored value, not a string.
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * This half pins the SEAM: the authored union survives the lowering. It cannot
 * pin that a viewer sees the right limb — resolution happens downstream, in
 * `normalizeChartSchema`'s `label()` against the language `ChartRenderer`
 * reads. The rendered half is
 * `ChartRenderer.presentationLocaleHeading-9038.test.tsx` in
 * `@object-ui/plugin-charts`, which draws the same map at two languages.
 *
 * A green run here over a renderer that had not yet learned the union would be
 * a correct seam feeding a resolver that never sees it — which is exactly why
 * neither half stands alone.
 *
 * ## The key-order control
 *
 * Every locale map below is written **`en` first**. The sibling defect
 * objectui#8943 was a first-string-in-key-order pick, so a map written
 * `zh-CN` first would be satisfied by that defect too; writing `en` first keeps
 * these fixtures able to fail for the reason they exist.
 *
 * PREDICTIONS, written before the run: the `title`/`subtitle`/`description` map
 * cases are RED before the fix (the key is absent) and the plain-string,
 * refusal and untouched-key cases are GREEN on both sides — they pin decisions
 * that must NOT move. The mutation legs are recorded in the pull request.
