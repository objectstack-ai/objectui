/**
 * `@object-ui/core` — ElementDataSource resolution (objectstack#5576).
 *
 * `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` (the spec's `ElementDataSourceSchema`) is the
 * per-element data binding a page component uses to query a different object
 * than the page's own context:
 *
 * ```json
 * { "object": "account", "view": "hot", "filter": { … }, "sort": [ … ], "limit": 20 }
 * ```
 *
 * This module owns the two pure halves of consuming it — telling the METADATA
 * apart from a runtime data-source adapter, and composing a named saved view
 * with the binding's own keys. Both are needed in two places (the render path in
 * `@object-ui/plugin-list`, and `ViewDataProvider.resolveElementDataSource`), so
 * they live here rather than being written twice.
 *
 * ## Composition semantics
 *
 * The spec's own `describe()` text settles the one case that could go either
 * way. `filter` is documented as "**Additional** filter criteria" — additional
 * to what the named view already restricts — so a view filter and a binding
 * filter COMBINE under `and`; the binding can only narrow the view, never widen
 * it. That is also the safe direction for AI-authored metadata: a typo in a
 * per-element filter cannot silently expose rows the saved view excluded.
 *
 * Nothing else in the binding is described as additional, and the remaining keys
 * are single-valued (one ordering, one cap), so for those the rule is **the view
 * provides the baseline and an explicit key overrides it**:
 *
 * | key        | source                                  | rule                        |
 * |------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
 * | `object`   | binding (required)                      | binding wins                |
 * | `columns`  | view only — the binding has no such key | view                        |
 * | `filter`   | view + binding                          | AND-combined ("additional") |
 * | `sort`     | view or binding                         | binding overrides view      |
 * | `limit`    | view (`pagination.pageSize`) or binding | binding overrides view      |
 * | `viewType` | view only                               | view                        |
 *
 * A lone `filter` — only the view has one, or only the binding does — is passed
 * through in the shape it was stored in; only the two-source case is lowered to
 * an ObjectQL AST, because that is what combining requires.
 *
 * `viewType` rides along because `list-view` IS the multi-kind view container
 * (its registry `inputs` enumerate grid/kanban/gallery/…): naming a saved kanban
 * view and rendering a grid would be a silently wrong answer.

/**
 * The message shown when `dataSource.view` names a view the object does not
 * have. Built here so the render path and `ViewDataProvider` report the same
 * defect the same way, and so the known-view list (the thing that actually gets
 * an author unstuck) is never omitted by one caller.
 *
 * ## Why the empty case may not say "this object has no saved views"
 *
 * An EMPTY `knownViews` reaches this function from two different worlds, and
 * this function cannot tell them apart:
 *
 *  1. the saved views were read and there are none;
 *  2. the read never successfully happened.
 *
 * World 2 is not hypothetical and not a bug to be fixed upstream: the shipped
 * `ObjectStackAdapter.listViews` contract degrades EVERY failure — refused,
 * offline, malformed — to `[]` on the RESOLVED path (deliberate, and objectui#8151
 * keeps it), so a broken read arrives at `useElementDataSource` as a successful
 * empty answer. The hook's own discrimination catches a REJECTION, which is a
 * shape that contract never produces, so nothing separates the two worlds by the
 * time the count lands here.
 *
 * Framework decision objectstack#13906 decision 1 option A — *a thing that could
 * not be READ is not a thing that is ABSENT* — therefore binds this branch: it
 * may only assert what is true in BOTH worlds. It names the possibilities and
 * commits to neither, because committing is exactly the claim nobody established.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not "restore" the shorter sentence by inferring failure from emptiness in
 * either direction — emptiness is what both worlds produce, so it can never tell
 * them apart. Saying more than this needs the failure FACT plumbed in from the
 * adapter (objectui#8151's surface), not a better guess here.

/**
 * The authoring-surface declaration of {@link ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_KEY} — the one
 * copy, emitted into every registration that wraps the runtime gate.
 *
 * ## Why it lives here and is injected rather than written per block
 *
 * `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` is READ by `ElementDataSourceGate` in
 * `@object-ui/react` on behalf of every object-bound block that wraps itself in
 * it — nine of them at the time of writing. It was declared by NONE: `validateTree`
 * skips `BASE_PROPS` and otherwise looks a prop up in the component's `inputs`,
 * and `dataSource` was in neither. So the html tier reported the one spelling
 * that resolves a saved view — the only one that works — with the identical
 * `unknown-prop` warning it gives the spellings that do nothing, on the tier
 * meant to accept AI-authored pages, where the diagnostic IS the contract
 * (objectui#6678, the reporter of objectui#6598 gave up on exactly this).
 *
 * The maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29 took option B **in the injection form**:
 * emitted mechanically at the wrapping seam, so a block declares the key from
 * the same place that reads it. Nine hand-kept copies is the shape that ruling
 * refused — they drift, and a tenth block would simply forget. Adding the key to
 * `sdui-parser`'s `BASE_PROPS` (option A) was refused too: that set mirrors
 * `BaseSchema`, and silencing `dataSource` on blocks that do NOT read it
 * (`flex`, `card`) would make the diagnostic lie in the other direction.
 *
 * ## Why `object`, and not a bare `'object'` kind
 *
 * The `binding: 'object'` marker is what tells a consumer this input names an
 * OBJECT — `validateTree` records it as a binding site, and the designer offers
 * an object picker rather than a free-text blob. The `type` stays the coarse
 * `'object'` kind because the value is a record; the two words are unrelated and
 * both are correct here.
 *
 * ## Typed as the framework's injected input (objectui#6950)
 *
 * `binding` is not a `ComponentInput` member. The maintainer ruling of
 * 2026-09-07 answered the card's product question — may an ordinary
 * registration declare a binding input? — with no, so the ONE writer of the
 * key is this constant, typed by `InjectedComponentInput` from
 * `@object-ui/types`: a `ComponentInput` plus the marker. The hand-written
 * inline type literal that used to sit here was the tell that the key had no
 * authored home, and the splice in `Registry.register` reached the `inputs`
 * array through an `as ComponentMeta` cast. Both are gone: the shape is now
 * checked here and at the splice, and a registration that writes `binding`
 * itself is an excess-property `tsc` error.
