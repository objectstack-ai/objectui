 * objectui#6453 — the object schema GATES `ObjectCalendar`'s standalone record
 * query.
 *
 * ## What this replaces
 *
 * The fetch effect built its expand set from a REF (`objectSchemaRef.current`)
 * assigned in the render body, and deliberately omitted `objectSchema` from its
 * dependency list. That bought exactly one effect run per mount — and paid for
 * it with the expansion, permanently: on that one run the ref was still `null`,
 * `buildExpandFields` saw no fields, and the query went out with no `$expand`
 * at all. Nothing re-ran the effect when the schema landed, so every
 * lookup / master_detail / user / tree field of a standalone `object-calendar`
 * rendered from its raw foreign-key id, forever.
 *
 * Only the STANDALONE calendar reaches this path. One hosted by `ObjectView` or
 * `ListView` receives its rows as `data` and never fetches — objectui#6419
 * already covers that composition (and the last test here pins that the gate
 * did not turn a hosted calendar into a fetching one).
 *
 * ## Why gating, measured on THIS component
 *
 * objectui#6271 (kanban) and objectui#6419 (view) settled the same trade, but
 * this effect's dependency set is different again (`dataConfig`,
 * `hasInlineData`, `schema.filter`, `schema.sort`, `refreshKey`), so what an
 * extra re-run costs HERE was measured separately. Instrumented adapter, rows
 * carrying a `_from` tag, three latency profiles, observations read from the
 * DOM and from real child commits:
 *
 *   before             1 find, `$expand` NEVER present, in all three profiles.
 *                      The calendar paints raw ids and keeps them.
 *   `objectSchema`     2 finds, `[no-expand, $expand:[…]]`. Visible cost varies
 *   added to the deps  with which read is slower:
 *                        schema slower  raw ids paint at 30ms, the calendar
 *                                       reverts to "Loading calendar..." at
 *                                       71ms, expanded rows land at 94ms — a
 *                                       THREE-step paint.
 *                        equal          raw commits, but coalesces with the
 *                                       loading commit — a coin flip.
 *                        schema faster  the first response is discarded on
 *                                       arrival; a round trip bought and
 *                                       thrown away.
 *   gated (this file)  1 find, carrying `$expand` the first time, in all three
 *                      profiles. One delivery, expanded, at 107/88/78ms versus
 *                      108/94/79ms for the dependency version — the correct
 *                      rows land at the same wall clock, with half the queries
 *                      and nothing wrong painted in between.
 *
 * The three-step paint is this component's own finding: `loading` is an early
 * return that replaces the whole grid, and the re-run calls `setLoading(true)`,
 * so the calendar does not merely swap ids for names the way `ObjectView` does
 * — it drops back to its placeholder first.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ What "gated" must mean — the trap this file exists to hold shut
 *
 * The gate is on the schema read having **settled**, NOT on `objectSchema`
 * being truthy. Those differ for exactly the calendars least able to report it:
 * an adapter exposing no `getObjectSchema`, and a read that throws. Under a
 * truthy-value gate both wait forever and the calendar renders its spinner with
 * no error and no request.
 *
 * ## Which pins discriminate, measured against the base commit
 *
 * Reverse-verified by restoring this component to the commit this branch left:
 * SIX of the nine go red (the four above, plus the REJECTS pin and the object
 * switch), THREE stay green in both directions. Stated so nobody mistakes a
 * standing green for coverage:
 *
 *   - "no `getObjectSchema`" is green before and after — `origin/main` has no
 *     gate at all, so it queries here anyway. It guards a FUTURE wrong shape:
 *     it is the test that goes red the moment anyone "simplifies" the gate to
 *     `if (!objectSchema) return;`.
 *   - the REJECTS pin looks like the same class but is NOT: its ordering
 *     assertion is discriminating, and against the base it reads
 *     `['find', 'schema:issued']` — the query went out before the schema was
 *     even requested. It is a truthy-gate pin AND a red one.
 *   - the inline-`value` and hosted-parent tests are green in both directions
 *     by construction: they are the controls proving this change did not turn
 *     either composition into a fetching one, and that the gate — scoped to the
 *     `object` provider because a `value` provider issues no metadata read —
 *     does not hold a query open on a resolution nothing was going to produce.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Ghost-assertion guard
 *
 * A query count, or an `$expand` presence check, would ALSO pass if the
 * calendar stopped fetching altogether. So: every count is reached only after
 * waiting for a real call; the first test's `waitFor` targets the EXPANDED call
 * specifically, so zero fetches times out rather than reading as success;
 * `$expand` is asserted against the expandable fields DERIVED FROM THE FIXTURE
 * through core's own `EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES`, in both directions; and the
 * delivery test asserts rows actually reach `CalendarView` rather than the
 * query merely being counted.
