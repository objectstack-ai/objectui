 * "What will publishing change?" — the draft changeset, answered before the
 * user commits. Lists every pending ADR-0033 draft grouped by metadata type,
 * and classifies each as NEW (no published version exists — publishing adds
 * it) or UPDATE (a published version exists — publishing overwrites it).
 * Each entry expands into a field-level diff (objects) / changed-key summary
 * (everything else), lazily fetched on first expand. This is the review
 * surface that turns Publish from a leap of faith into an informed click.
 *
 * Read-only by default: fetches `_drafts` + published lists on open, and
 * never writes. When the caller passes `onPublish`, the panel additionally
 * renders a confirm footer — review-then-publish in one surface — but the
 * publish action itself still belongs to the caller.

// The `/meta` URL-spelling fold (objectstack#7894, objectstack-ai/objectstack#8424), applied once in
// `listPendingDrafts` below.
//
// CORRECTED, and the correction matters more than the number. An earlier
// version of this comment stated that this import puts `@objectstack/spec/shared`
// on the console's EAGER graph, at +213.4 KB minified / +60.1 KB gzipped. The
// attribution is false: that cost was never this import's. Measured by ablation
// on `origin/main` at 0fce2ef81 (2026-08-24) — delete this import, rebuild
// `apps/console`, read the `eagerGzipBytes` in `dist/eager-closure.json` — the
// eager closure moves +285 bytes gzipped, i.e. minifier noise. Read that figure
// as what it is, one tree on one day; the full measurement, with the
// counter-probes that discriminate it, is recorded on objectui#5359.
//
// The MECHANISM is the part that survives the next release. `/shared` is held on
// the eager graph by an edge upstream of this repo: `@objectstack/core`, shipped
// inside `@objectstack/client` and a direct dependency of `apps/console`, has a
// runtime `import { pluralToSingular } from '@objectstack/spec/shared'`. Every
// OTHER importer of `/shared` in objectui's own source is type-only and erased
// at build, so ablating this one still leaves the subpath in the eagerly loaded
// `vendor-objectstack` chunk. Deferring or deleting this import therefore moves
// ~nothing while that edge stands, and the lever lives at the producer — it is
// tracked in objectstack#11503.
//
// Still true, and still why laziness is not the local answer: each published
// spec subpath is a self-contained bundle and nothing tree-shakes it
// (`@objectstack/spec` declares no `sideEffects`), and the console's
// `vendor-objectstack` chunk group claims every `@objectstack/*` module except
// `@objectstack/lint`, that group's chunk being a static import of the app entry
// (objectui#5266). So an `await import()` here would relocate nothing either.
//
// ⛔ Do not "optimize" this into a local copy of the spelling table: a
// spec-named local declaration is what `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs`
// refuses, and a faithful copy is exactly the fork that guard exists to prevent.
