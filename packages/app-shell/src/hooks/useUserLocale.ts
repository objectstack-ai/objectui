/**
 * useUserLocale — one source of truth for a signed-in user's language
 * (objectui#10059, executing ruling batch #193 item 5 letter C on
 * objectui#10051).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * One word 「语言」 named two settings. The profile page's language card writes
 * the server column `sys_user.locale` (the column objectstack#14787 made
 * writable, first written by objectui#7501); the globe menu switched a
 * device-local UI language held in `@object-ui/i18n`'s `localStorage` slot.
 * Neither writer could see the other, so a user who set 日本語 on their profile
 * kept reading an English console and nothing said why.
 *
 * ## What decides now, and why the divergence cannot come back
 *
 * For a signed-in user `sys_user.locale` is the ONLY decider, and that is a
 * property of the wiring rather than of anyone's discipline:
 *
 *   - **One writer path.** Both controls write the same column through the same
 *     adapter — the profile card already did, and {@link useLanguageSelection}
 *     now makes the globe do it too. There is no second place to write.
 *   - **One reader, on the invalidation bus.** {@link useSignedInUserLocale} is
 *     mounted once in the console shell. It reads the column on mount and again
 *     on every `sys_user` mutation the data-invalidation bus reports — which
 *     includes the profile card's own save, because every adapter write reaches
 *     that bus through `useMutationInvalidationBridge`. So changing the
 *     language in either place changes it in both, in the same session, with no
 *     reload.
 *   - **The device slot is demoted to a cache, not removed and not ignored.**
 *     `@object-ui/i18n` still persists the active language per device, and that
 *     value still decides before sign-in and for the first paint of a boot. It
 *     can no longer outlive a signed-in read: the reader above overwrites it
 *     with the column on every mount. A stale device value therefore has a
 *     bounded life (one row read), never a session and never a device.
 *
 * ⚠️ The residue this does NOT close, stated rather than left to be discovered:
 * the first paint of a boot renders from the device cache, because the column
 * can only be read after the adapter exists. A value changed on another device
 * shows for the length of one round trip and is then replaced. That is the same
 * stale-while-revalidate posture the locale seed already ships with, and it is
 * the reason the cache is kept rather than cleared.
 *
 * ## Change of owner (objectui#10193)
 *
 * The device cache above belongs to whoever last signed in on this browser.
 * When the session resolves to someone ELSE, `@object-ui/auth` purges it and
 * {@link useSignedInUserLocale} re-resolves the live language before the new
 * owner's column applies — see `useLanguageResetOnOwnerChange` below. Without
 * that, a new owner with no column of their own kept the previous owner's
 * language for the whole session.
 *
 * ## Signed out
 *
 * Nothing here applies: with no `sys_user` row there is nothing to read and
 * nothing to write. {@link useLanguageSelection} performs the local switch and
 * returns, so language selection for a visitor is exactly what it was.

/**
 * Re-resolve the UI language when this browser changes hands (objectui#10193,
 * ruling B).
 *
 * ## The leak this closes
 *
 * A boot resolves its language BEFORE anyone is signed in, out of two device
 * slots: the explicit choice (`LOCALE_STORAGE_KEY`, since objectui#10059 a
 * cache of the signed-in user's `sys_user.locale`) and the seed
 * (`LOCALE_SEED_STORAGE_KEY`, the server's resolved locale for the last
 * caller). Both hold the PREVIOUS owner's language on a browser that changed
 * hands. When the session then resolves to someone else,
 * `@object-ui/auth`'s `SessionUserScope.adopt` purges those slots
 * (objectui#5664) — but the live i18next language was already derived from
 * them and is memory, not storage. Nothing re-derived it, and for a new owner
 * with no column of their own {@link useSignedInUserLocale} applies nothing,
 * so they read the previous owner's language for the whole session. A boot
 * whose cookie session already belongs to the new owner (an SSO redirect, a
 * sign-in in another window) is exactly that boot.
 *
 * ## What this does
 *
 * On each owner change it re-resolves the language exactly as a boot of the
 * swept storage would ({@link resolveBootstrapLanguage}: now no explicit
 * choice and no seed, so the browser language, then `en`) and switches to it.
 * The switch persists itself through the provider's `languageChanged` choke
 * point like every switch does, so the explicit slot is cleared again right
 * after — the reset is not a choice anyone made, and leaving it stored would
 * outrank the new owner's own seed on every boot from then on. The column, if
 * the new owner has one, then applies as it always has: the read below is
 * re-run for the owner change, and its apply is queued behind this reset.
 *
 * ⚠️ The resolution cannot see the host's `I18nProvider` `config`; it resolves
 * as a host passing none does, which is what the console passes.
 *
 * Returns the owner-change count, so the column read can key on it.
