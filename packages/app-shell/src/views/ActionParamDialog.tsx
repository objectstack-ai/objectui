/**
 * ActionParamDialog — Collects user input for action parameters before execution.
 *
 * Renders each `ActionParamDef` through the SAME field-widget renderer the
 * object form uses (`@object-ui/fields` — `fieldWidgetMap` via
 * `getLazyFieldWidget`), so a declared action param of any form-supported
 * field type (`select`, `lookup`, `file`, `image`, `richtext`, `color`,
 * `date`, …) renders its real widget instead of collapsing to a text input
 * (ADR-0059). The param → field translation lives in the pure
 * `paramToField()` adapter; widgets stay lazy behind `<Suspense>` so opening
 * a dialog only loads the widgets its params actually use.
 *
 * Ambient context is relied on, not threaded: `UploadProvider` (file/image
 * uploads) and `SchemaRendererContext` (dataSource for lookup/user pickers)
 * come from the host view, exactly as the previous `LookupField` reuse did.
 *
 * One thing is threaded rather than ambient, and deliberately so: the live
 * record a dependent widget scopes itself by. The dialog is a small form, so
 * its own in-progress `values` are that record — for WHICH widgets receive it
 * and on which of the two independent grounds, see
 * `paramNeedsDependentValues()` below (objectui#3765 for the option widgets,
 * objectui#8672 ruling A for the reference-bearing pickers).
 *
 * Returns collected param values or null on cancel.

 * Filter action params by their optional `visible` predicate, evaluated on the
 * canonical entry (`evalRowPredicate`) against the host predicate scope
 * (features / user / app / data). Pure + exported so the gating is unit-testable
 * without the dialog render tree.
 *
 * ## Fail-open, and LOUD (objectui#4640)
 *
 * A param whose `visible` cannot be evaluated — unparseable source, unbound
 * identifier, a key the scope does not carry — is SHOWN, and says so once, with
 * the action and param named and the predicate quoted. Both halves are ruled,
 * not chosen here:
 *
 *  - **Loud** is the standing 2026-08-06 ruling on objectui#4051 /
 *    objectstack#5149: fail-open or fail-closed may be chosen, *silent may not*.
 *    This function used to be silent in three of the four fault shapes — the
 *    bare `catch { return true }` below the old `evaluateCondition` call swallowed
 *    parse errors and unbound identifiers without a word, so a broken predicate
 *    was indistinguishable from an absent one.
 *  - **Open** is the direction ruled for THIS surface: a silently dropped param
 *    is the undiagnosable failure — the dialog never collects a value the server
 *    requires, and the action then fails at submit with nothing pointing at the
 *    predicate. An extra offered field fails the other way, with a server
 *    rejection that carries a message. Two harms; the self-diagnosing one wins.
 *    (Row surfaces rule the opposite way — a faulting row-action `visible` stays
 *    hidden — because there the harm is acting on records the predicate excluded.)
 *
 * ## One value, one answer (objectui#3314)
 *
 * The old implementation's fail DIRECTION was decided by the predicate's
 * DIALECT, not by this surface: a bare string ran the legacy JS evaluator
 * (lenient → falsy → param silently DROPPED) while a `{ dialect, source }`
 * envelope ran CEL (fault → param silently KEPT). One `visible` key, two
 * opposite outcomes, chosen by whether the authored text happened to contain
 * `${…}` / `===`. That fork is deleted, not braced: every spelling now reaches
 * one entry, one fail direction and one warning. (`evalRowPredicate` still
 * routes a legacy-dialect STRING to the old engine for back-compat — with its
 * own deprecation warning naming the predicate — but the fault direction is the
 * same on both of its paths, so the surface no longer has two answers.)
 *
 * ## No row here — the scope keeps its own `data` / `record`
 *
 * `evalRowPredicate`'s subject is a row, and it pins `record` / `data` to it
 * over the host scope (objectui#3796). This surface has no row: its scope IS the
 * host predicate scope, `data` and all. So it passes `rowless: true`, which
 * binds nothing over the scope — an author's `data.*` / `record.*` param
 * predicate keeps reading the host's values instead of faulting on an empty
 * object written over them.
 *
 * @param actionLabel The action's own label, so the fault warning names the
 *                    action as well as the param. Optional — the param name
 *                    alone is still a locator.

/**
 * Serialize collected values for the request body. Upload widgets (`file` /
 * `image`) may hold a bare `sys_file` id — the reference form they now submit
 * when the adapter surfaces one — or a rich `{ file_id, name, url, … }` object,
 * or an array of either when `multiple`. The portable API contract is the
 * storage id(s), so each upload param is reduced to its id via `fileIdOf`, the
 * same extractor the field widgets use, so the two surfaces cannot drift on
 * what counts as an id. An object carrying no id is left intact, so the failure
 * is visible rather than silently POSTing `undefined`. Every non-upload value is
 * returned as-is. Pure + exported so the mapping is unit-testable without the
 * dialog render tree.
 *
 * `datetime` params pass through here untouched, and that is the fix for
 * objectstack#5061 — the previous version of this function converted them back
 * to the control's zone-less local wall clock (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`), which is
 * the one shape the platform's `datetime` value contract REJECTS. Since 17.0
 * the dispatcher validates a params bag against the action's declaration before
 * the handler runs (ADR-0104 D2, `validateActionParams` →
 * `InstantValueSchema`), and that contract is an ISO-8601 instant with an
 * explicit zone. A zone-less wall clock earned a 400 on every UI submission, so
 * no value a user could pick could pass: the renderer and the validator wanted
 * disjoint shapes.
 *
 * No conversion is needed at this boundary, because `DateTimeField` is already
 * ISO-canonical on both sides (objectui#3127/#3565): it takes the record's ISO
 * instant in, and hands an ISO instant back out — seconds and milliseconds
 * included, zone explicit. #3565 added the back-conversion to keep the wire
 * shape byte-identical while it fixed a display bug, and said so: moving action
 * params onto ISO is a contract change of its own. objectstack#5061 is that
 * change, and it only removes the conversion — every param value the dialog can
 * hold is already zoned (widget output, or a `defaultFromRow` seed read from a
 * stored instant). Deliberately NOT normalized here: an authored
 * `defaultValue` written as a zone-less wall clock. That value is ambiguous
 * metadata (whose zone?), the spec types it `unknown` so nothing rejects it at
 * authoring time yet, and coercing it in the renderer would make it "work" in
 * the UI while the identical literal still 400s from REST/MCP — the worst split
 * to debug. It stays loud until the spec validates a param default against the
 * param's own value contract (objectstack#6970).

 * Which widgets in this dialog are handed the dialog's live record as
 * `dependentValues` — and the reason is not one rule but TWO, over overlapping
 * families, exactly as the object form already splits them
 * (`form.tsx`'s `needsDataSourceWiring` line beside its
 * `CASCADE_OPTION_WIDGET_TYPES` line).
 *
 * 1. **Option widgets** — {@link CASCADE_OPTION_WIDGET_TYPES}. Their OFFERED
 *    SET is re-resolved against the record (`visibleWhen`, `dependsOn` gating)
 *    by the shared evaluator. This half has been supplied since objectui#3765.
 * 2. **Reference-bearing pickers** — {@link EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES}. They have
 *    no options list to narrow; they narrow a QUERY. `LookupField` turns the
 *    field's declared `dependsOn` into a hard `$filter` (`dependentFilter` →
 *    `popoverFilter` / `baseFilter`, feeding the quick-select popover, the
 *    Level-2 table picker and PeoplePicker alike) and gates the trigger while
 *    a named parent is still empty. objectui#8672, ruling A — the maintainer's
 *    decision batch #115 — wires this half up here.
 *
 * ⭐ **Why this is not `CASCADE_OPTION_WIDGET_TYPES.add('lookup')`.** That set
 * is shared verbatim by the object form and `plugin-grid`'s `BulkActionDialog`,
 * and its members mean one specific thing: "this widget's offered OPTION set is
 * re-resolved by `resolveCascadingOptions`". A lookup's is not — it has no
 * option set. Adding a member would silently change the form's cascade-CLEAR
 * loop and the bulk dialog too, deciding objectui#4771's open boundary for two
 * surfaces this card never measured. So the families stay separate and this
 * surface ORs them, which is the extension shape `paramToField.ts` names and
 * the form has shipped all along. ⛔ Never `new Set([...A, ...B])` — a copy
 * re-forks a shared table.
 *
 * ⚠️ `EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES` is read over WIDGET keys here (the output of
 * `paramToField`, i.e. `resolveParamWidgetType`), the same coincidence the form
 * documents: each reference type maps onto a same-named widget id. `tree`
 * resolves to `lookup` before it reaches this test, so that member is inert
 * here — as it is on the form. A picker that degraded to `text` for want of a
 * declared target is a `text` widget by then, and correctly gets nothing.
