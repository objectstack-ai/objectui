/**
 * GEOMETRY pin for the record-header title/action width arbitration on the two
 * headers objectui#7281 covers — `packages/plugin-detail/src/DetailView.tsx`
 * and `packages/layout/src/PageHeader.tsx`. Sibling of
 * `packages/components/src/__tests__/page-header-title-width.test.tsx`, which
 * pins objectui#7244's fix on `page:header`.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE IS A PLAYWRIGHT SPEC AND NOT A VITEST TEST. jsdom and
 * happy-dom have no layout engine — every `getBoundingClientRect()` there is
 * 0x0 and `clientWidth` is 0 — so the sibling pin had to settle for
 * CLASS-SHAPE assertions, and a class-shape assertion passes against a floor
 * that does nothing. This file asserts the widths themselves, in Chromium,
 * which is the only place the arbitration actually happens.
 *
 * ## What is real here and what is a fixture
 *
 * REAL, read out of the source files at run time: the header row's class
 * string, the title column's class string, the action tail's class string and
 * the h1's class string, for both headers — plus real Tailwind, compiled from
 * the installed `tailwindcss` for exactly those candidates. Delete
 * `sm:min-w-64` from DetailView or `min-w-48` from PageHeader and the string
 * this file measures changes with it.
 *
 * FIXTURE: the action tail's CONTENT is three or four fixed-width boxes rather
 * than real `<Button>`s, so the tail's width is a constant instead of a
 * font-metric. The element tree around them is transcribed from the two
 * sources.
 *
 * ## Calibration against the running app (Chromium, console dev server,
 * `type: 'detail'` and `<PageHeader actions={…}>`, three labelled
 * `record_header` actions, viewport 799px, objectui#7281):
 *
 *   DetailView  before: h1  6.17px of a 218px scrollWidth, tail 724.83px
 *               after:  h1 218.39px, tail wrapped to its own line
 *   PageHeader  before: h1 170.59px of a 265px scrollWidth, tail 564.41px
 *               after:  h1 751.00px, tail wrapped to its own line
 *
 * The fixture tails below (722px / 592px) are sized to that measured
 * neighbourhood, so the geometry this file reproduces is the geometry the app
 * produces, not a worst case invented to make a floor look necessary.

 *
 *   a child's WIDTH is its CROSS size in a column container, and

 * three utilities that look like they should have stopped it cannot: `min-w-0`
 * is a floor rather than a ceiling, `flex-1` acts on the main axis (height
 * here), and the h1's `truncate` never fires because its containing block had
 * been sized to the text.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS IS HERE AND NOT IN A VITEST FILE — the same reason the header
 * above is: this is a LAYOUT fact. jsdom and happy-dom have no layout engine,
 * so an assertion on these widths there would be vacuous and green. And a
 * CLASS-SHAPE pin would be worse than useless on this particular defect: the
