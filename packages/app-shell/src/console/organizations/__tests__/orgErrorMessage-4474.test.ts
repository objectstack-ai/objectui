/**
 * objectui#4474 family 2 — the code -> message mapping, unit level.
 *
 * ## Why a `code` and never the text
 *
 * The three server-echoed sites the card measured render better-auth's English
 * `message` verbatim. Translating that by matching the English string would bind
 * the console to a third party's copy-editing: better-auth is free to reword
 * "Organization already exists" in any release, and a string match would go
 * silently English again with nothing red. The `code` is the stable half of the
 * pair — `ORGANIZATION_ALREADY_EXISTS` is the identifier, the sentence is its
 * rendering — so the mapping is keyed by the code and the text is never read.
 *
 * ## Prefer mapped, degrade to verbatim
 *
 * The shape is the repo's existing one, not a new invention: `LoginForm` and
 * `RegisterForm` already resolve `(code && map[code]) || error.message`. An
 * unmapped code must still show the server's own sentence — English beats a
 * blank box or a generic "something went wrong", both of which destroy the only
 * information the user has. Both directions are pinned below, because only one
 * of them is the interesting failure: a mapping that swallows unknown codes
 * passes every "known code" test there is.
 *
 * ## Codes covered, and why exactly these
 *
 * Each entry is a rejection the five console files can actually provoke — not a
 * mirror of better-auth's 60-code table. Speculative rows would be ten pack
 * translations apiece for a screen that cannot reach them, and an uncovered code
 * already degrades correctly, so the cost of NOT listing one is bounded.
