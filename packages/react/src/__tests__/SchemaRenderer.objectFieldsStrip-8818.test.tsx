 * objectui#8818 — an AUTHORED `objectFields` never reaches a component prop.
 *
 * ## The ruling this pins
 *
 * Decision batch #70 (objectui#7742, PR objectui#8799) ruled that `objectFields`
 * — the object's field catalogue, which the predicate layer reads to decide how
 * a conditional-formatting rule compares a relation field — is a RUNTIME React
 * prop a host injects, never authorable metadata. That PR moved the key off the
 * `kanban` arm's `schema` bag, but the renderer's fixed metadata strip list did
 * not name it, so a node that authored `objectFields` still had it spread as a
 * React prop onto whatever component its type resolved to. The class-one
 * ruling on objectui#8818 (letter a, ratified) completes batch #70: the key
 * joins the strip list, so no authored value can take the prop seat.
 *
 * ## Three spellings, one instrument
 *
 * An author can put a key on a node three ways, and every one of them reached
 * the spread before this card:
 *
 *   - top level — `{ type, objectFields }` — spread through `componentProps`;
 *   - canonical `properties: { objectFields }` — hoisted onto the node by the
 *     evaluation memo, then spread through `componentProps`;
 *   - legacy `props: { objectFields }` — NOT hoisted; spread as its own bag
 *     after `componentProps`, so the destructure alone does not cover it (the
 *     carrier objectui#9758 found one key over, for `data`).
 *
 * Each row drives all three through the same probe and asserts them as one
 * labelled object, so a failure names the spelling that moved.
 *
 * ## The controls that make a zero a reading
 *
 * An absence on a probe that silently stopped capturing reads identically to a
 * strip that works. So every absence row is paired with a lit leg on the SAME
 * probe: a sibling key authored the same three ways still arrives (row 2), and
 * a HOST-passed `objectFields` React prop still arrives (rows 3 and 4) — that is
 * the only legitimate producer's channel, and `...props` is spread last.
 *
 * ## Why a stub and not the kanban board
 *
 * The question this file owns is what `SchemaRenderer` HANDS OVER, for any
 * type key. No registered renderer reads `objectFields` today (the census on
 * objectui#8818's PR); the board that does is mounted by `ObjectKanban` as a
 * host with the prop passed directly, and its behavioural pin lives in
 * `plugin-kanban`. The plugins are not importable here — they depend on this
 * package.
