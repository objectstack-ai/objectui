 *     rebuild, which is the same misread this page would make.
 *   - **`_packageId === 'sys_metadata'`** is the sentinel for an overlay bound
 *     to no package at all — runtime-authored, never packaged.
 *   - **`_provenance`** is the axis that actually separates the two (ADR-0010:
 *     `'package'` for loader-introduced items, `'org'` for tenant-authored).
 *

 * on that page offers an install-wide switch for something Studio owns, and a
