/**
 * objectui#5687 — a node-gate `data.*` predicate the adapter cannot answer is
 * LOUD, and nothing else moves.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-22, option A: the node tier keeps its documented
 * `data` = adapter semantics. No verdict changes, no interpolation changes —
 * objectui#5330's row binding does NOT extend to this tier. Instead the
 * objectui#5454 reporter posture is extended to this NON-throwing path, so an
 * author sees the constant-false instead of shipping it.
 *
 * ## The pin is a TRIPLE, not a pair
 *
 * Two of the three cases here are negatives, and they are the half that keeps
 * the report honest:
 *
 *   1. the card's reproduction shape (`properties: { visible: "data.status ==
 *      'draft'" }`) reports — and still hides, on every row;
 *   2. a canonical `record.*` predicate stays SILENT;
 *   3. a genuine adapter read (`${data.total}` against an adapter that HAS
 *      `total`) stays SILENT.
 *
 * Drop any one and the file is green on an implementation that reports
 * everything, or nothing.
 *
 * ## The control that decides WHICH discriminator is implemented
 *
 * "Reports the repro" is satisfied by three mutually incompatible triggers.
 * `same predicate text, adapter ANSWERS it` (group 2c) is what separates them:
 * it holds the predicate source and the `false` verdict fixed and moves only
 * whether the adapter has the key. A "references `data.`" trigger fails it; a
 * "the predicate is constant-false" trigger fails it; only "a `data.*` read the
 * bound object does not answer" passes it.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted before running)
 *
 * Deleting the `reportAdapterOnlyDataPredicate` call in `SchemaRenderer`'s
 * `evaluateVisibilityPredicate` turns RED exactly the four positive cases in
 * group 1 and the dedupe case, and leaves every silence case and every verdict
 * assertion green — that asymmetry IS leg-3-of-#5454's property, restated: the
 * change moves the silence, not the answer. Removing the `unresolved.length`
 * guard instead turns RED the silence cases (2a/2b/2c/3a/3b) while group 1 stays
 * green, which is the false-positive direction the ruling refuses.
 *
 * ## objectui#9308 — WHICH object `data` names moved; the triple did not
 *
 * The 2026-08-22 ruling above said the node tier "keeps its documented
 * `data` = adapter semantics". The 2026-09-13 ruling on objectui#9308 retired
 * exactly that: the renderer binds no `data` root, and the only `data` at this
 * tier is one a HOST published through `PredicateScopeProvider`. The three
 * cases this docblock names are unchanged in SHAPE — repro reports, `record.*`
 * stays silent, an answered read stays silent — but the object that answers,
 * and the object the diagnostic resolves against, is now that host `data`.
 * `ADAPTER` is still injected on every mount and is inert; group 2c is what
 * keeps the re-aim honest, because it moves a key the adapter never has.
 *
 * The population with NO `data` anywhere — the real app-shell shape — does not
 * reach this file's diagnostic at all: the predicate throws `data is not
 * defined` and objectui#5454's reporter takes it. That leg, and the verdict
 * move it carries, is pinned in `SchemaRenderer.dataRootUnbound-9308.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## objectui#5756 — the KNOWN LIMIT below is now FIXED, not pinned as a gap
 *
 * The 2026-08-22 "no interpolation changes" ruling quoted above was **this
 * card's own scope constraint**, not a standing ban — objectui#5756 is the
 * deliberate carrier for the `${…}`-inside-`properties` surface it fenced off.
 * The test immediately below used to assert ZERO reports for that spelling;
 * it now asserts ONE, and its describe-group comment is updated to match. What
 * still stands, unchanged by #5756: no verdict changed (see `#5756 group 5`
 * below for the byte-identical-verdict control), and every OTHER case in this
 * file — the two negatives this docblock names, the record.* bucket, the
 * production build — stays exactly as pinned here.
