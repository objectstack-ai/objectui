    // ── `X-Tenant-ID` — the edge routing contract (objectui#5279) ────────
    //
    // WHAT IT MEANS. A routing hint for the hosting edge: "this request belongs
    // to tenant <id>". The value is the better-auth `activeOrganizationId` the
    // session already carries. It is NOT an identity claim, NOT an
    // authorization input, and NOT what scopes rows.
    //
    // DO NOT DELETE THIS ON THE STRENGTH OF A GREP. The framework
    // (`objectstack`) does not read it: `resolveAuthzContext` takes `tenantId`
    // from the API-key principal or `session.activeOrganizationId` and never
    // from a header, and environment routing reads the hostname and
    // `X-Environment-Id`. So a search confined to this repo plus the framework
    // finds zero consumers and reads as "dead stamp" — which is the false
    // premise objectui#5279 was filed on. The consumer is in the CLOUD repo,
    // which neither checkout contains: `service-tenant`'s `tenant-context.ts`
    // resolves the header, and `tenant-router`'s `turso-multi-tenant.zod.ts`
    // configures that resolution. The configuration contract IS readable from
    // here — `TenantRoutingConfigSchema` in `@objectstack/spec/cloud` defaults
    // `tenantHeaderName` to `X-Tenant-ID` and ranks `header` SECOND of six
    // identification sources, behind `subdomain`.
    //
    // THE UNSTAMPED-FIRST-REQUEST GAP. `ActiveOrganizationStorage` is filled
    // only after AuthProvider's async organization chain resolves, so early
    // requests go out with the header ABSENT — never present-and-empty. A
    // reader must fall through to its next identification source rather than
    // fail closed. Nothing about row visibility rides on this: the framework
    // scopes from the session, so a response computed inside the window is
    // still computed for the right tenant.
    //
    // Not gated on `isApiCall`, unlike `Authorization` and `Accept-Language`
    // above — recorded as the behaviour that ships, not endorsed; the
    // asymmetry is reported on objectui#5279 for triage to route. A wrapper
    // built with `sameOriginOnly` short-circuits every cross-origin request
    // before this line.

    // switcher, so reading it here means a language switch carries the new
    // `Accept-Language` on every subsequent request — closing the gap where
    // server-resolved labels stayed in the old language until a page refresh

    // ## Why this lane needs it too (objectui#4467)
    //
    // The console injects the same localStorage bearer from two places: the
    // AUTH lane (sign-in / get-session / the auth endpoints) and THIS one — the
    // adapter, `provider: 'api'` data sources, and every metadata `type: 'api'`
    // action (`useConsoleActionRuntime`'s `apiHandler`). better-auth's
    // server-side bearer plugin hands a rotated session token back in
    // `set-auth-token` on whichever lane the call arrived over. Only the auth
    // lane read it, so a rotation issued to a data-lane call was dropped on the
    // floor and the browser kept sending the OLD token.
    //
    // Impersonation is exactly that call: `POST /auth/admin/impersonate-user`
    // runs as an ordinary metadata action, so the impersonated session token
    // arrived here and was discarded — while the server's bearer plugin kept
    // overwriting the impersonation cookie with the admin bearer we kept
    // sending. Impersonation was a complete no-op in the console, not merely an
    // invisible one.
    //
    // The rule is the server's declared contract and carries no knowledge of
    // which endpoint rotated: one contract, one answer, on both lanes. Gated on
    // `isApiCall` — the same condition that decided we authenticated this
    // request at all — so a response we never sent the bearer to cannot rotate
    // the session. Untrusted targets are the `sameOriginOnly` option's job (it
    // short-circuits above, before any header work).
