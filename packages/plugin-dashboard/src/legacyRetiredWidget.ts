/**
 * ONE legacy detector and ONE placeholder, shared by every dashboard surface
 * (objectui#4612).
 *
 * framework#3320 retired the pre-ADR-0021 inline-analytics binding — a widget
 * carrying top-level `object` + `categoryField` / `valueField` / `aggregate`
 * (pivot: `rowField` / `columnField`) instead of a semantic-layer `dataset`. No
 * authoring surface emits that shape anymore (`WidgetConfigPanel` actively
 * scrubs it on save via `LEGACY_ANALYTICS_KEYS`), so any widget still carrying
 * it is stale STORED metadata — and stored metadata is exactly what a renderer
 * cannot refuse to receive.
 *
 * The retirement therefore came with a graceful fallback: render a VISIBLE error
 * placeholder naming the fix, never a blank widget. That fallback was applied to
 * `DashboardRenderer` and to nothing else, while `DashboardGridLayout` — a
 * separately exported surface, then also registered as the `dashboard-grid` SDUI
 * component (retired by objectui#10859 batch 8) — kept falling through to its static-data branch with `data: []`. Same stored
 * metadata, same product: a rebind prompt on one surface and a silent blank
 * chart on the other, which is worse for the user than the pre-retirement state
 * (no chart, no diagnostic, no path to fix).
 *
 * The defect existed *because* there were two surfaces and one fix, so the cure
 * is not a second copy of the condition: both surfaces consume this module.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT match
 *
 * `options.data = { provider: 'object', object, aggregate }` is a DIFFERENT and
 * still-LIVE authoring surface — the async data-provider config, which carries
 * its OWN nested `object`/`aggregate`. Every read of it is on `widgetData`, not
 * on the widget top level (`DashboardRenderer.tsx` / `DashboardGridLayout.tsx`,
 * the `isObjectProvider` branches). Conflating the two would retire a working
 * feature, so the detector requires the absence of any widget-level data before
 * it looks at `object` at all — the same order `DashboardRenderer` has always
 * used.
 */

 * has to say what to do next — a placeholder that only signals "something is

 * True when all three hold, in this order:
 *
 * 1. no `dataset` — a dataset-bound widget is the CURRENT shape and renders
 *    through the governed `queryDataset` path;
 * 2. no renderer-internal data — neither `widget.data` nor `options.data`, which
 *    covers both the static inline array and the live `provider: 'object'`
 *    nested config;
 * 3. a top-level `object` — the retired binding itself.
 *
 * `||` (not `??`) between the two data spellings, preserving `DashboardRenderer`
 * byte for byte.
 *
 * Step 1 is stated here rather than inherited from a caller's render fork:
 * `DashboardRenderer` never reached the placeholder for a dataset-bound widget
 * because `datasetBound` picks `DatasetWidget` at the render site regardless of
 * what `getComponentSchema` returned — so naming the condition costs that
 * surface no observable behavior, and it keeps the predicate true on its own
 * terms for any surface that has no such fork.
