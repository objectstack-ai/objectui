 * measured cost of that filter (objectui#5899's census, PR #6284, re-taken on
 * the implementing commit): 25 module-local declarations under spec export
 * names, of which the four different-concept collisions got reasoned ALLOW
 * entries and 15 findings under 14 names went to the DEBT ledger.
 *
 * Dropping it is only safe because two structural narrowings landed with it, and
 * a narrowing is a statement about what this guard may NOT see. These cases are
 * that statement's proof — one red per widening, and one green per narrowing,
 * with the RED case for each narrowing's near neighbour sitting beside it.
 *
 * No fixture below re-exports its declaration, and that is still deliberate: a
 * bare `export { X }` is now resolved against the file's own imports
 * (objectui#7275), so re-exporting here would measure THAT rule rather than
 * these narrowings. Its own discrimination proof is the describe block below
 * this one. The asymmetry this comment used to record — a barrel line keeping
 * `@object-ui/plugin-list:ListView`'s ALLOW entry alive while its two renderer
 * siblings' entries were deleted — is gone with the hole: all three names are
 * now judged structurally and none of them has an entry.
 *
 * The near neighbours are the point: `rendersJsx` must not become "functions are
 * exempt" (that would have silenced `isContextToken` and
 * `normalizeFilterOperator`, the two module-local functions the census above
 * classified as real mirrors), and `isPureAlias` must not become "type aliases
