 * objectui#6041 — the Field Designer reads and writes the relationship target
 * under the spec's spelling `reference`, in BOTH directions.
 *
 * Surfaced by the key-level parity gate built for objectui#5761
 * (`scripts/check-designer-field-key-parity.mjs`). `ServerFieldSchema` is one
 * of that gate's two `wire` shapes: `fromDesignerField` builds it and this page
 * PUTs the assembled `fields` map.
 *
 * `referenceTo` is not in `FieldSchema`'s accept set — measured on the installed
 * artifact, through the whole object document:
 *
 *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ …, fields: { rel: { type: 'lookup', label: 'Owner',
 *                                               referenceTo: 'user' } } })
 *     => success = false
 *     => unrecognized_keys at ["fields","rel"] keys=["referenceTo"]
 *
 * i.e. a hard 422 `INVALID_METADATA` that blocks every later save of the object.
 *
 * Two directions, both broken by one misspelling and both pinned here:
 *
 *   WRITE — `fromDesignerField` emitted `referenceTo`, so authoring a lookup
 *           field produced the 422.
 *   READ  — `toDesignerField` read `raw.referenceTo` from the server payload.
 *           A spec-parsed server sends `reference`, so every EXISTING lookup
 *           field loaded into the designer with an empty reference box.
 *
 * Fixing only the write side would leave every already-saved field unreadable,
 * so the read case below is not a bonus assertion — it is half the card.
 *
 * Written against the wire like its siblings `MetadataFieldsPage.saveEnvelope`
 * and `MetadataFieldsPage.retiredIndexed`: a REAL `MetadataClient` over a fetch
 * double, assertions on the captured PUT bytes rather than on the argument
 * handed to the client. That distinction matters for this key — a property
 * whose value is `undefined` is a key zod's strict object COUNTS but
 * `JSON.stringify` DROPS.
 *
 * This file names no `isSystem`/`system` key anywhere, and its sibling
 * `MetadataFieldsPage.specKeySystem.test.tsx` names no reference key: the two
 * cards of this fold are independently verifiable, and reverting one fix must
 * red only its own file.
 *
 * ## objectui#7714 — a half-filled lookup is HELD CLIENT-SIDE and never PUT
 *
 * The half-filled case below used to pin the opposite ("still saves, exactly as
 * before"). `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 made `reference` a hard requirement on
 * `lookup` / `master_detail`, and objectui#7714 drove the consequence in a
 * running designer against a 17.3.0 backend: the target-less draft PUT the
 * whole object, got `422 INVALID_METADATA` at `fields.<name>.reference`, and
 * then blocked the NEXT edit too — to an entirely different, already-saved
 * field — because the draft rides along in the same document.
 *
 * This page now refuses the list and issues **no PUT at all**. The claim is
 * about THE PUT BODY, not the spec's verdict, which is why it never depended on
 * the pin in either direction — pinnable while the spec still accepted a
 * target-less draft, and pinnable now that it refuses one. ⛔ Do not re-stamp it
 * with a version when the pin next moves (objectui#8897). ⛔ Not "strip the incomplete field
 * and save the rest" — that shows the author a field the server never received,
 * the silent-drop shape objectstack#4001 closed. `puts` staying EMPTY is the
 * assertion that tells the two apart.
 *
 * ## objectui#8058 — the READ door reads BOTH spellings
 *
 * The READ line above describes what objectui#6041 left behind, and it was only
 * half repaired: `toDesignerField` moved from `raw.referenceTo` to
 * `raw.reference`, which is right for a spec-parsed server and wrong for a
 * document whose target was written by a pre-objectui#6041 build and never
 * re-saved. Such a document read as target-less, `carryOver` stripped the
 * stored key, and the field left as a `lookup` with no target at all —
 * silently at spec 17.2.0, and as an unattributed 422 against 17.3.0.
 *
 * It now reads `reference` and falls back to `referenceTo`
 * (`storedRelationshipTarget`), which is a pure rename: `FieldSchema`'s own
 * alias map renames `referenceTo` onto `reference`, and both spellings carry
 * one object machine name. The last `describe` in this file pins that, together
 * with the two controls that keep it a rename rather than a second contract —
 * objectui#7714's guard still refuses a field with no target under EITHER
 * spelling, and the spec spelling wins when both are stored and disagree.

 *   `owner_id` carries what a SPEC-PARSED SERVER sends — `reference`. That is

 *   `legacy_id` carries the misspelling a pre-fix designer build could have
 *   left behind, ALONGSIDE the spec spelling. `carryOver` spreads the previous
 *   server def verbatim, so without a tombstone the stale key rides straight
 *   back out to the route that rejects it — and the object stays blocked
 *   forever.
 *
 *   ⚠️ It carries BOTH keys deliberately (objectui#7714, and kept that way by

 *   MEASURES — delete it from the fixture and that assertion goes green
 *   because there is nothing left to strip — and the spec key is the one the
 *   read door must prefer, so this one field pins the precedence as well as
 *   the strip. Holding the target ONLY under the retired spelling is a
 *   different and narrower state; it has its own cases at the bottom of this

 *   shares, where it would have made all of them assert the read door instead

   *
   * It asserted `expect(true).toBe(true)`. The guard's list carries
   * `master_detail` for parity with the sibling writer, where it IS reachable
   * (`FieldMetadataPayload['type']` is an unconstrained `string`, and
   * `MetadataService.saveObject` refuses a target-less master-detail — pinned
   * in `MetadataService.specKeyReference.test.ts`). Through THIS page it was
   * unreachable: `toDesignerType` mapped every type outside
   * `DESIGNER_FIELD_TYPES` to `'text'` on the READ path, so a stored
   * `master_detail` arrived at the guard already flattened —
   *
   *   stored { type: 'master_detail', reference: 'invoice' }
   *     => designer field type "text"
   *     => WIRE { "type": "text", "label": "Parent", "reference": "invoice" }

   * — and a refusal assertion here would have been a PHANTOM: green because the
   * guard never saw a `master_detail`, not because it handled one. The case
   * existed so that when the flattening was fixed the missing coverage would be
   * visible rather than assumed. ⭐ *A check that cannot fire is
   * indistinguishable from one that passed.*
   *
   * ## What it asserts now
   *
   * objectui#8060 removed the flattening: a stored type this designer cannot
   * author is carried through verbatim and `toFieldsMap` runs the guard over
   * the carried-through entries too. So the branch FIRES on the real type, and
   * both of its outcomes are pinned below — the passing one first, because a
   * refusal pin alone cannot tell "the guard rejected it" from "the guard
   * rejects every master-detail".
   *
   * ⚠️ The refusal half is a BEHAVIOUR CHANGE, not merely restored coverage: an
   * object holding a target-less stored `master_detail` used to save from this
   * page by flattening the field to `text`, losing the relationship. It is now
   * refused by name before the PUT. `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 requires
   * `reference` on `master_detail`, so that document's PUT answers 422 anyway;
   * refusing here names the field and leaves the stored relationship intact.

/**
 * objectui#8058 — a target stored ONLY under the retired spelling is READ, and

 * ⚠️⚠️ THIS BLOCK REPLACES AN EXISTING PIN, AND THE FLIP IS THE CARD.
 *
 * objectui#7714 surfaced this state rather than sought it: its guard turned
 * every save in this file into a refusal when the shared fixture held
 * `legacy_id` that way, which is how the state became visible at all. It then
 * pinned what it had measured — `it('is refused by name, and issues no PUT')`,
 * asserting the page's error surface named `stale_id` and that `puts` stayed
 * empty — and said in the same breath that the refusal was "strictly better and
 * it is not a fix", because the author still has to re-pick a target the
 * document already held.
 *
 * That pin asserted the CONSEQUENCE of the read-side gap, not a contract worth
 * keeping. objectui#8058 closes the gap: `toDesignerField` now reads the target
 * under either spelling ({@link storedRelationshipTarget}), so this document no
 * longer arrives target-less, the guard has nothing to refuse, and the save
 * carries the relationship out under the spec spelling. The old expectation
 * cannot survive that and is not respelled — the branch it pinned is the branch
 * this card removes.
 *
 * ⛔ What did NOT change, and is asserted below rather than assumed:
 * objectui#7714's guard. A guard that stopped refusing because its subject was

/**
 * objectui#7714 - the refusal DIAGNOSES the state it found, on THIS writer too.
 *
 * The sibling block of the same name lives in
 * `packages/app-shell/src/services/MetadataService.specKeyReference.test.ts`.
 * The two assert the SAME four states deliberately: what both
 * `describeUnusableTarget` docblocks claim is specifically PARITY, so a partial
 * pin would leave that sentence false in a subtler way than no pin at all.
 *
 * ## Why this block exists - the measurement, not the intuition (objectui#8925)
 *
 * Both docblocks said the two copies "cannot drift" because each pin asserts
 * the same four states. That had never been measured on this side. Replacing
 * ONE branch of this page's `describeUnusableTarget` with a marker sentence and
 * running the whole package, on `6214db63f`, gave:
 *
 *   absent           mutated -> 19 files / 149 tests passed   UNPINNED
 *   non-string       mutated -> 19 files / 149 tests passed   UNPINNED
 *   empty            mutated -> 19 files / 149 tests passed   UNPINNED
 *   whitespace-only  mutated -> 1 failed                      pinned, but by
 *       `MetadataFieldsPage.carriedThroughReference-8896.test.tsx` and only
 *       through the words "whitespace names no object" - a card about a
 *       different subject, which is why it covered one row and no other.
 *
 * The same four mutations on the sibling writer turned its pin red every time.
 * So the parity sentence was false on three rows out of four while being read
 * as a guarantee.
 *
 * ⛔ The lesson worth carrying, because it is what made this survive: the claim
 * had been restated in THREE places - objectui#8897's card text, that card's
 * triage comment, and both docblocks - and not one of the three was a reading.
 * Repetition is not measurement. A parity claim is only worth its words when
 * the files that would go red are named and can be re-run.
 *
 * ## Why the page, and not the function
 *
 * `describeUnusableTarget` is module-private, and pinning it directly would pin
 * a string builder instead of what an author is shown. These cases drive the
 * page the way the author does - through the fire-and-forget `onFieldsChange`
 * the designer calls - and read the text back out of the page's error surface,
 * so a correct sentence that never reaches the banner cannot pass here.
