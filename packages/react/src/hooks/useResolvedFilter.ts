 * The ONE hold every data node uses to resolve its OWN authored `filter`
 * (objectui#10666). PR objectui#10656 wrote it for `list-view`
 * (`useResolvedAuthoredFilter`, local to `ListView.tsx`); PR objectui#10705
 * moved it into a module of `plugin-list` for `object-gallery`; the sweep that
 * closed objectui#10666 moved it here, beside `useFilterScope`, so the nine
 * packages whose nodes send their own filter share one copy instead of growing
 * nine. The hold, its key and its comparator moved unchanged; the one addition
 * is that a filter the resolver leaves unchanged is handed out as authored (see

/**
 * Resolve a data node's own authored `filter` ONCE, and hold the result.
 *
 * Every context token the spec defines for filters (`{current_user_id}`,
 * `{current_org_id}`, and the date macros such as `{today}`) is expanded by
 * `@object-ui/core`'s shared `resolveFilterPlaceholders`, against the session
 * scope the host provides. Pass `useFilterScope()` as `scope`:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const filterScope = useFilterScope();
 * const filter = useResolvedFilter(schema.filter, filterScope);
 * // query with `filter`, and key the fetch effect on `filter`, never on schema.filter
 * ```
 *
 * ⛔ Not a second resolver, and no fallback: a token the scope cannot resolve
 * is whatever `resolveFilterPlaceholders` makes of it (left intact, with one
 * warning naming it).
 *
 * The result is HELD against its inputs, the shape `plugin-view`'s
 * `useResolvedFilterSegments` uses. A fetch effect keys on this filter, so a
 * resolved copy minted on every render would refetch on every render; and a
 * date macro such as `{now}` resolves to a new value at every call, so
 * comparing OUTPUTS cannot stop that. The key is the authored filter, compared
 * by structure (a host that rebuilds an equal filter inline must not
 * re-query), plus the scope's three members read one by one, never the scope
 * object's identity (AGENTS.md #10). The held pair lives in state, so the
 * value handed out is always the one React committed. A structurally different
 * filter, or a changed scope member, resolves again and hands out a new value.
 *
 * A filter the resolver leaves unchanged (no token, or only tokens the scope
 * cannot resolve) is handed out as the authored value itself, not as the
 * resolver's equal copy, so a token-free filter reaches the query exactly as
 * it did before any resolution.
