/**
 * Studio — the Create app dialog must be targetable BY ACCESSIBLE NAME
 * (objectui#9231).
 *
 * ## The defect, as measured on `origin/main` before this fix
 *
 * The package workspace toolbar carries a button whose accessible name is
 * `Create app`; it opens a dialog whose own accessible name is also
 * `Create app` (its title — which is correct, a dialog is named after the
 * action that opened it). The one control inside that dialog which actually
 * creates the app was named `Create (save as draft)`.
 *
 * So every name a caller could write for "the control that creates the app"
 * was ambiguous: `Create app` resolved ONLY to openers (three of them: the
 * toolbar, the Interfaces empty state, the Interfaces rail), and the shorter
 * `Create` — the only handle the confirm control offered — matched the openers
 * too. There was no way to target the confirm control by name without also
 * matching the toolbar button.
 *
 * The cost is not cosmetic. While the dialog is open Radix marks the rest of
 * the tree `aria-hidden`, so a by-name click on `Create app` lands on the modal
 * overlay and Radix dismisses the dialog — silently, with no error and nothing
 * created. The failure only surfaces much later at the app's list route as
 * `App not available … it may still be publishing`, which blames a publish that
 * never started.
 *
 * ## What this suite pins
 *
 * Only accessible names, never `data-testid` — a testid would pin *around* the
 * very name the defect is about and would stay green while the defect persists.
 * Everything is asserted through the REAL `StudioDesignSurface` + the REAL
 * `CreateItemDialog`, so the names under test are the ones a browser, a screen
 * reader and an automation harness compute.
