// Spec 17.0.0-rc.1 gave the spec's own `NavigationItem` a real type — it is no
// longer the `z.ZodType<any>` erasure objectstack#4171 was filed about. That
// removed the ORIGINAL reason this stayed a local interface, but not the
// remaining ones (#3177 triage), and they were never caused by `any`:
//
//   1. Shape. The spec models navigation as a discriminated union of nine
//      `$strict` variants with a `superRefine` exclusivity rule; this is one
//      flat, all-optional shape. Converging is a breaking change for every
//      consumer that reads a target field without narrowing — the verdict
//      already recorded in `__tests__/navigation-spec-parity.test.ts`.
//   2. Three semantics the spec has at NEITHER tier: `visible: boolean` (the
//      spec takes only a CEL string / Expression envelope, yet
//      `menuItemToNavigationItem` below inverts legacy `AppMenuItem.hidden` into
//      a boolean), `pinned` (backs `useNavPins` + `FavoritesProvider`), and the
//      legacy `defaultOpen` spelling. Binding deletes all three from the type
//      while their implementations keep running.
//   3. CLOSED by objectui#10867: a separator carried a `label`, which the spec's
//      separator branch does not declare. `NavigationItem` is now a union whose
//      separator arm ({@link NavigationSeparatorItem}) admits exactly the
//      spec separator's keys — `type`, `id` and `order`.
//
// So the symbol stays local and the KEYS come off the spec one by one — the
// `badgeVariant` precedent (objectstack#4115), widened here to every key with a
// precise spec counterpart. That is the part of the burn-down that is safe
// today: a restated enum or payload shape can drift, and now cannot.
// `spec-derived-unions.test.ts` pins the blockers that remain, each written so
// it fails the day the spec closes it, and asserts the separator agreement in
// place of the blocker it replaced.

 * access boundary — gate the navigation ITEM or the app instead.
 *
 * Worth stating plainly, because the retirement's own rationale says an area
 * "carries no gate of its own": objectui DID gate on them —
 * `AppSchemaRenderer`'s area switcher filtered areas by `visible` and

 * area visibility is now DERIVED rather than authored: `AppSchemaRenderer`
 * hides an area from the switcher when none of its items survive the
 * item-level guards (`hasVisibleNavigationItems` in `@object-ui/layout`), so
 * the pre-17 "fully gated area disappears" UX is back without any authorable
 * area-level key.
 *
 * One key is pinned locally, for a reason that outlives a spec release:
 *
 *  - `navigation` — objectui's own {@link NavigationItem}, not the spec's.
 *    Spec 17.0.0-rc.1 gave the spec's item a real type, so this is no longer
 *    the `any` erasure objectstack#4171 was filed about — and it is still not
 *    bindable, for the reasons the module header above records
 *    (`visible: boolean`, `pinned` / `defaultOpen`; the separator `label` was
 *    closed by objectui#10867). Precision is not equivalence: this is case 2c in the guard's

   * On every other node `hidden` is the key `BaseSchema` declares:
   * `boolean | ExpressionWire`, a predicate `SchemaRenderer`'s `shouldHide`
   * chain evaluates. On the `app` node a DIFFERENT key with the same name
   * wins: `@objectstack/spec/ui` `AppSchema.hidden`, taken BY REFERENCE
   * through `SpecAppFields` in `./zod/app.zod.ts`, where the spec's fields
   * land after the base's and override them. Measured on
   * `@objectstack/spec@17.2.0` by resolving `AppSchema.shape`: `hidden` is
   * `z.boolean().optional()`, described "Hide from the App Switcher; the
   * shell surfaces hidden apps via the avatar menu instead (navigation only
   * -- never an access gate)"; the spec declares NEITHER `visible` NOR
   * `disabled` on the app node, which is why the objectui#4581 / #4580
   * widenings of those two keys reached this node and the objectui#7455
   * widening of this one did not.
   *
   * So the predicate spelling every other node accepts -- a string, or the
   * CEL envelope object -- is REFUSED on this node on both faces: measured
   * before this restatement, `AppComponentSchema.safeParse({ type: 'app',
   * hidden: 'user.role == "admin"' })` failed at path `hidden`
   * (`invalid_type`, expected boolean, received string) and so did
   * `safeValidateSchema` on the same document, while this interface still
   * inherited the base's union and INVITED exactly that spelling. This member
   * pulls the declaration back to what the validator has enforced all along
   * (direction 1 of objectui#7542); the `KnownDrift` row objectui#7455 seeded
   * for this pair left with it, because the drift did. The in-repo reader
   * agrees with the boolean: `filterActiveApps`
   * (`packages/app-shell/src/utils/appRoute.ts`) keeps an app out of the
   * launcher on `hidden !== true` and never evaluates the value, so a
   * predicate string here would have read as "not hidden" without a sound.
   *
   * The open alternative is direction 2 -- give the catalogue flag its own
   * name upstream in `@objectstack/spec` so this node can inherit the
   * renderer's predicate again. That is a protocol change with its own
   * producers and is NOT taken here; until it is, an `app` node cannot use
