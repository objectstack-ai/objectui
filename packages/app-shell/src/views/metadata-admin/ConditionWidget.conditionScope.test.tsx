/**
 * The schema-driven condition editor lints in the scope its HOST declares, and
 * the host derives that from the metadata type it is editing — objectui#8167,
 * the third and last arm of the card.
 *
 * ## The defect these cases reproduce
 *
 * `SchemaForm` routes a field to `ConditionWidget` by NAME CONVENTION
 * (`visible` / `hidden` / `disabled` / `visibleOn` / `condition` / `predicate` /
 * `*When`), so ONE widget serves every metadata type. It claimed no scope, so
 * every one of those fields fell through to `celAuthoring`'s own
 * `hint.scope ?? 'flattened'` default and a bare `status == 'done'` linted
 * CLEAN — including on the action and hook tiers, where the runtime binds the
 * row as the `record` ROOT and the predicate therefore never matches. The
 * author got a success receipt the runtime refuses.
 *
 * ## Why the verdict rides `WidgetContext` and not a prop
 *
 * `ConditionWidget` has ZERO JSX mount sites — measured, and it is the whole
 * reason for this shape. It is resolved out of a registry declared
 * `satisfies Record<string, WidgetRenderer>` where
 * `WidgetRenderer = (props: WidgetProps) => React.ReactElement`, so a
 * widget-specific required prop is a compile error at the registry and there is
 * no host mount to supply one. `WidgetContext` is the channel every host
 * already builds, and `conditionScope` is REQUIRED there, so a host that fails
 * to decide does not compile.
 *
 * ## Real engine, on purpose
 *
 * As in `inspectors/ConditionBuilder.mountScope.test.tsx`: the red leg types a
 * BARE SHORTHAND and asserts the editor rejects it, rather than asserting that
 * a value arrived. A "the member is forwarded" assertion would pass against a
 * scope the engine does not honour; this one can only pass if the engine was
 * actually asked the record-scoped question.
 *
 * ## The three arms, and the control
 *
 *  - `record`    — rejects the bare shorthand, still accepts the canonical one.
 *  - `flattened` — still accepts the bare shorthand. The tiers that are NOT row
 *                  surfaces (flow, permission / RLS) keep their vocabulary;
 *                  this is the half that stops the fix from being a sweep.
 *  - `none`      — no builder and no lint claim at all: the plain string editor.
 *  - NO context  — unchanged from before the member existed. A host that hands
 *                  down no `WidgetContext` has made no claim, and this change
 *                  does not reach it.
