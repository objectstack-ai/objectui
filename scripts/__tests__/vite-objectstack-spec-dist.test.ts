/**
 * objectui#4854 — `apps/console/vite.config.ts` honours `OBJECTSTACK_SPEC_DIST`,
 * so a framework build can bundle the console against ITS OWN `@objectstack/spec`
 * instead of the last published one (mechanism ruled on objectstack#8134).
 *
 * Two facts are pinned here, and they pull in opposite directions on purpose:
 *
 *   1. **Set → every subpath is mapped.** The client hook this mirrors is one
 *      prefix alias, which is safe only because `@objectstack/client` exports a
 *      single entry. The spec's map has 20 and redirects each into `dist/`, so a
 *      copied client line rewrites `@objectstack/spec/ui` to a path that does not
 *      exist — measured as 214 broken import sites for `/ui` alone. The
 *      reconciliation case below therefore checks the derivation against Node's
 *      OWN resolver, entry by entry, and separately sweeps every spec specifier
 *      this repository actually imports.
 *   2. **Unset → nothing moves.** Each of the four surfaces the hook can touch
 *      (`resolve.alias`, `optimizeDeps.include`, the `vendor-objectstack` chunk
 *      test, `server.fs.allow`) is pinned at its baseline value, read off the
 *      REAL console config rather than off the helper, so a hook that stopped
 *      being conditional turns these red rather than shipping a silently
 *      different production bundle.
 *
 * Reverse verification, direction predicted BEFORE running. Both plain RED — the
 * derivation is the sole input to case 1 and the `null` branch the sole input to
 * case 2, so a mutation in either can only ADD findings; neither has the
 * count-shaped or inverted direction some pins do. Predicted, then measured:
 *
 *   - **Drop one subpath** from the derived table (`… && s !==
 *     '@objectstack/spec/ui'`) → 5 red. Worth recording precisely, because the
 *     obvious expectation is wrong: the dropped specifier does NOT show up as
 *     "no alias". It falls through to the bare entry and is reported as
 *     `@objectstack/spec/ui -> …/dist/index.mjs/ui` — a path that cannot exist
 *     — so the finding lands in the repo sweep's `unresolved` list, while
 *     `missing` stays empty. The reconciliation case fails one step earlier, on
 *     19-vs-18.
 *   - **Make the hook unconditional** (default the env read to the installed
 *     spec dir) → 2 red, both in the console-config block: the alias table gains
 *     19 `@objectstack` keys, and `optimizeDeps.include` drops from 7 to 3
 *     (measured while the list still carried the two map entries that
 *     objectui#10865 removed; the four spec entries are the ones that drop).
 *
 * The real-build cases at the bottom carry their own control rather than a
 * mutation: the same bundle is built a second time through the literal
 * client-hook alias, and a green build there would mean this whole derivation is
 * unnecessary. Measured: it fails with 2 resolve errors.

 *    Bare-specifier resolution walks up from the importer looking for
 *    `node_modules`, and from `/tmp` there is none to find. Measured, and worth
 *    recording because it fails in the direction that reads as a result: every
 *    specifier came back `(unresolved)`, which an oracle without
 *    `VITE_ORACLE_CONTROL` would have reported as "no disagreements".
 * 2. It may NOT sit directly in the repo root either (objectui#9468). The i18n
 *    dead-key gate sweeps the whole repo root in one `grep -rFn` pass, and that
 *    grep exits 2 — not 1 — when a directory it has already enumerated is
 *    removed before it descends into it. `textFootprint()` in
 *    `scripts/check-i18n-dead-keys.mjs` rethrows every status but 1 deliberately
 *    and its comment says why, so an oracle run scheduled concurrently with that
 *    gate's test in the same shard took the whole shard down with it. The
 *    occurrences, with their job ids, are recorded on objectui#9468 — including
 *    one that ejected an already-green pull request from the merge queue.
 *
 * `<repoRoot>/node_modules` satisfies both: it is still inside the repository,
 * so the walk-up in (1) finds it, and it is skipped by the repo-wide scanners in
 * `scripts/` — the i18n sweep's own skip set among them — so nothing transient
 * placed here is ever walked. `check-action-ref-convention.test.ts` already puts
 * its throwaway root in the same place.
 *
 * ⚠ The invariant is POSITIONAL, not a name. Teaching one scanner to skip a
 * `.vite-oracle-*` prefix would fix that scanner and leave every other repo-root
 * sweep exposed to the next scratch directory anyone adds; the pin below
 * therefore asserts the position, not the prefix.

 *
 *   - **aborts**: the package is found, but its exports map has no such subpath.

 *     exports no `.`.
 *   - **skipped**: the package cannot be reached from the root. Vite logs

 *      it, subpaths included.

 * because Vite resolves a deduped package from the root and `apps/console`
 * declares no zod. The fixture builds below are the regression form of that
