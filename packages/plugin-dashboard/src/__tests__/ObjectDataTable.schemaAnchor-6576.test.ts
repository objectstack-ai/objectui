/**
 * objectui#6576 / #6914 — `ObjectDataTableProps.schema` is anchored to the
 * exported `ObjectDataTableSchema` (`extends BaseSchema`); the literal's own
 * `[key: string]: any` is gone, and the two keys the widget reads behind casts
 * (`drillDown`, `onRowClick`) are declared.
 *
 * ## Why this pin is compile-time
 *
 * Same reading as `ObjectDataTable.emitBoundary-6373.test.tsx` next door: the
 * widget renders identically before and after a type declaration, so only a
 * COMPILE can fail. `tsconfig.test.json` compiles this file.
 *
 * ## Direction of the move, stated (Clause ②)
 *
 * `ObjectDataTableProps` is NOT exported from `plugin-dashboard/src/index.tsx`
 * — it reaches consumers only structurally, as the prop type of the exported
 * component — so the breakage surface is the in-repo call sites.
 *
 *   - NARROWS: a wrong-typed base member is refused (`visible: 42` used to be
 *     absorbed by the literal's index signature); `type` is pinned to the
 *     registry key (it used to be bare `string`).
 *   - WIDENS, in declaration only: `drillDown` / `onRowClick` are now DECLARED
 *     with real types — before, they compiled through the index signature as
 *     `any`, which is why a wrong-shaped `drillDown` compiled too.
 *   - UNCHANGED, pinned honestly: an unknown key still compiles, because
 *     `BaseSchema`'s `[key: string]: any` is inherited (objectui#5155).
