/**
 * Every `on*` handler key a REGISTERED renderer reads off the authored document
 * must be a DECLARED member of the zod arm for the type it is registered under.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-handler-key-read-sites.mjs   (also `pnpm check:handler-key-reads`)
 *       node scripts/check-handler-key-read-sites.mjs --list   (every read site this gate judged)
 * Exit: 0 = every reachable `schema.onX` / `props.onX` read is a declared arm member,
 *       1 = at least one is not, or the census collapsed.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes (objectui#7753, the class card of objectui#7664 / PR #7743)
 *
 * `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`. A key that LEAVES an arm is therefore not
 * refused — it stops being judged and the value is KEPT. Measured on the built
 * dist at the head that carried it:
 *
 *   { type: 'kanban', columns: [], onCardClick: { action: 'toast' } }
 *     before the deletion : REFUSED
 *     after the deletion  : ACCEPTED, with {"action":"toast"} surviving into
 *                           the parsed output — and `KanbanRenderer` still
 *                           forwarding `schema.onCardClick` into the board.
 *
 * Every gate stayed green. The #6124 ledger
 * (`packages/types/src/__tests__/handler-keys-json-refusal-6124.test.ts`) is two
 * hand-written arrays of `[file, schema, key, mirror]` tuples plus a length
 * assertion, so its POPULATION IS A LITERAL: the change re-keyed the arm by
 * SUBSTITUTION (an `onQuickAdd` tuple replacing the `onCardClick` one), which
 * held `RUNTIME_SLOT` at 44 and `ALL_SITES` at 66. A count ratchet could not
 * have seen it, and the type-level `KeepsFunction` / `RetiredIsNever` blocks are
 * written per key, so a deleted pair simply stops being asserted.
 *
 * That file's own docblock warns about this hazard — but its counter-probe pins
 * the passthrough BEHAVIOUR on a fixture. Nothing pinned the ledger's MEMBERSHIP
 * to the renderers. This gate is that missing derivation, generalised off
 * `packages/plugin-kanban/src/__tests__/kanban-handler-slots-7664.test.tsx`,
 * whose suite 3 does exactly this for one arm and whose population is derived.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in `scripts/` and not in `@object-ui/types`
 *
 * The read-site half is spread across `@object-ui/plugin-*` and
 * `packages/components`. `@object-ui/types` may not import them —
 * `pnpm check:phantom-deps` rejects the dependency and it would close a cycle —
 * so the only place that can read both halves at once is a repo-level script.
 *
 * ## The census, stated as a rule
 *
 * Both populations are DERIVED. Nothing here is a list a re-key can hold
 * constant.
 *
 *   ARMS      every `type: z.literal('<t>')` object literal reachable from an
 *             exported `const` in `packages/types/src/zod/*.zod.ts`, with the
 *             members it declares (unioned along `.extend()` bases resolved in
 *             the same directory) and, for members built by
 *             `handlerKeyRefusal(key, disposition, …)`, that disposition.
 *   READS     for every real `ComponentRegistry.register('<t>', C, …)` CALL in
 *             `packages/<pkg>/src`: the `schema.onX` / `<props>.onX` property
 *             accesses inside `C`'s body, plus those inside every component `C`
 *             RENDERS that is declared in the same package (JSX element names,
 *             resolved through same-file declarations and static relative
 *             imports, transitively, with a visited set).
 *   FINDING   a read key at a type that HAS an arm, where the arm does not
 *             declare that key (`undeclared`), or declares it with the RETIRED
 *             disposition while a renderer still reads it (`retired-but-read`).
 *
 * The transitive hop is not a flourish: it is the shape of the very instance
 * this gate exists for. `'kanban'` registers `ObjectKanbanRenderer`, which
 * renders `ObjectKanban`, which renders `KanbanRenderer` — and `KanbanRenderer`
 * is where `schema.onCardClick` is read. A gate reading only the registered
 * component's own body is green on objectui#7664's deletion, which is the one
 * reading that would make it worthless.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT answer
 *
 * Each of these is a boundary, not an oversight:
 *
 *   1. **Keys that reach a renderer ONLY through a `{...props}` spread onto a
 *      Radix root or a DOM listener slot.** The seven `onOpenChange` overlays,
 *      `accordion` / `collapsible` / `toggle-group` / `tabs`, `button`'s
 *      `toFormControlDomProps` whitelist and `card`'s `<Card {...cardProps}>`
 *      reach the element without ever naming the key. There is no read site to
 *      derive from, so this gate says nothing about them; the #6124 ledger and
 *      `check-action-forward-parity.mjs` are what cover that channel.
 *   2. **The 22 RETIRED tombstones.** A tombstone exists precisely because
 *      nothing reads the key — it has no read site BY CONSTRUCTION, so it
 *      cannot be derived from one. What this gate does add there is the other
 *      direction: if a renderer ever starts reading a tombstoned key, that is a
 *      `retired-but-read` finding.
 *   3. **Types with no zod arm.** `'kanban-ui'`, `'kanban-enhanced'`,
 *      `'notifications'`, `'approvals'` and the rest of the app-shell surface
 *      are registered without a mirror. An arm that does not exist cannot have
 *      lost a member, and inventing an obligation there would be a different
 *      card.
 *   4. **Whether a declared key's TYPE is right.** That is the #6124 ledger's
 *      `KeepsFunction` / `RetiredIsNever` blocks, and it needs a type checker.
 *   5. **Lazy chunks.** `React.lazy(() => import('./KanbanImpl'))` is a dynamic
 *      import, not a statically resolvable component reference. Following it
 *      would mean guessing at a module graph the type checker owns.
 *
 * ## Rollout
 *
 * `KNOWN_UNDECLARED_READS` below is an EXEMPTION list, never the population, and
 * it only shrinks. Every row is a live defect with a card, not a waiver: a row
 * naming a read site this gate can no longer find FAILS the gate, the same
 * `KNOWN_HAND_SPELLINGS` rule PR #7789 landed. Its rows are the gate's own first
 * findings — arms whose renderer reads a key the mirror never declared, which is
 * the same passthrough exposure objectui#7753 names, standing on `main` before
 * this gate could see it. They are ledgered rather than fixed here because every
 * fix is a `packages/<pkg>/src` change and this card is Clause-② `no`.
