/**
 * A `tabs` item draws its panel from `content`, and ONLY from `content`
 * (objectui#9590).
 *
 * ## What was retired
 *
 * The `ui:tabs` renderer drew each panel as `item.content`, falling back to an
 * item-level `body` reached through an `any` cast. `TabItem` declares no `body`
 * on either published face: the TypeScript face has no such member, and
 * `TabItemSchema` (cited by SYMBOL, objectui#8875) declares `content` REQUIRED
 * and strips an undeclared `body`. So the fallback honoured a key the contract
 * refuses: the lenient-fallback shape AGENTS.md #0.1 bans by name. Nothing in
 * this tree authors it: objectui#9941 respelled the registration's own
 * `defaultProps` items to `content`, and the producer scan
 * (`pnpm census:body-dialect-producers`) is the instrument that re-derives that.
 *
 * ## The rows
 *
 * - `subject`: an item authored with `body` alone paints NOTHING from it. Red
 *   while the fallback exists (the panel shows the body text), green once it is
 *   gone.
 * - `control`: an item authored with `content` still paints its panel. Green in
 *   both worlds; it is what keeps `subject` from passing on a renderer that
 *   paints no panel at all.
 * - `precedence`: `content` beside `body` paints `content` and never `body`.
 *   Green in both worlds as well (the fallback only ran when `content` was
 *   falsy); it pins that the retirement did not move the primary arm.
 *
 * ⛔ No row pins message prose, and ⛔ none asserts `body` is refused at parse:
 * `TabItemSchema` strips it, and that measured behaviour is recorded by
 * `tabs-default-items-parse-9941.test.tsx` (`undeclaredBodyIsDropped`).
