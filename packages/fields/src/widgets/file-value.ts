/**
 * File field value shapes (ObjectStack ADR-0104 D3 wave 2).
 *
 * A `file`/`image`/`avatar`/`video`/`audio` field value reaches the UI in one
 * of three forms, and every widget that renders one has to cope with all
 * three — so the rules live here once rather than being re-derived per widget.
 *
 *  1. **Reference** — a bare `sys_file` id string. The form the backend stores
 *     once file-as-reference is adopted.
 *  2. **Expanded** — `{ id, name, size, mimeType, url }`, what the read path
 *     returns after resolving a stored reference. Note `mimeType`: this comes
 *     from the platform's spec-owned `FileValueSchema` and is **camelCase**.
 *  3. **Legacy inline blob** — `{ file_id?, name, original_name, size,
 *     mime_type, url }`, the pre-reference shape this package used to build
 *     itself, with **snake_case** `mime_type`.
 *
 * That casing split is the whole reason this module exists: a widget reading
 * only `mime_type` silently stops recognising images the moment the backend
 * starts returning the expanded form, and the failure looks like "thumbnails
 * disappeared" rather than anything pointing at a value shape.
 *
 * ## Submitting
 *
 * When the upload adapter surfaced a `fileId`, the widget submits the **bare
 * id** — the reference form. When it did not (the object-URL fallback adapter,
 * an older backend), it submits the legacy blob unchanged. So the same build
 * works against a backend that has adopted references and one that has not.
 * Action params already POST a bare fileId; this brings record field values
 * onto the same contract.

 * "mirrors the platform's `isFileIdToken`" while being a character-for-character
 * copy of that function's body under that function's own name — the shape
 * objectui#3003 argued about and objectui#3169 caught again in
 * `isAggregatedViewContainer`: every value test and every behaviour test passes
 * against a faithful copy, so reference identity is the only check that can tell
 * a re-export from a fork. It is asserted in
 * `__tests__/spec-symbol-batch7.test.ts`.
 *
 * Why it matters that this one is shared rather than duplicated: the regex is a
 * WIRE decision. Widening it server-side (say, ids grow past 64 chars) while a
 * copy here keeps the old bound turns every new id into "not a reference", and
 * the widget then submits the legacy inline blob against a backend that expects
 * a reference. That failure surfaces as a broken thumbnail, nowhere near a
 * regex.
