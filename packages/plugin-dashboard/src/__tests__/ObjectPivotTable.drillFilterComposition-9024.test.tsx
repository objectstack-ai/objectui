/**
 * objectui#9024 — the pivot's OWN filter survives into the drill-down query,
 * for BOTH dialects `ObjectPivotTable` reads at `schema.filter`.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The drill seam composed the pivot's filter with the click context by
 * SPREADING the first into an object literal:
 *
 *     { ...(schema.filter || {}), ...computeDrillFilter(…) }
 *
 * Spreading an ARRAY yields index keys, so an authored `[['region','=','emea']]`
 * drilled as `{ '0': ['region','=','emea'], stage: 'won', source: 'web' }` — the
 * pivot's conditions replaced by a key the query layer ignores. Nothing errored;
 * the drawer opened and looked right, scoped by the clicked cell ALONE. The same
 * statement objectui#8944 removed from `ObjectChart` one block over.
 *
 * ⚠️ The direction matters: the pivot's filter is what NARROWS. Dropping it
 * makes the drilled list a SUPERSET — it shows records the pivot itself was
 * scoped to exclude.
 *
 * ## Why the array arm is reachable here, measured rather than assumed
 *
 * `PivotTableSchema` declares no `filter` at all (the type that admits the value
 * is a local props-intersection `filter?: any`, which is strictly MORE
 * permissive than the chart's union), so nothing refuses the array form. And it
 * is not only a hand author who can produce it:
 *
 *   - `object-pivot`'s registry entry advertises `{ name: 'filter', type:
 *     'array' }` in its designer `inputs` (`plugin-dashboard/src/index.tsx`);
 *   - `ElementDataSourceGate` WRITES the array arm mechanically. Binding a pivot
 *     the way the spec documents (`dataSource: { object, view }`) sets
 *     `schema.filter` to `mergeFilterNodes(schema.filter, view.filter)` — an
 *     ObjectQL AST node — for every saved view that carries a filter
 *     (`ObjectPivot.elementDataSource.test.tsx` pins that binding).
 *
 * So the pre-fix drill dropped the scope of every view-bound pivot, not just of
 * a pivot whose author happened to pick the array spelling.
 *
 * ## What these cases assert, and why not the index keys
 *
 * Asserting that `'0'` is absent from the composed object would pin the SYMPTOM.
 * These cases assert the SEMANTICS instead — the composed filter is run through
 * `ValueDataSource`, a real matcher for the `$filter` dialect, over a fixture
 * built so the three possible outcomes are three different row sets:
 *
 *   pivot filter alone  (`region = emea`)           → a, c
 *   click context alone (`stage = won, source = web`) → a, b   ← the pre-fix superset
 *   both, conjoined                                  → a       ← the only correct answer
 *
 * The pivot's filter is deliberately on a field that is NEITHER axis, so losing
 * it changes the row set; a filter on `rowField`/`columnField` would be
 * re-stated by the click context and could not discriminate. The two
 * single-source answers are asserted as live controls, so the fixture cannot go
 * vacuous without saying so.
 *
 * ## Why the observation point is `openRecordList`
 *
 * `DrillDownDrawer`'s `target: 'navigate'` hands the composed filter to the host
 * verbatim — one spy, no DOM archaeology over a drilled table. The in-place
 * drawer arm is pinned through the same spy via its "Open in list" escape hatch,
 * which passes the drawer's own `filter` prop; the last case proves the two
 * agree rather than assuming it.
