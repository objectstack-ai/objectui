 * objectui#7559 — THE RELAY RUNG CENSUS.
 *
 * `renderListView` in `./ObjectView.tsx` composes `fullSchema: ListViewSchema`
 * out of the host's list schema and a set of rungs that read the ACTIVE VIEW
 * (`viewDef`). The output is typed; the input is not — `viewDef` is an element
 * of what `buildViewTabs` returns, `Array<Record<string, any> & { id: string }>`,
 * and its own inputs (`definedViews`, `savedViews`, `viewOverrides`) are `any`
 * too. So the compiler checks that a rung's NAME is a legal member, and nothing
 * at all checks the other direction: a `ListViewSchema` member with NO rung is
 * not a type error, not a lint finding and not a test failure. It is silence,
 * and the silence has now produced the same defect three times —
 * objectui#7199 (`description`), objectui#7218 (`rowColor`), objectui#7516
 * (`fieldOrder`, still open).
 *
 * This file is the ruling on that card: option (b). The census is not a list
 * somebody typed once — it is RE-DERIVED here, at test time, from four sources
 * on disk, and every absence must be DECLARED WITH A REASON in `ABSENCES`
 * below. A member that is neither relayed nor declared fails BY NAME.
 *
 * ## THE READING — what counts as a member, what counts as a rung
 *
 * The card said "47 named keys". Three defensible ways of counting that
 * literal give 48, 36 and 66, and none of them is 47, so the number is not the
 * subject and no number is asserted here. The READING is:
 *
 *   MEMBER (the population, 93 today, derived — never listed):
 *     - every key of the zod mirror's `.shape` (`@object-ui/types/zod`
 *       `ListViewSchema`). That mirror is what the TYPE is made of:
 *       `ListViewSchema = ListViewInferred & ListViewRuntimeProps` and
 *       `ListViewInferred = z.input<typeof ListViewSchema>`, so its shape IS
 *       the serialisable member set, including everything `BaseSchema` and
 *       `@objectstack/spec` contribute by reference.
 *     - plus the members of `ListViewRuntimeProps`, read out of
 *       `packages/types/src/objectql.ts` by the TypeScript parser. They are the
 *       other half of the same intersection; leaving them out would let the
 *       census claim to cover a type it only half enumerates.
 *     A member is a TOP-LEVEL key of the target type. Keys nested inside a
 *     member's own shape (`aria.live`, `kanban.groupByField`) are that member's
 *     business, not this census's: the unit a rung writes is a top-level key.
 *
 *   RUNG (relayed): a property assignment in the `fullSchema` literal whose
 *     value expression references the identifier `viewDef`, or a local computed
 *     from it (`calendarOptions`, derived below rather than allowed by name) —
 *     i.e. the ACTIVE VIEW's value can reach `ListView`. `...listSchema` is
 *     deliberately NOT a rung: it carries the HOST's value, which is exactly
 *     what was on screen in all three defects while the view's own value was
 *     dropped.
 *
 * Every member that is not relayed needs an entry in `ABSENCES` giving a `kind`
 * and a `reason`. The `kind` is not decoration: each one carries a piece of
 * MECHANICAL evidence checked below, so a declaration cannot quietly become
 * false. `relayed-upstream` re-derives the caller's own composition literal in
 * `plugin-view`; `relayed-nested` names the path inside the literal and it must
 * exist; `unread` requires that `ListView` still has no reader for the key;
 * `known-gap` requires that it still HAS one.
 *
 * ⇒ That is what turns "the absences are deliberate" from a whole-literal
 * assumption (the card's option (c)) into a per-key claim anyone can re-read.
 *
 * ## Why the census, and not just a type on `viewDef` (measured)
 *
 * The card's option (a) was to give `viewDef` the view-entry type it actually
 * carries. That was measured before this file was written: annotating it
 * `NamedListView & { id: string }` and running `tsc --noEmit` over the package
 * produces 22 diagnostics, and NOT ONE of them is a missing rung. Every one is
 * the opposite direction — a key the relay READS that the declared view type
 * does not carry (`rowColor`, `appearance`, `chart`, `tree`, `map`, `name`,
 * `editRecordsInline`). That is the sibling finding objectui#7483 owns.
 *
 * ⇒ (a) cannot deliver this card's headline. A type on the read side says what
 * a value IS; nothing about it REQUIRES the literal to write a key it never
 * mentions, so an absent rung stays absent and silent. (a) is necessary for
 * other reasons and not sufficient for this one. Hence (b), here.
 *
 * ## What this file does NOT do
 *
 * ⛔ It does not fill in a missing rung. Each absent rung is its own card
 *    (`fieldOrder` is objectui#7516, which carries `needs-user-decision`);
 *    this file only makes absences visible and keeps them declared.
 * ⛔ It does not touch `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView` — that host is the
 *    objectui#5043 family, and its own pin
 *    (`plugin-view/src/__tests__/objectViewHostSurface.test.tsx`) is the
 *    same technique pointed the other way. This file only READS its source.
 * ⛔ It asserts no count. Counts drift by construction; the property is what
 *    holds.
