/**
 * The five widgets that never read the delivered `error` now report
 * `aria-invalid` on a FOCUSABLE control, through the real inline seam
 * (objectui#7126).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * objectui#7008 made `FieldEditWidget` DELIVER the declared `error` key
 * (`toHostProps`, landed as f08bcd9af). Of the 27 distinct components in
 * `EDIT_WIDGETS`, 21 read it; five did not — `TextField`, `BooleanField`
 * (`boolean` + `toggle`), `DateField`, `DateTimeField`, `TimeField` — so for
 * their field types the delivery was inert and `aria-invalid` was still never
 * set. `text` being in that set is what made it live rather than tidy: it is
 * the most common type in any object, and the kanban `RequiredFieldsDialog`
 * renders whatever types the target column made required.
 *
 * ## Why the FACTORY and not the widgets directly
 *
 * In the FORM these five were already announced correctly and always had been:
 * `<FormControl>` is a Radix `Slot`, its `aria-invalid` reached the control
 * through each widget's props spread untouched, and
 * `widget-aria-invalid-registry-e2e.test.tsx` sweeps exactly that path with an
 * EMPTY `NOT_YET_DELIVERED` ledger. So a form-based test would have been green
 * before this change and proves nothing about it.
 *
 * `FieldEditWidget` renders no Slot. It is the seam every NON-form host
 * composes — the grid's inline cell editor, the detail page's inline edit
 * (`InlineFieldInput`), the kanban required-fields dialog — and the only way
 * the state reaches the control there is the declared `error` prop. That is
 * the path that was broken, so that is the path measured here.
 *
 * ## What is NOT claimed
 *
 * The marking only. objectui#3222's slot drives `aria-invalid` and renders no
 * text; the visible message stays with the host. Nothing here becomes visible
 * that was not visible before.
