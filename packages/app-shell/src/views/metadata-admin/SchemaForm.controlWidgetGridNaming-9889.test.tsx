/**
 * objectui#9889 — a registered widget declared `labelling: 'control'` is named
 * by the column header when it renders inside a grid/table repeater CELL.
 *
 * ## What was measured (baseline `fc12bc8c6`, real `SchemaForm` renders)
 *
 * A grid row has no `<label>` by design: objectui#5063 writes the column name
 * once in the `<th>` and points every cell at it by IDREF, keeping the cell id
 * on the control as a plain anchor. So a cell hands its widget BOTH channels.
 * The nine widgets declared `labelling: 'group'` answered that IDREF; the
 * eleven declared `'control'` read only the id and dropped it, so every one of
 * them rendered as an UNNAMED edit box in every grid row:
 *
 * ```
 * cell, one repeater row      declared   aria-labelledby   aria-label
 * type:'tags' -> string-tags  control    null              null
 * secret                      control    null              null
 * condition                   group      mdf-rows.visible-col   —
 * ```
 *
 * ## The question this file answers, because the fix turns on it
 *
 * `labelling` answers ONE question — can the host's `<label for>` reach a
 * labelable element? — and it stays two-valued: collapsing it re-opens the
 * dangling `for` objectui#3978/#4010 closed. What was wrong is a SECOND meaning
 * read into it: that `'control'` also declares which naming channel the widget
 * consumes. `FieldRow`'s "exactly one of `id` / `ariaLabelledBy`" is a rule
 * about a host THAT HAS A LABEL; `FieldControl`'s builtin branches already say
 * so in as many words and already emit both. Only the registry widgets were
 * left behind. So the repair is not a collapse: every `'control'` widget puts
 * the IDREF on the same labelable element that takes the id.
 *
 * ## What this file pins — both sides, and the exemption
 *
 *  1. every key `WIDGET_LABELLING` declares `'control'` resolves, in a grid
 *     cell, to a control whose ACCESSIBLE NAME is its column — read off a real
 *     render, ⛔ never off a prop or a source string;
 *  2. the case list is checked against the registry itself, so a twelfth
 *     `'control'` widget cannot be added without a reading here;
 *  3. the `'group'` side still answers the same IDREF in the same render — the
 *     control that makes a green `'control'` row admissible rather than a
 *     harness that names everything;
 *  4. the CARD layout of the same spec keeps its plain `<label for>` and gains
 *     NO `aria-labelledby` — the channel that was already correct is untouched;
 *  5. ⭐ the NEGATIVE: the auxiliary affordances inside a `'control'` widget —
 *     a reveal toggle, the hex mirror beside a colour input — are EXEMPT. They
 *     keep their own names and take no IDREF. Without this pin the next reader
 *     "completes" the fix by spreading the naming over every control in the
 *     cell, and a grid row becomes a set of buttons that all announce the
 *     column name.
