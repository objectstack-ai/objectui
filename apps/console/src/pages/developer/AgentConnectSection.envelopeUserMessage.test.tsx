/**
 * objectui#7980 — the agent-key generator reads the ADR-0112 failure envelope
 * through the ONE shared rule.
 *
 * `AgentConnectSection.generateKey` read `json?.error?.message` and stopped, so
 * two DECLARED things never reached the developer whose key generation had just
 * been refused:
 *
 *  - `error.userMessage` — the producer's #9934 marked channel. Its PRESENCE is
 *    the marking, and the envelope writer's own rule is that a consumer which
 *    sees the field renders it verbatim. ⭐ The 5xx band is where the loss is
 *    expensive and where §3 below lives: the producing door substitutes the
 *    generic `Internal server error` into `message` while the mark rides
 *    through untouched, so a marked 500/503 showed the developer the generic
 *    sentence and discarded the specific one written for them.
 *  - `error.code`, which never reached the surface at all.
 *
 * The thrown string lands in `setError(...)` and IS the whole report the
 * developer gets, so this file drives the SECTION and reads what is rendered —
 * "the rule is right" (pinned once, in `@object-ui/app-shell`'s
 * `utils/apiErrorEnvelope.test.ts`) and "this reader actually asks it" are two
 * different claims, and only the second is what the developer sees. The case
 * table below is deliberately the same one that pin asserts, so the two cannot
 * drift silently: §1 unmarked, §2 marked-only, §3 both, §4 neither.
 *
 * ⛔ NOT pinned here: the `!data?.key`-on-200 arm. That is objectui#8782 /
 * PR objectui#8787, in flight on this same file and free to change the
 * `Request failed (n)` wording. A pin of that string from THIS card would be a
 * tripwire on that one's landing. This card left the condition byte-identical.
