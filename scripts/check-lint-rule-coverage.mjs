/**
 * TWO predicates over one walk, because there are two ways a source file can go
 * unjudged and only one of them was visible here before:
 *
 *   1. Every file ESLint WALKS must resolve at least one rule (objectui#7908).
 *   2. Every source file ESLint does NOT walk must be walked for a reason other
 *      than its EXTENSION (objectui#8337).
 *
 * Each has its own ledger, and both ledgers are shrink-only.
 *
 * ⚠️ Predicate 2 is a deliberate WIDENING of this gate's subject, added by the
 * PR that fixes objectui#8337. Until then this file's subject was the walked
 * population alone, and it said so in this line. The subject moved on purpose:
 * predicate 1 cannot see predicate 2's population BY CONSTRUCTION -- it reports
 * files ESLint walks, and those files are not walked at all.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-lint-rule-coverage.mjs   (also `pnpm check:lint-rule-coverage`)
 * Exit: 0 = every walked file resolves rules or is ledgered AND every unwalked
 *       source file is unwalked for some reason other than its extension or is
 *       ledgered, 1 = any of those is violated, a ledger row has gone stale, or
 *       a census/probe control collapsed
 *
 * ## The two truths this gate exists to separate (objectui#7908)
 *
 * Both of these sentences are true on `main` at the same time, and that is the
 * whole finding:
 *
 *   pnpm lint:coverage  ->  46/46 packages linted, 0 with outstanding errors
 *   pnpm lint:root      ->  272 files walked, 95 of them resolve ZERO rules
 *
 * `scripts/check-lint-coverage.mjs` asks whether a package RUNS ESLint. It
 * reads `package.json` for a `lint` script and nothing else, so a package that
 * runs ESLint over files ESLint has no rules for is, to that gate, fully
 * covered. It is not wrong; it answers a different question, and its answer is
 * the reason nobody looked further.
 *
 * The rule-bearing config objects in `eslint.config.js` are all scoped
 * `files: ['**\/*.{ts,tsx}']` or narrower -- including the `no-console`
 * exemption, whose `scripts/**` carve-out is spelled
 * `scripts/**\/*.{ts,tsx}`. So the entire `.js` / `.mjs` / `.cjs` family
 * resolves an EMPTY rule set. ESLint parses those files, reports nothing, and
 * exits 0; every downstream reading -- the workflow's exit code, the package's
 * `lint` script, the coverage gate above -- reads that as clean.
 *
 * Measured on `fedfa3e4a` with a real install, ESLint v10.8.1, via
 * `eslint --print-config FILE` and cross-checked with the ESLint Node API:
 *
 *   scripts/github-slug.mjs         ->    0 rules
 *   scripts/check-lint-coverage.mjs ->    0 rules
 *   eslint.config.js                ->    0 rules
 *   eslint-rules/index.js           ->    0 rules
 *   playwright.config.ts            ->  116 rules   <- control
 *   apps/console/src/__tests__/bootSplash.test.ts -> 117 rules   <- control
 *
 * The two controls are what make the zeros a READING rather than a broken
 * invocation, and they were taken in the same run on the same install.
 *
 * ## What this gate does NOT do
 *
 * It does not turn any rule on. Whether the `.js` family should get
 * `js.configs.recommended` is a gate-STRENGTH decision with an unmeasured red
 * set, and it has its own owner and its own card. This gate only makes the
 * vacuity VISIBLE: a file ESLint walks with an empty rule set is reported
 * rather than counted as covered.
 *
 * ## Why a sibling script rather than an extension of check-lint-coverage.mjs
 *
 * Different question, different input, different granularity. That gate reads
 * `package.json` files and answers per PACKAGE; this one needs an ESLint
 * instance and a tree walk and answers per FILE. Folding them together would
 * produce one gate whose failure message has to answer two unrelated questions,
 * and would falsify that file's own header, which states its subject in its
 * first line. Keeping them apart is also what keeps BOTH numbers printed on
 * every run -- `46/46 packages linted` and `123 files resolve zero rules` are
 * the pair that makes the gap legible, and a merged gate would print one
 * summary line again.
 *
 * ## Why `eslint.config.js` and `eslint-rules/**` are COUNTED, not exempted
 *
 * The obvious objection to this gate is that it reddens on its own config file
 * on day one. It does not, and the reason is the ledger: every vacuous file
 * that exists today is a declared row, so the first run is GREEN with the
 * config file counted. Once that is true, a blanket exemption for
 * "config-and-rules files" would be a SECOND mechanism doing what the ledger
 * already does -- and strictly worse, because an exemption is invisible while a
 * ledger row carries a reason and goes red when it stops applying.
 *
 * Measured both ways before choosing:
 *
 *   counting them   -> 8 rows, 123 files (124 once this file is committed --
 *                      it is a `scripts/*.mjs`, so the gate counts itself)
 *   exempting them  -> 6 rows, 103 files, and 20 files silently outside the
 *                      instrument
 *
 * The 20 are not incidental. `eslint-rules/**` is 19 hand-written files -- ten
 * rule implementations and their `.test.js` neighbours -- and they implement
 * the ratchets `eslint.config.js` sets to `error`. "The code that enforces our
 * lint rules is itself unlinted" is a finding somebody may want to act on; an
 * exemption would delete it from the output permanently and unmeasured.
 *
 * ## The ledger, and the three directions it goes red
 *
 * {@link VACUOUS_GROUPS} is an EXEMPTION list, never the population. Rows are
 * GLOBS, not paths: a row is a statement about a POPULATION ("every JS-family
 * file under `scripts/` resolves zero rules"), which is why a new
 * `scripts/check-foo.mjs` does not red this gate -- the row already declares
 * it, and nothing new is hidden. That is a measured choice, not a convenience:
 * 38 new JS-family files landed under `scripts/` and `eslint-rules/` in the 14
 * days before this gate, so an exact per-row COUNT would have reddened on
 * essentially every tooling PR with "increment a number" as its remedy. A
 * ratchet whose remedy is not the fix is a ratchet that gets switched off.
 *
 * The three reds are:
 *
 *   1. UNLEDGERED -- a walked file resolving zero rules that no row matches.
 *      This is the new-vacuity direction, and it names the file.
 *   2. OVER-BROAD -- a row that also matches a walked file which DOES resolve
 *      rules. This is the "a file left the row" direction: narrow the glob so
 *      the row keeps claiming only what is actually vacuous. It is what makes
 *      partial progress visible without pinning a count.
 *   3. STALE -- a row that matches no walked file at all, or matches only
 *      rule-bearing files. The vacuity it declares is gone; delete the row.
 *
 * A row can therefore only ever be narrowed or deleted, which is the
 * shrink-only property, and it is enforced by the gate rather than by
 * convention.
 *
 * ## How "ESLint walks it" is decided
 *
 * `ESLint#isPathIgnored` is the answer, not a re-implementation of the walk. In
 * flat config a file is "ignored" both when a global `ignores` pattern names it
 * AND when no config object's `files` matches it, which is exactly the
 * predicate wanted here -- `README.md` and `vitest.config.mts` both come back
 * ignored, and neither appears in a real run's output.
 *
 * Cross-checked against ground truth rather than assumed: the enumeration below
 * was compared with the `filePath` set of a real
 * `eslint . --ignore-pattern ... --format json` run at the `lint:root` scope on
 * `fedfa3e4a`. 272 files, 272 matches, zero difference in either direction.
 *
 * ⚠️ That equivalence is exact only up to the git filter below: since
 * objectui#8369 the walk drops paths GIT ignores, so on a tree that has been
 * built this enumeration is deliberately SMALLER than `eslint .`'s. The
 * difference is always exactly the ignored paths, and the pin asserts that
 * shape rather than plain equality.
 * `scripts/__tests__/check-lint-rule-coverage.test.ts` re-pins that equivalence
 * against `ESLint#lintFiles` on a fixture tree, where it costs milliseconds.
 *
 * Rule resolution is `ESLint#calculateConfigForFile`, the API half of
 * `--print-config`. Three return shapes, all three load-bearing:
 *
 *   undefined                      -> not walked (also `isPathIgnored`)
 *   an object with no `rules` key  -> WALKED, zero rules  <- the finding
 *   an object with `rules`         -> covered
 *
 * ## Why the vacuous population is exactly the JS family, and cannot be `.ts`
 *
 * Measured, because the obvious mental model is wrong. In flat config a `.ts`
 * file is walked ONLY because some config object's `files` names it, while
 * `.js` / `.cjs` / `.mjs` are linted BY DEFAULT whether or not any config
 * object mentions them. So the two extensions fail in different directions:
 *
 *   narrow every `**\/*.{ts,tsx}` to `**\/*.tsx`
 *     -> `packages/core/src/index.ts` becomes `isPathIgnored: true`, config
 *        `undefined`. 776 files leave the WALK. Zero-rule count: unchanged.
 *   add `{ files: ['**\/*.mts'] }` with no rules
 *     -> `vitest.config.mts` ENTERS the walk with an empty rule set, and this
 *        gate reds naming it.
 *
 * Narrowing a glob therefore cannot manufacture vacuity; only the default-lint
 * set, or a `files:` entry that carries no rules, can. That second shape is the
 * real-world way this defect gets ADDED to a config, and it is the fourth
 * ablation leg on this gate's PR.
 *
 * ## Predicate 2: the extensions ESLint reaches for NEITHER reason (objectui#8337)
 *
 * The section above ends on `{ files: ['**\/*.mts'] }` ENTERING the walk. The
 * neighbouring state is the one where nothing puts `.mts` in the walk at all,
 * and predicate 1 is blind to it by construction: it reports files ESLint
 * walks.
 *
 * Re-measured on `868e825012` (this branch's base) with a real install, ESLint
 * v10.8.1, via the Node API -- three controls in one run, three DISTINCT
 * states, which is what makes any of them a reading:
 *
 *   vitest.config.mts        -> isPathIgnored: true,  config undefined   NOT WALKED
 *   playwright.config.ts     -> isPathIgnored: false, 116 rules          walked + ruled
 *   scripts/github-slug.mjs  -> isPathIgnored: false,   0 rules          predicate 1's class
 *
 * ⭐ `undefined` is not "zero rules" -- it is ESLint declining to look. Collapse
 * the three states into one and the finding disappears.
 *
 * In flat config a file is linted only if some config object's `files` matches
 * it, PLUS the default set ESLint always lints (`.js` / `.cjs` / `.mjs`). Every
 * rule-bearing object here is scoped TS-and-TSX, so an extension in neither
 * place falls through both.
 *
 * ## Why this predicate is over EXTENSIONS and not over `.mts`
 *
 * A predicate that knows only about `.mts` reproduces the blind spot one size
 * smaller. So the unreachable set is DERIVED from the live config on every run
 * -- {@link extensionReach} probes a synthetic path per source extension -- and
 * the measurement immediately paid for itself. On `868e825012` it is:
 *
 *   reachable    js cjs mjs (default set)  ts tsx (the rule-bearing globs)
 *   unreachable  jsx  cts  mts
 *
 * ⭐ THREE, not one. `.jsx` is unreachable here for exactly the same reason as
 * `.mts` and neither the card nor its triage names it; there are no `.jsx`
 * files today, so nothing reported it and nothing would have. Deriving the set
 * rather than listing it is also what makes the ledger shrink-only in the right
 * direction: widen a rule-bearing glob to cover `.mts` and the extension leaves
 * the unreachable set, its ledger row stops matching, and the row goes STALE.
 *
 * ## Why the per-file test substitutes an extension instead of trusting the walk
 *
 * `isPathIgnored` is true for `packages/core/dist/x.mts` as well, and that file
 * is ignored for a completely legitimate reason -- its LOCATION. Measured, same
 * run: inside `**\/dist` and `**\/.source` every one of the eight source
 * extensions comes back ignored, while at the repository root, under
 * `scripts/`, and under `packages/core/src/` the answer is identical and
 * extension-shaped. So the discrimination is per file and mechanical: take the
 * candidate's own path, substitute a REACHABLE extension onto it, and ask
 * again. If some substitution is walked, then the extension -- and nothing else
 * about that path -- is why ESLint declines to look. If every substitution is
 * still ignored, the path is excluded by location or by name and this gate has
 * nothing to say about it.
 *
 * ## Why predicate 2 has a ledger at all, and why its rows are PATHS
 *
 * There is one file in the population today, repo-wide, and it is
 * `vitest.config.mts` (`.cts` and `.jsx` have no files). Reaching it means
 * widening a rule-bearing `files` glob, whose red set is UNMEASURED -- a rule
 * STRENGTH decision that objectui#8337's triage deliberately kept OUT of the
 * gate that reports it. So the file is declared, exactly as predicate 1
 * declares `eslint.config.js`, and the first run is green with it counted.
 *
 * ⚠️ Its rows are exact PATHS where {@link VACUOUS_GROUPS}'s rows are
 * population globs, and the difference is not an inconsistency. There, a new
 * `scripts/check-foo.mjs` adds no new information -- the row already declares
 * that whole class, and 38 such files landed in 14 days. Here, the entire point
 * is that the NEXT `.mts` or `.cts` gets reported: a `**\/*.mts` row would
 * waive precisely the thing this predicate exists to catch, turning a gate into
 * a permanent exemption.
 *
 * ## What keeps predicate 2 from passing vacuously
 *
 * A gate that would be green on an empty population is not a gate, and this one
 * CAN reach an empty population legitimately -- that is what fixing it looks
 * like. So the non-vacuity control is on the INSTRUMENT rather than on the
 * population, and it survives the fix: {@link extensionProbeCollapse} requires
 * the probe to answer BOTH ways in the same run -- at least one source
 * extension reachable (so the config loaded and the rule-bearing globs are
 * live), and a synthetic extension no config object can name coming back
 * unreachable (so the probe is able to say "no" at all). If those two hold and
 * the unreachable set is empty, the emptiness is a reading.
 *
 * ## Why the walk asks git what is in the repository (objectui#8369)
 *
 * A file on disk is not the same thing as a file in the repository, and this
 * gate used to conflate them. `apps/console/plugin.js` is a build OUTPUT --
 * `apps/console/.gitignore` names it, it is absent from `HEAD`, and it appears
 * only after `turbo run build` -- so the gate reported it as unledgered vacuity
 * and exited 1 on any developer who had built. Measured on `1cca4415e`:
 *
 *   before any build       pnpm check:lint-rule-coverage   exit 0
 *   after turbo run build                                  exit 1
 *                            unledgered: apps/console/plugin.js
 *   control: rm that one file, re-run                      exit 0
 *
 * ⭐ That is the failure a coverage gate can least afford: the verdict was a
 * property of the WORKING TREE rather than of the tree under test, which makes
 * its green as unexplainable as its red. It also collides with this
 * repository's own workflow -- `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs` and
 * `check-skill-examples.mjs` both exit 2 with "run the build first", so obeying
 * them reddens this gate, and the red points at a file nobody wrote and nobody
 * can fix at the site.
 *
 * The remedy is NOT a ledger row: {@link VACUOUS_GROUPS} is a list of decisions
 * about files that are in the repository, and a row for a generated path would
 * be a permanent waiver nobody can ever check or shrink. Nor is it a second
 * ignore list here -- that would be a copy of `.gitignore` needing to be kept
 * in sync with it, which is the defect one level up.
 *
 * So the walk asks git, which is the only thing entitled to answer. One batched
 * `git check-ignore --stdin -z` over the candidates, and the paths it names are
 * dropped from BOTH populations before anything is judged. Its semantics are
 * exactly the wanted ones, measured rather than assumed:
 *
 *   untracked + matched by an ignore rule  -> reported   DROPPED (build output)
 *   TRACKED, even when a rule matches it   -> not reported, stays in the census
 *   untracked + matched by nothing         -> not reported, stays in the census
 *
 * ⭐ That last row is why this is a git-IGNORE filter and not `git ls-files`.
 * Enumerating tracked files would drop a source file that exists but has not
 * been `git add`ed yet -- and then the verdict would depend on whether the
 * developer happened to stage, which is the same defect wearing a different
 * hat. A brand-new unstaged `scripts/check-foo.mjs` is still reported.
 *
 * The reading has its own control, on the INSTRUMENT and in the same run --
 * {@link gitIgnoreReading} appends two synthetic paths to the batch and
 * {@link gitIgnoreCollapse} requires both answers: `node_modules/<probe>` must
 * come back IGNORED (the process ran and can say yes) and the same probe at the
 * repository root must come back VISIBLE (it can say no). An empty ignored set
 * is then a reading -- which is what an unbuilt tree legitimately looks like --
 * rather than a `git` that failed and silently answered "nothing".
 *
 * Outside a git work tree there is nothing to ask, so the filter reports itself
 * unavailable and the walk is what it always was. That is the state the fixture
 * trees in the pin test are in, and {@link main} refuses it: for THIS
 * repository an unavailable filter is the broken state, not a lenient one.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * Measured on `fedfa3e4a`, this branch's base: 4438 walked files out of 6699 on disk. Directory
 * walk 23ms, `isPathIgnored` 1.9s, `calculateConfigForFile` 29ms -- about two
 * seconds end to end, one process, no lint pass. Spawning `eslint
 * --print-config` once per file was never attempted at this scale: it is one
 * ESLint startup per file, seconds each. The per-file API call is 3.65ms
 * amortised, so there is no need to resolve per file-GROUP instead of per file,
 * and this gate does not.
 *
 * The git filter adds two short-lived processes to that, not one per file:
 * `rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`, then a single `check-ignore --stdin -z`
 * fed every candidate path at once. Measured on `1cca4415e` over a built tree,
 * 4523 candidates, three runs: 6ms for the work-tree probe and 407 / 414 /
 * 484ms for the batch, against 2.5s for the walk it sits on -- about a sixth
 * more, for one process. Per-path spawning was never a candidate at this
 * scale, for the same reason `eslint --print-config` per file was not. The
 * candidates are also filtered BEFORE `calculateConfigForFile` runs, so the
 * dropped paths cost no rule resolution at all.
 *
 * ## Wiring, and what actually enforces this
 *
 * `package.json` only, as `check:lint-rule-coverage`. There is no dedicated
 * `ci.yml` step, and that is the same position objectui#8301 left
 * `check:unused-deps` in: it asked for one and was closed `not planned` on
 * 2026-09-07. 15 of this repository's `check:*` scripts run in no workflow.
 *
 * What enforces this gate today is its pin test. The `this repository is green`
 * case in `scripts/__tests__/check-lint-rule-coverage.test.ts` runs the whole
 * analysis inside `pnpm test`, so a new unledgered zero-rule file fails CI in
 * the PR that adds it. The costs of that route are the ones objectui#8301
 * named and are real here too: the failure surfaces as one assertion inside a
 * 120-file scripts suite rather than as a step named after the gate, and it
 * lands in the heavy half of CI when this check is a two-second, install-only
 * run. Recorded rather than worked around -- `.github/workflows/**` was outside
 * this session's declared file surface, exactly as in objectui#8301.
