 * objectui#9571 — an authored `data` key takes NO React prop seat on a block
 * whose published `data` row is the OBJECT arm.
 *
 * ## The ruling, and the carrier it closes
 *
 * objectui#8348 Q2-C, decision batch #136 item 3, maintainer 「同意」 on the
 * seat's recommendation. 「8348 以协议为准」 (batch #83) retired the bare-array
 * `data` shorthand at the shared ladder, but `SchemaRenderer` spreads every
 * non-metadata node key as a React prop — so the authored key reached an
 * object-arm block TWICE, and the surviving carrier is the one that wins:
 * `ObjectGrid` (`passedData`), `ObjectMap` (`dataProp`) and `ObjectGantt` all
 * lift a `data` PROP with an unconditional `Array.isArray` at HIGHER priority
 * than the ladder. AGENTS.md #0.1: one key, one honoured spelling — the
 * tolerated second carrier is the defect.
 *
 * ## Why the probe is a stub and not a real block
 *
 * The question this file owns is what `SchemaRenderer` HANDS OVER, and a real
 * grid answers a different one (did rows appear), through a fetch effect, an
 * adapter and a dozen unrelated decisions. The plugin packages own the
 * end-to-end halves (`gridBareArrayDataRefused-8348.test.tsx`,
 * `ObjectMap.schemaDataShorthand.test.tsx`); this file reads the props bag
 * itself, which is the only lens that can tell the two carriers apart. The
 * real plugins are not importable here in any case — they depend on this
 * package, not the other way round.
 *
 * ## The must-NOT-change leg is in this file on purpose
 *
 * ⛔ Option B — gating the PROP on the arm — was REFUSED, because the prop is
 * how a host hands down rows it already fetched. Rows 5 and 6 are that leg: a
 * host's own React `data` prop still arrives, and a node that authors no `data`
 * is handed a byte-identical bag.
