/**
 * `object-metric.drillDown` — the MEMBER SHAPE of the click-through config
 * (objectui#8071).
 *
 * The member pin for the second of the two PRESENTATION keys objectui#8071's
 * ninth slice takes, and the one that needs its cut stated: `drillDown` DOES
 * issue a query of its own — the drawer's record list runs off the metric's
 * resolved filter — so "reaches an adapter" is not what separates these two
 * keys from slice 8's four. The line is `fetchMetric` / `computeOne`, the path
 * that produces the NUMBER. This key cannot change the number; it decides what
 * opens when the number is clicked.
 *
 * Asserted through the REGISTERED block (`type: 'object-metric'` mounted by
 * `SchemaRenderer`) rather than on `ObjectMetricWidget` directly, so the pin
 * covers the path an author reaches: the block's `ElementDataSourceGate` shell
 * re-binds only `objectName` and `filter` and forwards this key untouched.
 *
 * ## What the protocol says, and why this pin is BEHAVIOUR
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s `ObjectMetricPropsSchema` governs this block and
 * declares the key as `z.unknown().optional()`, described as "Click-through
 * drill config — opens the underlying records". The protocol deliberately does
 * not pin the member shape, so — exactly as `object-kanban.swimlaneField`
 * records for its own `z.unknown()` row — the READ SITE is the whole member
 * contract this block carries, and a member pin here can only be a reading of
 * the renderer. Declaring a narrower `object-metric` drill schema on this side
 * would make this repo stricter than the protocol it renders, which is the
 * wrong direction to fix anything in.
 *
 * ## The members `ObjectMetricWidget` actually reads
 *
 *   - **`enabled`** — through `isDrillEnabled`, which is `config.enabled !==
 *     false`, NOT `!!config.enabled`. So `{}` is ENABLED and only an explicit
 *     `false` turns it off. That distinction is the row a "simplification" to
 *     a truthiness check silently breaks, and it is pinned with all four arms
 *     (absent / `{}` / `true` / `false`) against each other.
 *   - **`enabled` is not sufficient on its own.** The tile becomes clickable
 *     only when an object name AND a data source are also present — a drill
 *     that could not list anything is not offered, rather than offered and
 *     empty.
 *   - **`target`** — `'dialog'` draws a centred modal, anything else the
 *     edge-anchored side sheet. Each arm is the other's control, so a renderer
 *     that drew one shape for both cannot pass.
 *   - **`title`** — through `resolveDrillTitle`, which OUTRANKS the tile's own
 *     `title` and `label`. The fallback chain below it is `title` then `label`
 *     then the literal "Details".
 *   - **`report`** — its own SHAPE selects the branch: a report object carrying
 *     an `objectName` (or an array `columns`) sends the drawer body to a
 *     `spec-report` schema, and anything else falls through to the inline
 *     record list. That is asserted on the observable that separates the two
 *     branches — whether the record list is fetched at all.
 *
 * And the invariant the whole key hangs off: the drilled record list is scoped
 * by the METRIC's own resolved filter, macros already substituted. The
 * registration promises exactly this ("The same filter narrows the drill-down
 * list, so the number and the records behind it always agree"), and a drawer
 * that listed every row of the object would be the quiet failure — a plausible
 * record list that answers a different question from the tile above it.
 *
 * ## LIMITS, stated rather than frozen into an assertion
 *
 * `DrillDownConfig` is shared by five widgets, and when this pin was written
 * this one hand-rolled its own drawer instead of using `DrillDownDrawer`. Three
 * members the shared component honours had no read site on this block:
 * `columns`, `maxRows`, and `target: 'navigate'`. `filter` and `mode` had none
 * either — a metric has no click event to interpolate `${event.*}` against, and
 * its whole slice is the one filter. None of that was asserted here: pinning
 * "this member is dead" would freeze the gap instead of reporting it, and a pin
 * that has to be deleted before the gap can be closed is worse than no pin.
 * Filed as objectui#8970.
 *
 * ⇒ objectui#8970 has since routed the block through `DrillDownDrawer`, and the
 * restraint paid out exactly as intended: the first three now ACT and not one
 * assertion in this file had to be deleted to let them — every row below still
 * passes unchanged against the shared drawer. Their effects are pinned in
 * `ObjectMetricWidget.drillRoutedToSharedDrawer-8970.test.tsx`. `filter` and
 * `mode` are still unread here (the shared drawer honours neither), and are
 * still deliberately not asserted.
 *
 * ## Nothing pre-existing covered this key
 *
 * Measured, then read end to end. The repo's locator (`memberPinProblem`)
 * requires a pin file to name BOTH the block and the key; exactly ONE collected
 * file names `object-metric` and `drillDown`, and it is
 * `registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts` — the ledger itself.
 *
 * `ObjectMetricWidget.i18nLabel.test.tsx` is the trap slice 8 flagged, and the
 * re-measurement corrects half of its description: it contains ZERO occurrences
 * of the string `object-metric` (control: `ObjectMetricWidget` reads 15 in the
 * same file), so it does not satisfy this repo's locator — only one keyed on
 * the key name alone. It authors `drillDown: { enabled: true }` three times,
 * purely to make the tile clickable, and its subject is `I18nLabel` resolution:
 * that an inline per-locale map reaches the drawer heading rather than
 * collapsing to the literal "Details". It asserts nothing about `enabled`'s
 * three-way reading, `target`, `report`, `drillDown.title`'s precedence, or the
 * filter the record list is scoped by — so it is not promoted, and its own
 * subject is left intact.
