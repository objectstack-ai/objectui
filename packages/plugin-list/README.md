# @object-ui/plugin-list

ListView plugin for ObjectUI - A unified view component with view type switching, filtering, sorting, and view configuration persistence.

## Features

- **View Type Switching**: Switch between Grid, Kanban, Gallery, Calendar,
  Timeline, Gantt, Map, Chart and Tree views
- **View Persistence**: Automatically saves user's view preference
- **Integrated Search**: Full-text search across records
- **Filtering**: Advanced filter UI (expandable filter panel)
- **Sorting**: Sort by any field, toggle ascending/descending
- **Flexible Configuration**: Configure available view types per object
- **Custom Templates**: Support for custom view options per view type

## Visual density defaults (renderer-only, metadata always wins)

The toolbar and cell renderers are tuned for low visual noise on dense tables:

- **Unified toolbar row**: view tabs (`schema.tabs`), user filters and tool
  buttons share a single bordered row. The previous stacked rows (`tabs` /
  `description` / `toolbar`) are collapsed into one separator line.
- **Flat user-filter pills**: `userFilters` (dropdown mode) render as ghost
  text + count. Active state is shown via `text-foreground font-medium`
  rather than a filled / bordered pill.
- **Quiet active state for tool buttons**: filter / group / sort / color /
  density / search no longer paint a `bg-primary/10 border` block when
  active — they switch to `text-foreground font-medium` and rely on the
  trailing count for emphasis.
- **Dot-style select/status cells (opt-in)**: the cell renderer supports
  `appearance: 'dot'` to render `● label` instead of a filled badge for
  high-density tables. **This is opt-in** — by default select/status
  cells render as filled badges in both list and detail views, keeping
  visual consistency across views. Set `appearance: 'dot'` on the field
  (or column) in metadata when you want the lighter style.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @object-ui/plugin-list
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```tsx
import { ListView } from '@object-ui/plugin-list';

function ContactsView() {
  return (
    <ListView
      schema={{
        type: 'list-view',
        objectName: 'contacts',
        viewType: 'grid',
        columns: ['name', 'email', 'phone', 'company'],
        sort: [{ field: 'name', order: 'asc' }],
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### Grouping Records (Airtable-style)

Group rows in grid/gallery views by one or more fields. Two equivalent shapes
are supported on the schema:

Spec-compliant: a structured `GroupingConfig` (multi-level, with per-field
options).

```tsx
import { ListView } from '@object-ui/plugin-list';

<ListView
  schema={{
    type: 'list-view',
    objectName: 'tasks',
    viewType: 'grid',
    columns: ['title', 'status', 'assignee'],
    grouping: {
      fields: [
        { field: 'status', order: 'asc', collapsed: false },
        { field: 'assignee', order: 'asc', collapsed: true },
      ],
    },
  }}
/>
```

Shorthand: a single field name, the shape the visual view-config UI emits. It is
normalized internally into the `GroupingConfig` above — an alternative to the
block before it, never a second view rendered beside it.

```tsx
import { ListView } from '@object-ui/plugin-list';

<ListView
  schema={{
    type: 'list-view',
    objectName: 'tasks',
    viewType: 'grid',
    columns: ['title', 'status'],
    groupBy: 'status',
  }}
/>
```

When both are present, `grouping` wins. End users can also add or remove
grouping fields at runtime via the Group toolbar button.

### With Multiple View Types

```tsx
import { ListView } from '@object-ui/plugin-list';

<ListView
  schema={{
    type: 'list-view',
    objectName: 'deals',
    viewType: 'kanban',
    columns: ['name', 'amount', 'stage', 'close_date'],
    options: {
      kanban: {
        groupField: 'stage',
        titleField: 'name',
      },
      calendar: {
        startDateField: 'close_date',
        titleField: 'name',
      },
      chart: {
        chartType: 'bar',
        xAxisField: 'stage',
        yAxisFields: ['amount'],
      }
    }
  }}
/>
```

### With Callbacks

```tsx
import { ListView } from '@object-ui/plugin-list';

<ListView
  schema={{
    type: 'list-view',
    objectName: 'tasks',
    columns: ['title', 'status', 'priority'],
  }}
  onViewChange={(view) => console.log('View changed to:', view)}
  onSearchChange={(search) => console.log('Search:', search)}
  onSortChange={(sort) => console.log('Sort:', sort)}
  onFilterChange={(filters) => console.log('Filters:', filters)}
/>
```

## Schema

The ListView component accepts a `ListViewSchema`, exported from
`@object-ui/types`. That type is derived from the package's zod schema — which
itself derives from `@objectstack/spec` — so it cannot drift from the protocol.
This page therefore annotates an example *against* the shipped type instead of
restating it as a second hand-written interface: every key below is re-checked
on every commit, and a shape the type stops accepting fails here rather than
misleading a reader.

```typescript
import type { ListViewSchema } from '@object-ui/types';

const view: ListViewSchema = {
  type: 'list-view',
  objectName: 'tasks',
  viewType: 'grid',
  // Spec-canonical column list. The legacy `fields` alias is still accepted on
  // input (stored view metadata carries it) and folded into `columns` by
  // `normalizeListViewSchema` — but nothing reads it, so emit `columns`.
  columns: ['title', 'status', 'assignee'],
  filters: [['status', '=', 'open']],
  sort: [{ field: 'title', order: 'asc' }],
  options: {
    grid: {},
    kanban: { groupField: 'status', titleField: 'title', cardFields: ['assignee'] },
    calendar: { startDateField: 'due_date', titleField: 'title' },
    chart: { chartType: 'bar', xAxisField: 'status', yAxisFields: ['amount'] },
  },
};

// `columns` also accepts ListColumn objects in place of the field-name strings.
const richColumns: ListViewSchema['columns'] = [
  { field: 'title', label: 'Title', width: 200 },
];

// The view-type vocabulary, written as a record keyed by the shipped union so
// this list cannot go stale: a value added to or removed from
// ListViewSchema['viewType'] fails this block.
const viewTypes: Record<NonNullable<ListViewSchema['viewType']>, string> = {
  grid: 'Rows and columns',
  kanban: 'Cards grouped into columns',
  gallery: 'Card grid',
  calendar: 'Records on a month / week calendar',
  timeline: 'Records bucketed on a date axis',
  gantt: 'Bars over a project timeline',
  map: 'Records at their geographic coordinates',
  chart: 'Aggregated bar / line / pie / area chart',
  tree: 'Hierarchical parent-child rows',
  page: 'A published page mounted in place of rows',
};

export { view, richColumns, viewTypes };
```

## Page binding — `dataSource` (referencing a saved view by name)

On a metadata page, a `list-view` component can bind its data through the spec's
per-element data source (`PageComponentSchema.dataSource`,
`ElementDataSourceSchema`) instead of spelling `objectName` and inlining the
view's configuration:

```json
{
  "type": "list-view",
  "dataSource": { "object": "account", "view": "hot", "limit": 10 }
}
```

`view` names a **saved view** of that object — either one embedded in the object
definition (`listViews`) or one created in the UI (the metadata overlay an
adapter serves from `listViews()`). Its `columns`, `filter`, `sort`, page size
and view kind are applied to the render, so a page no longer has to keep a second
copy of a view's configuration in sync with the view itself. Both the short key
(`hot`) and the qualified id (`account.hot`) resolve.

**Precedence.** `dataSource.*` keys are authoritative — the author wrote them on
this placement, and they beat the component's own same-named key. Values that
come from the named view are a *baseline*: a key written on the component itself
is more specific than the view it points at, so the component's key wins
(an empty `columns: []` counts as "not authored"). `filter` is the exception —
the spec calls `dataSource.filter` "additional filter criteria", so the
component's filter, the view's filter and the binding's filter all AND together.
A binding can narrow what the view selects, never widen it.

**An unresolvable `view` is an error, not an empty table.** If the named view
does not exist, the block renders a configuration error listing the object's
actual views, and issues no query. It deliberately does not fall back to the
object's default view: that would turn a typo into a silently *wider* answer on a
page that still looks like it works.

## Sorting (and why relational columns are not offered)

The toolbar sort becomes a server `$orderby` on the **flat field name**, so the
sort key is whatever that field stores. For a relational field
(`lookup` / `master_detail` / `user` / `tree`) that is the foreign-key **id**,
while the column shows the related record's name — the rows would come back in
an order with no visible relation to the column ("sorting is broken", from the
user's side). The server cannot order by the related name without a join, and
`objectstack#4256` settled that it will not add one.

So the sort picker withholds relational fields and says so. To sort by a related
record's name, denormalize that name onto this object as a **stored field,
written when the source changes**, then sort by that field — the remedy the
server's own refusal prescribes, in the same words the sort panel's hint uses.

**Not a formula field.** A formula value is computed on read, so no driver
materializes a column behind it, and since `objectstack#6994` the server answers
a sort that names one with a hard `400 INVALID_SORT` (before that it degraded
silently: the rows came back in an arbitrary order under a `200`, `asc` and
`desc` identical). The picker withholds formula fields for the same reason
(`objectui#4243`), so there is no formula column here to sort "like any other
text column" — the column you sort is the stored one the denormalization writes.

A field the view's CURRENT sort already uses stays listed under both rules —
relational ones labelled `(by ID)` — so existing view metadata round-trips
instead of silently losing its sort, and a sort the server would refuse can
still be edited away in the picker that otherwise hides its field.

Column-header sorting inside the grid follows the **same two rules**, because a
header click is a server `$orderby` as well whenever the grid is showing one
window of a larger collection (`objectui#3106`) — not a client-side reorder of
the loaded rows. So on that path a relational or formula column carries no
clickable header either (`objectui#3950`); offering one would have been the same
illusion through a different control.

Where the sort really does stay in the browser — inline `data`, or the grouped
view, which holds every row it groups — both kinds of header stay live and order
by the value the cell shows: the resolved label for a relational column, the
server-hydrated result for a formula one (see `getSortValue` in
`@object-ui/core`).

## View Persistence

The ListView automatically persists the user's view type preference in localStorage using the key `listview-{objectName}-view`.
