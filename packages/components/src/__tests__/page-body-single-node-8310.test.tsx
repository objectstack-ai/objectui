 * `PageRenderer` draws a `body` given as ONE node and a `body` given as a list
 * (objectui#8310, maintainer ruling 2026-09-07, director decision batch #2),
 * and the root README's flagship example draws its CHILDREN (objectui#8912).
 *
 * ## Two cards share this file, and they are not the same question
 *
 * objectui#8310 asked the ARITY of `PageNodeSchema.body` — one node, or a list.
 * objectui#8912 asked whether the child key the flagship example AUTHORS has
 * any reader at all. This file now pins both, because both are properties of
 * the same transcribed snippet, and the second was originally left visible here
 * on purpose (see "History" below) rather than repaired.
 *
 * ## What each leg is, and which one is evidence
 *
 * - **objectui#8310 — a regression CONTROL, not evidence.** The ruling's repair
 *   on this side is the deletion of `FlatContent`'s `content as SchemaNode`
 *   cast, a TYPE-LEVEL change with no runtime effect: both arities rendered
 *   before it and both render after it. An assertion green in both worlds
 *   proves nothing about a change, and it is labelled so nobody quotes it as if
 *   it did. The discriminating half lives in
 *   `packages/types/src/__tests__/page-body-arity-8310.test.ts`.
 * - **objectui#8912 — evidence, and it is RENDER OUTPUT.** The three
 *   `statistic` labels the flagship authors must appear in the rendered tree.
 *   ⛔ No compile-time check can stand in for this leg: `BaseSchema` is
 *   `.passthrough()` with an `[key: string]: any` index signature, so the
 *   defective key validated, type-checked, rode onto the node and drew nothing.
 *   `check:doc-types` only asks whether a fence's `type` literal is registered
 *   (`grid` is), and `check:doc-examples` compiles against that same index
 *   signature. Both are green on the defect BY DESIGN (objectui#4823), so a
 *   green from either is not a reading of this card.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why the negative-space leg renders the OLD spelling
 *
 * The `grid` renderer reads `schema.children` and nothing else. The third
 * describe block renders the pre-repair shape and asserts the grid element IS
 * drawn while its children are NOT — which is precisely why objectui#8912
 * failed silently, and precisely why a naive "did anything render?" control
 * passes on a broken build. It is also the floor set by coding standard #0.1
 * (contract-first): making `grid` read `items` as an alias for `children`, or
 * declaring `items` on `GridSchema`, were both REFUSED on objectui#8912 as the
 * lenient-fallback shape that standard forbids by name. Either one would redden
 * this block. ⛔ Do not "fix" it by teaching the renderer the second spelling.
 *
 * ## History — why this file once transcribed the defect on purpose
 *
 * Written for objectui#8310, when the README's flagship grid still spelled its
 * child list `items`. That defect was measured while writing this file and
 * filed as objectui#8912; the objectui#8310 ruling forbade touching the README,
 * so the transcription deliberately preserved `items` so the defect could not
 * hide inside a green. objectui#8912 has since repaired all three teaching
 * surfaces to `children`, so the transcription now follows the repaired
 * flagship — and the README-scan leg below keeps it from becoming fiction.
 * ⛔ Do not delete or weaken these legs to make an unrelated change pass.
