/**
 * An all-skipped filter constrains nothing, and says so — objectui#9020.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `convertFiltersToAST` skips a key whose value is `null` / `undefined`. That is
 * long-standing, pinned, and NOT what this card changed — the first control
 * below is that pin, restated where a reader of this file will see it. What
 * changed is the answer when the skip leaves nothing behind: the general tail
 * used to hand back the CALLER'S ORIGINAL OBJECT, which is neither an AST node
 * nor "no filter", and the two `find()` routes of `@object-ui/data-objectstack`
 * read it as two different questions. That two-route disagreement is measured in
 * `packages/data-objectstack/src/filter-all-skipped-two-routes-9020.test.ts`;
 * this file pins the converter and the two sinks that sit on top of it.
 *
 * ## Why `undefined` and not something else
 *
 * There is no other spelling. This dialect expresses "no constraint" as the
 * ABSENCE of the slot — `lowerLogicalGroup` says so for the TRUE identity, and
 * `['and']` (the "obvious" empty group) is `isFilterAST` FALSE. The two
 * candidate repairs were: make a null-valued key mean a predicate (which breaks
 * the skip pin and moves every caller's row set), or carry the skip's own
 * answer to the wire. The second is this card. An author who MEANT the
 * predicate has always been able to spell it `{ a: { $null: true } }`, and the
 * last case here pins that they still can.
 *
 * ⚠️ The same answer as objectui#8770's fold, deliberately NOT the same state.
 * That fold is objectstack#5322's ruled TRUE identity; this is this file's own
 * tolerance made self-consistent. They are counted apart in the tail, and the
 * boundary section below is what proves they were not merged.
