/**
 * objectui#11417 — a dimensioned `pie` / `donut` / `funnel` / `treemap` /
 * `sankey` with two measures draws the first, and the dropped-measure
 * diagnostic (objectui#8894) must SAY SO. What is drawn does not change.
 *
 * The chart branch of `DatasetWidget` hands every declared measure to the
 * shared chart renderer as a series, and the renderer's arms for those five
 * families bind `series[0]` and read no other series. Every door accepts the
 * document (objectui's `DashboardWidgetSchema` and `@objectstack/spec` alike),
 * the query runs both measures, and the chart looks finished while answering a
 * narrower question than its metadata asked. Triage's ruling on the card: the
 * spec refuses the shape (objectstack#21293), and until that refusal reaches
 * objectui the widget's existing diagnostic reports the dropped measure.
 *
 * The pins are triage's: for each of the five types with a dimension and two
 * measures, the diagnostic names the dropped measure; one measure stays silent
 * (the control). Beside them:
 *
 *  - a dimensioned `bar` with two measures stays silent: it draws both;
 *  - the message for this shape states the cause and points to no ADR-0087
 *    entry, because the one the tile message points to answers for a
 *    one-number tile, and a chart with a dimension is not one;
 *  - the TIE: `SINGLE_SERIES_CHART_FAMILIES` is a list kept in `DatasetWidget`,
 *    because the renderer declares no such set. So the last block renders every
 *    chart type the spec declares through the REAL renderer and measures, per
 *    type, whether the second measure reaches the drawn chart at all — and
 *    requires the diagnostic to fire exactly where it does not.
 *
 * How the tie measures "drawn": the same widget renders twice with different
 * values in the second measure. A chart that draws that measure paints
 * something different; one that drops it paints the same markup byte for byte.
 * Two controls make the reading mean something: the same values twice must give
 * the same markup (the harness is deterministic), and different values in the
 * FIRST measure must give different markup (the plot really painted — a chart
 * with no box would read "dropped" for every measure).
 *
 * No renderer stub anywhere: the chain is `DatasetWidget` → `SchemaRenderer` →
 * the registry's `chart` → `AdvancedChartImpl`, as in
 * `DatasetWidget.chartConfigMarks-9203.test.tsx`, whose scoped
 * `getBoundingClientRect` stub gives the plot its box (that file's header says
 * why a blanket stub reads wrong and why `vi.mock('recharts')` is not available
 * in this package).
 *
 * No `dist/` is involved: the root `vitest.config.mts` aliases every
 * `@object-ui/*` specifier to that package's `src/`, and this file imports
 * `../DatasetWidget` relatively, so an ablation reads source directly.
