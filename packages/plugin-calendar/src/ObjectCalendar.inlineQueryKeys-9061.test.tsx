/**
 * objectui#9061 — a `provider: 'value'` calendar honours the three query keys
 * the fetching path honours: `filter`, `sort`, and the objectui#7210 row
 * ceiling. The port of objectui#8769, which removed the same short-circuit
 * from `ObjectGantt`; `ObjectMap.inlineQueryKeys-9061.test.tsx` is the twin.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * The record-fetch effect short-circuited the inline provider
 * (`setData(dataItems)`; return) BEFORE the `find` below it, which is the ONE
 * site in the file that lowers `schema.filter` to `$filter`, `schema.sort` to
 * `$orderby` and the ceiling to `$top`. An authored `filter` therefore reached
 * nothing and every inline row was drawn — the fail-OPEN direction: the key
 * that was ignored is the key that NARROWS, so the author saw MORE events than
 * declared, with no diagnostic.
 *
 * ⛔ Not a data-exposure boundary. The rows are already in the authored schema;
 * what is wrong is that the calendar answers a question nobody asked.
 *
 * ## The two-sided reading is the finding
 *
 * A one-sided reproduction cannot tell "the filter was ignored" from "the
 * filter matched everything", so `twoSidedFilter` renders the SAME rows and the
 * SAME filter twice — once inline, once through a context adapter that is
 * itself a `ValueDataSource` over those rows — and reads the DISAGREEMENT. The
 * matcher is literally the same implementation on both sides, so the only
 * variable left is which branch of the effect ran.
 *
 * ## ORDER: filter first, ceiling second (objectui#7210 ruling a′)
 *
 * The ceiling is applied to the FILTERED set, matching the fetching path, where
 * `$filter` and `$top` travel in one query and every backend filters before it
 * limits. `ceilingOrder` pins it from the observable side: a set that is over
 * the ceiling BEFORE filtering and under it after draws every matching row and
 * shows NO footnote.
 *
 * ## What this repair does NOT inherit from the gantt
 *
 * `ObjectGantt` had a standing pin asserting an inline set is never capped and
 * never footnoted, which objectui#8769 had to invert. `ObjectCalendar` has no
 * such pin — `ObjectCalendar.rowCeiling-7210.test.tsx` grades the `object`
 * provider only — so the ceiling rows below are NEW coverage rather than an
 * inversion. Verified by reading that file's case list before writing this one.
 *
 * ⚠️ MEASURED CONSEQUENCE, reported rather than hidden: an author who supplies
 * more than `NON_GRID_ROW_CEILING` inline rows now sees fewer events than they
 * supplied. `ceilingCap` and `ceilingNote` are that measurement. It is the
 * ruled behaviour rather than a silent loss — ruling a′'s budget is measured in
 * DOM ELEMENTS PER RECORD and its own table was taken over the inline `value`
 * provider, and `NonGridRowCeilingNote` names BOTH numbers on screen, which is
 * the half the ruling actually protects. The calendar is the view where a cut
 * is hardest to see from the picture (a month grid draws at most four events
 * per day cell), so the footnote is the whole signal and `ceilingNote` is not
 * optional.
 *
 * ## HOW THE INLINE ROWS ARE SPELLED HERE, and why it is not the map's spelling
 *
 * `staticData`, on every row. Rung 1 of the record-source ladder is judged
 * against the BLOCK's own published `data` row (objectui#8348, decision batch
 * #83 — "the row decides"), and `object-calendar`'s row is
 * `z.array(z.unknown()).optional()` — an ARRAY. A `{ provider, items }` config
 * object under `data` is therefore refused BY KIND on this block, the ladder
 * falls through to a `staticData` and an `objectName` that are not there, and
 * the calendar is left with no record source at all. `offArmDataSpelling` pins
 * exactly that, with a lit control beside it.
 *
 * ⚠️ The twin file `ObjectMap.inlineQueryKeys-9061.test.tsx` is the MIRROR
 * IMAGE, not a copy: `object-map`'s row is `ViewData`, so there the config
 * object is the honoured spelling and the bare array is the refused one. The
 * two files use opposite spellings on purpose; copying either one's `data:`
 * line into the other is the defect each file's off-arm row exists to catch.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted BEFORE running, from the committed
 * fix, by restoring the short-circuit in `ObjectCalendar.tsx` ONLY (the map's
 * fix left in place): `twoSidedFilter`, `inlineSort`, `ceilingCap`,
 * `ceilingNote` and `ceilingOrder` go RED; `control`, `offArmDataSpelling` and
 * `providerBackedControl` stay GREEN — the first draws the same rows in the
 * same order either way, the second never reaches the inline branch, and the
 * third never touches the inline path at all, which is what makes them
 * controls.
