/**
 * objectui#6576 — the two widget prop types that declared their `schema` as a
 * hand-rolled inline object literal are anchored to NAMED schema types that
 * `extends BaseSchema` (maintainer ruling 2026-08-31, option A). Folds
 * objectui#6914: `ObjectDataTableSchema` declares the two keys the widget was
 * reading behind casts.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `ObjectGalleryProps.schema` (plugin-list) and `ObjectDataTableProps.schema`
 * (plugin-dashboard) were the ONLY two `Object*Props` in the repo whose
 * `schema` member anchored to no named type at all. Because nothing in their
 * ancestry reached `BaseSchema`, none of its declared members existed on them —
 * every base key an author may legitimately write had to be hand-copied into
 * the literal (`bind`, `className` were), and the two literals disagreed on
 * strictness: the gallery had no index signature and REJECTED `visibleWhen`,
 * a real base member, as an unknown key; the data-table carried its own
 * `[key: string]: any` and had already drifted — it read `drillDown` and
 * `onRowClick` and declared neither (objectui#6914).
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and where the rest lives
 *
 * 1. TYPE-LEVEL, on the two new declarations in this package: both extend
 *    `BaseSchema`, carry the widget's registry key as their `type` literal,
 *    inherit the base members with their DECLARED types (not `any`), and
 *    `ObjectDataTableSchema` declares `drillDown` / `onRowClick` with the exact
 *    types measured where they were declared before (`DrillDownConfig` on
 *    `ChartSchema` / `PivotTableSchema`; `onRowClick` on `DataTableSchema`).
 *    `tsconfig.test.json` compiles this file, so these are real enforcement.
 * 2. SOURCE-LEVEL, on the two widget files: `schema:` anchors to the named type,
 *    no inline `schema: {` literal remains, the local `bind` re-declaration and
 *    the data-table's own index signature are gone, and the two #6914 casts are
 *    gone with them. Read off disk the way `base-bind-declared.test.ts` reads
 *    its readers — this package cannot import the plugins.
 * 3. DRIFT, the objectui#6170 / #6357 class the inline shape invited: every key
 *    a widget reads off `schema` is a key its zod mirror declares — both
 *    widgets in ONE run so each is the other's control. The single deliberate
 *    exception is ledgered by name below and in `zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`.
 *
 * The anchoring of each PROP type to its schema type is pinned where it can be
 * compiled — beside the widget:
 * `plugin-list/src/__tests__/ObjectGallery.schemaAnchor-6576.test.ts` and
 * `plugin-dashboard/src/__tests__/ObjectDataTable.schemaAnchor-6576.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## The ceiling, stated rather than assumed (objectui#5155)
 *
 * `BaseSchema` still carries `[key: string]: any`, so anchoring buys DECLARED
 * members their declared types (`visible: 42` is refused on both widgets now)
 * but does NOT buy rejection of a misspelling: `visibleWhn` compiles on both.
 * The ruling accepted that cost knowingly; the counter-probe below pins it
 * honestly so nobody reads the anchor as more than it is. When objectui#5155
 * lands, that expectation is the one to revisit deliberately.
