 * `filterBindings`. At render time the dashboard broadcasts the filter

 *
 * **What it is.** `defaultValue: { preset: 'last_7_days' }` on a `type: 'date'`
 * filter. The canonical spelling is the bare preset NAME,
 * `defaultValue: 'last_7_days'` — one of the three the spec's rc.6 refinement
 * accepts (preset name / ISO date / date-macro token).
 *
 * **Why it is lifted here rather than tolerated.** Maintainer ruling on
 * objectui#4165 (2026-08-11): 「spec stays strict — no widening」. objectui's
 * `GlobalFilterSchema` now carries that refinement, so a document holding the
 * object form fails validation; lifting it BEFORE anything reads the entry
 * makes the declaration canonical by construction. The lift itself lives in
 * `@object-ui/types`' `dashboard-filter-alias.ts` (one implementation, shared
 * with the designer's rewrite-on-save path); this is one of its two call sites.
 *
 * **What it does NOT buy, measured.** It does not rescue rendering. A legacy
 * declaration already resolved correctly before #4165 and still does with this
 * call deleted — reverse-verified, only the warning below changes. The reason
 * is a coincidence worth knowing: `{ preset }` is also the runtime VALUE shape
 * `normalizeDateDefault` produces for the canonical name, and that function
 * passes non-strings through untouched. That coincidence is why the object form
 * looked harmless for so long, and how the schema's own prose drifted into
 * calling it "the on-disk form". Read this call as canonicalization plus
 * observability, not as a repair — claiming more would be claiming coverage the
 * tests in `__tests__/dashboard-filters.test.ts` do not have.
 *
 * **When it may be removed.** At the next MAJOR of `@object-ui/types` (18.0.0).
 * By then every dashboard opened in the designer has been rewritten to the bare
 * name, because `DashboardDesignPage` lifts into the editable draft and the
 * next save persists it. Delete this function and its call below together with
 * the lift itself; a document still carrying the object form then gets the
 * spec's named rejection, which is the intended end state.
 *
 * The warning is not decoration: a silent lift can never be retired, because
 * nothing would ever show that the last legacy document is gone (ADR-0078 —

/**
 * Normalize a date filter's DECLARED default into the `DateRangeValue` shape
 * every date consumer in this module reads (framework#4475).
 *
 * ## Declaration space vs value space — the distinction objectui#4165 turned on
 *
 * These are two different things that share the name `defaultValue`, and
 * conflating them is what produced #4165:
 *
 *  - the **declaration** is `globalFilters[].defaultValue` in a stored
 *    dashboard. `@objectstack/spec` owns it, it is `string | number | boolean`,
 *    and since rc.6 a refinement holds a `type: 'date'` one to a preset NAME,
 *    an ISO date or a date-macro token. A bare preset name is the canonical
 *    spelling and the object form is a retiring alias (see
 *    `liftLegacyFilterDeclaration` above);
 *  - the **value** is what this function RETURNS: `DashboardFilterDef
 *    .defaultValue`, which seeds the filter variable and is read by
 *    `DateRangeFilter` (`.preset`/`.from`/`.to`) and `buildFilterCondition`.
 *    That shape is `DateRangeValue`, it is objectui-internal, the spec has no
 *    opinion about it, and for a preset it is `{ preset }`.
 *
 * So this function converts declaration → value. It is NOT a producer of stored
 * metadata: nothing writes a resolved `DashboardFilterDef` back into a
 * dashboard document (measured in #4165 — `resolveDashboardFilterDefs`' only
 * callers are `DashboardRenderer` and `DashboardWidgetInspector`, both read
 * side). Making it emit the bare name instead would therefore not change one
 * byte on disk; it would only hand `DateRangeFilter` a string it cannot read
 * and `buildFilterCondition` a value it warns-and-skips — i.e. re-open
 * framework#4475 exactly, which is why it keeps emitting `{ preset }`.
 *
 * The built-in `dateRange` declaration has always been normalized this way —
 * `schema.dateRange.defaultRange` is a preset NAME and
 * `resolveDashboardFilterDefs` lifts it to `{ preset }`. A `globalFilters`
 * entry of `type: 'date'` was passed through raw instead, and that asymmetry
 * is the whole bug: `@objectstack/spec`'s `GlobalFilterSchema.defaultValue` is
 * `string | number | boolean`, so a bare preset name is the ONLY spelling an
 * author can write, yet nothing ever mapped it. Both symptoms of Setup's
 * System Overview reading 0 across every KPI tile follow from that:
 *
 *  - `buildFilterCondition` fell through to its "a bare string date means
 *    equality on that day" branch and emitted `created_at = 'last_7_days'`,
 *    which matches no row — a query the backend answers `200 OK` with a 0;
 *  - `DateRangeFilter` reads `value.preset` / `.from` / `.to`, all `undefined`
 *    on a bare string, so the control displayed "All time" while sending that
 *    equality — the tiles looked deliberately unfiltered and merely empty.
 *
 * Only a name this module actually knows is lifted. A genuine ISO date string
 * still means equality on that day (the documented behaviour), and a number /
 * boolean / unrecognised string is left exactly as declared — an unrecognised
 * string then never reaches a query at all: `buildFilterCondition` skips it
 * with a warning rather than comparing a column against it (#3151).

 * is still lifted, but is DEPRECATED and now says so out loud. Rendering an
 * un-normalized option crashes React — this is the single place both shapes
 * converge.
 *
 * ## The shorthand's deprecation (objectui#4356, objectstack#7917)
 *
 * Maintainer ruling of 2026-08-12 on objectstack#7917, verbatim 「7917 ②」:
 * option ② — **the spec stays strict; the runtime bare-string lift retires
 * behind a deprecation window sized by a stored-dashboard survey.** So a
 * document spelling `options: ['EMEA']` renders here and is refused the moment
 * it reaches the platform's validation — the "one strict contract beats N
 * dialects" divergence AGENTS.md #0.1 names, with the renderer's tolerance
 * acting as a second de-facto contract.
 *
 * This is the WARN half of that window (Phase 1). The lift itself is unchanged
 * and remains mechanically lossless (`'EMEA'` → `{ value: 'EMEA', label:
 * 'EMEA' }`), because stored dashboards carry the shorthand and dropping it
 * silently would turn a rendering filter into an empty one. Removal (Phase 2)
 * is scheduled on objectstack#7917, earliest one minor release after this ships
 * and not before the live-tenant channel has actually been queried.
 *
 * The warning is not decoration: a silent lift can never be retired, because
 * nothing would ever show that the last shorthand document is gone (ADR-0078 —
 * nothing silently inert). It is the same reasoning `liftLegacyFilterDeclaration`
 * records above, for the sibling alias.
 *
 * Phase 0 shipped in the same PR: objectui's own docs, its `plugin-dashboard`
 * README and its schema-catalog corpus stopped TEACHING the shorthand, so the
 * stored population is no longer growing while this warning asks authors to
 * migrate. Warning authors while the docs still taught the form would have been
 * a contradiction users report as a bug.
 *
 * ## What is normalized, and what is deliberately NOT (objectui#4032 / #4163)
 *
 * The PAIR SHAPE is normalized (`value` stringified, a bare string lifted to a
 * pair). The LABEL's authoring vocabulary is carried through untouched, because
 * `label` is `I18nLabel` — a string OR an inline per-locale map.
 *
 * This line used to read:
 *
 * ```ts
 * label: typeof label === 'string' && label ? label : String(value),
 * ```
 *
 * which looks like defensive normalization and is data loss. An option authored
 * `{ value: 'domestic', label: { en: 'Domestic', 'zh-CN': '国内' } }` normalized
 * to `label: 'domestic'` — the raw STORED VALUE — so the control lost the
 * authored text in *every* locale, English included. Nothing downstream could
 * recover it: by the time a renderer saw the def, the map was gone.
 *
 * A map is therefore preserved and the render side resolves it against the
 * active language. Anything that is neither a string nor an object is not a
 * label in any vocabulary the spec admits, and still falls back to the value.
