/**
 * FlowNodeInspector — scoped editor for the selected flow node.
 *
 * Selection shape:  { kind: 'node', id: <nodeId> }         — a top-level node
 *                   { kind: 'nested-node', id: <path> }    — a node inside a
 *                     container region (loop/parallel/try_catch, #2670)
 * Patches:          via `locateFlowNode(...).write` — top-level nodes splice
 *                   `draft.nodes[i]`; nested nodes rebuild the container's
 *                   `config.<region>.nodes[i]` with explicit spreads.
 *
 * Both share the SAME schema-driven form. Beyond id / label / type, each node
 * type exposes a set of typed form fields (see
 * `flow-node-config`, or the engine-published configSchema) that edit scalar
 * keys on `node.config`; remaining keys go to an "Advanced (JSON)" block so
 * authors are never locked out. A nested node is edit-only this phase: its id is
 * read-only, it has no delete, and (for a nested decision) the virtual Target
 * column is dropped — region-internal routing is not managed here.

 * The node and edge shapes this panel edits — ALIASED, never restated

 *
 * Both used to be hand-written copies here, and both had already drifted from
 * the declarations they duplicate:
 *
 * - the node copy declared `description?: string`, a key `FlowNodeSchema`
 *   refuses by name (`.strict()`, objectstack#4001) — and the copy was not even
 *   the type the panel reads through, since `locateFlowNode` returns
 *   `InspectorFlowNode`. Narrowing the copy alone would have changed nothing.
 * - the edge copy still spelled `condition?: unknown`, months after
 *   `FlowEdgeInspector`'s twin was narrowed to the spec's `ExpressionInput`
 *   because the loose spelling described an envelope the server rejects — the
 *   over-wide read type that got objectui#3171 filed against a defect that does
 *   not reproduce (objectui#3202).
 *
 * `FlowPreview.tsx` made exactly this move for its own pair, and its comment is
 * about this one: "two copies of one shape is how the wrong one survives being
 * fixed". Aliasing costs nothing at runtime — both imports are `import type`,
 * erased at compile time, and `flow-canvas-layout` is dependency-free by design.
 * `flow-designer-edge.types.test.ts` already pins the edge condition against the
 * spec, so this panel now inherits that pin instead of needing its own copy of
 * it.
