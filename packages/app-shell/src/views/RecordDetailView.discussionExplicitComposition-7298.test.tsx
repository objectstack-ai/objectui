 * A record page shows a discussion panel IF AND ONLY IF it composes one
 * (objectui#7298 half two, maintainer ruling 2026-09-12, decision batch #120
 * item 5)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `RecordDetailView` used to append a discussion panel to any authored record
 * page that omitted `record:discussion` / `record:chatter`, and the only way to
 * decline it was `assignedPage.disableDiscussion = true` — a key `PageSchema`
 * is a `strictObject` about, so authoring it is a hard parse error. The panel
 * the host appended was hard-coded open for writes (comment input, reactions,
 * threading), which is why a deliberately read-only page over a
 * `protection: { lock: 'full' }` platform object could not decline it at all.
 *
 * The ruling removes the append rather than declaring the negative flag: *"a
 * page is what its author composes … nothing is appended by default and then
 * removed by a negative flag."* So:
 *
 *   DECLARED     the page places `record:discussion` (or `record:chatter`, the
 *                same renderer under a Salesforce-familiar alias) → the panel
 *                renders, on the config the author wrote.
 *   NOT DECLARED nothing renders. No panel, no composer, no host fallback.
 *   FEEDS OFF    `enable.feeds: false` is still the OBJECT's switch and it wins
 *                over the page: declared or not, no panel.
 *
 * ## What keeps the negative pin from passing trivially
 *
 * "No panel rendered" is satisfied by any harness in which the panel could
 * never have rendered — a broken feed read, a page that never resolved, a
 * component that throws. Every negative case below is therefore paired with a
 * LIT CONTROL that differs from it in exactly one way (the page declares the
 * node) and asserts the panel IS there, on the same fixture, in the same file:
 *
 *   `no panel without the node`      ⟷ `the declared node renders the panel`
 *   `feeds off suppresses it`        ⟷ `feeds on renders the empty panel`
 *
 * ⚠️ The feeds-off pair cannot be read on feed ROWS: `enable.feeds: false` also
 * skips the `sys_comment` fetch, so both sides would have zero rows for two
 * different reasons. It is read on the panel's own chrome — the "Discussion"
 * heading, its empty state and the composer — which is present whenever the
 * panel mounts, empty feed or not.
 *
 * ## Resolution
 *
 * Nothing here resolves through any `dist/`: `./RecordDetailView` is this
 * package's own source and `@object-ui/plugin-detail` is mapped to its `src` by
 * the root `vitest.config.mts` alias table.
