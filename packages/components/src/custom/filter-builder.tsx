/**
 * Operator ids the dropdown draws ONLY when the consumer names them in
 * `extraOperators`. Every other id in `defaultOperators` is offered to every
 * consumer.
 *
 * ## Why an operator would ever be opt-in (objectui#4023, objectui#4736)
 *
 * This one dropdown feeds three different at-rest dialects, and they do not
 * accept the same operators:
 *
 *   - **MongoDB-style `FieldOperatorsSchema` criteria** — what
 *     `FilterConditionField` writes into a sharing rule's `criteria_json`,
 *     evaluated by the server's engine. Its vocabulary is the spec's
 *     `FILTER_OPERATORS`, the widest of the three.
 *   - **`ViewFilterRule[]`** — what `viewFilterFold` persists for a saved view,
 *     and what the Studio inspector's `FilterBuilderField` writes. Its
 *     vocabulary is the spec's `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATORS`; a rule outside that
 *     enum is refused by `ViewFilterRuleSchema`.
 *   - **The array/triplet filter AST** — what `ListView` sends for the live
 *     grid, via `mapOperator`. Its vocabulary is the spec's
 *     `VALID_AST_OPERATORS`; an unmapped operator is emitted verbatim and the
 *     query comes back broken (see
 *     `packages/data-objectstack/src/filter-operator-ast-parity.test.ts` for
 *     what "broken" costs — an unfiltered read or a 400, either way not the
 *     filter the user asked for).
 *
 * So an operator only one dialect can carry is offered only by the consumer
 * that speaks that dialect. Mapping it onto a near-equivalent in the others is
 * NOT the alternative: that is a different question silently answered — the
 * same reason `view-operator-builder-parity.test.ts` refuses to map `is_null`
 * onto `isEmpty`.
 *
 * Which side of the line an id falls on is not left to this comment.
 * `plugin-list`'s `list-offered-operator-expressible-parity.test.ts` forces the
 * set the list toolbar offers to EQUAL the set its two dialects can express, in
 * both directions: an unexpressible id that stays offered fails, and an id that
 * becomes expressible while still withheld fails too.
 *
 * ### `containsCaseInsensitive` — the spec's `$icontains` (objectui#4023)
 *
 * Carried by the Mongo criteria dialect, where every driver and evaluation face
 * the platform ships executes it (objectstack#5702 + objectstack#6520). The
 * other two vocabularies have no case-insensitive contains at all, so offering
 * it everywhere is the exact hazard objectui#4023 was held blocked over,
 * relocated from the drivers to this repo's own bridges.
 *
 * ### `exists` / `notExists` — the spec's `$exists` (objectui#4736)
 *
 * Added by objectui#2942 to make `$exists` reachable from
 * `FilterConditionField`, but offered to every consumer, including the two that
 * cannot store them. Measured on `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0-rc.6: neither
 * `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATORS` nor `VALID_AST_OPERATORS` contains an existence
 * operator — not under this spelling, not under any other; both sets have ZERO
 * members matching `/exist/`. So there was nothing to map onto and the id went
 * out verbatim.
 *
 * Collapsing them onto `isNotNull` / `isNull` would be a semantic claim, not a
 * bridge, and it is refused on three counts:
 *
 *   1. The builder already offers `isNull` / `isNotNull` as their own rows, so
 *      the collapse would draw two labels for one wire predicate.
 *   2. The round trip is lossy: a saved `exists` reads back through
 *      `specToBuilderOperator('is_not_null')` as `isNotNull`, silently
 *      rewriting the author's choice on reopen.
 *   3. The equivalence is not this repo's to declare. `@objectstack/spec`'s own
 *      `data/index.d.ts` records `$exists` = has-value (`!= null`) as settled
 *      and shipped on `formula` and `driver-memory`'s reference matcher, while
 *      `driver-memory`'s live mingo path and `driver-mongodb` still read
 *      KEY-PRESENCE, both frozen by objectstack#5499 — which is why upstream
 *      cannot enrol a `$exists` conformance row yet either.
 *
 * The lasting fix for both families is upstream — the view and AST vocabularies
 * gaining the operator — at which point the entry below is deleted, the parity
 * test flips it back on by itself, and the operator becomes ordinary.

 * `{ operator: 'equals', value: '' }` and the operator dropdown preserves
 * `value`, so picking **Is null** as the first action left `value: ''` — the

 * all while the panel showed one. Silent, and every record came back.
 *
 * `exists` / `notExists` stay listed even though `OPT_IN_OPERATORS` withholds
 * them from most consumers (objectui#4736): the builder still draws them

 * the field used to write `{ field }` alone, so the row's operator survived

 *      EMITS is byte-identical — contrast the value select above, where
 *      objectui#4874 ruling C mounts the outside-options value as its own
 *      option. That answer is right there and wrong here: the value's domain is
 *      the author's data, while the operator's domain is a declared vocabulary,
 *      and mounting a foreign spelling would admit a second one;
 *   3. it does not widen what any schema ACCEPTS.
 *
 * Safe to compare through because the fold is INJECTIVE over this builder's

 * — so no two OFFERED operators can collapse onto one another and the match is

 *     precisely what objectui#4781 ruled against.
 *
 *     Since objectui#4875 the three KEYED paths in this file read through here
 *     too — `MultiValueInput`'s `commit`, the range's `setBound`, and the
 *     single input's `handleValueChange` — so the file holds ONE answer to "is
 *     this string a number" instead of a strict one for field switches beside a
 *     lenient one for typing. What each does with an unreadable string is still
 *     its own question, and they answer it differently on purpose (clear, clear,
 *     decline-and-keep-the-draft); what none of them may do is invent a number.
 *     That convergence is drift insurance rather than a live repair: all three
 *     sit behind `<input type="number">`, which hands back `""` for anything
 *     non-numeric, so the lenient branch was unreachable while it existed. The
 *     day one of them becomes a text box — formulas, variables, a paste path —
 *     the strict reading is already the one in force.
 *   - **boolean** — only the two words the row can round-trip back out of a
 *     boolean column (`"true"` / `"false"`, trimmed, case-insensitively).
 *     `1` / `0` / `"yes"` are conventions, not readings, so they clear.
 *   - **date / datetime / time** — only a value the target's own input can
 *     render as-is, plus the one truncation that loses nothing that input could
 *     have shown anyway (a zoneless timestamp → its date). Everything else
 *     clears, which is the ruling's default:
 *       - `date` ← `"2024-03-05"` as-is, `"2024-03-05T14:30"` → `"2024-03-05"`;
 *       - `datetime` ← a zoneless `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm[:ss]` as-is. A bare date
 *         does NOT convert: appending midnight would invent the half of the
 *         value the user never gave, and `equals 2024-03-05T00:00` is a filter
 *         that silently matches almost nothing — worse than an empty input;
 *       - `time` ← `HH:mm[:ss]` as-is. A timestamp does NOT convert: a
 *         time-of-day column asks a different question than an instant does.
 *     A zone-carrying string (`…Z`, `…+08:00`) clears everywhere: no input here
 *     can render it, and truncating it by hand is exactly the ambiguity the
 *     ruling says to refuse.
 *   - **text** — holds everything, so nothing clears; a non-string is written
 *     out with `String()` so the row's value is typed for the column it now
 *     filters (`42` → `"42"`, `true` → `"true"`).
 *
 * The empty scalar `""` is returned unchanged by every family: an unfilled row
 * is already in the family's empty shape, and "clearing" it would be a no-op
 * dressed as a decision.

 * the type: the value input is re-drawn from the NEW field's type, and an
 * `<input type="number">` renders a non-numeric value as BLANK. So a `text`
 * row filtered `equals "acme"`, pointed at a number column, showed an empty box
 * while the row went on carrying `"acme"` — `foldFilterGroupToSpecRules`
 * persisted it and the live grid queried `amount equals "acme"`. The same
 * invisible-value shape objectui#4768 closed on the operator, one column over.
 *
 * Carry-if-possible, exactly as `reshapeFilterValue` carries what it can across
 * a family change: `"42"` moved to a number column becomes `42` and survives;
 * `"acme"` cannot be read as a number by any clean reading, so it clears to the
 * family's empty shape — scalar `""`, list `[]`, pair `[]`. What a value can
 * become is decided in one place, {@link convertScalarToFamily}.
 *
 * The arity is read from the operator through the same `filterValueArity` fold
 * the rest of this component uses, because each shape clears differently:
 *
 *   - `scalar` — converted, or `""`.
 *   - `list` — converted ENTRY BY ENTRY, keeping the ones that carry:
 *     `["42", "acme"]` → `[42]`, and `[]` when none do. Reachable today only
 *     between the two buckets that offer `in`/`notIn` (`select` ↔ `lookup`),
 *     which are both text-family, so the conversion is the identity there; it
 *     is written for the family the operator lands in rather than for today's
 *     buckets, and pinned directly on this helper.
 *   - `pair` — both bounds converted independently, an unconvertible bound
 *     becoming `""` so the range keeps its two slots; both empty collapses to
 *     `[]`, the "not filled in yet" shape `reshapeFilterValue` also produces

 * `false` (a **remote/async** column): the domain lives on the server. Three
 * ways to land here, all meaning "the local option set cannot vouch for this

 *
 *   - `options` **absent** — the shape a lookup with `referenceTo` arrives in;
 *   - `options: []` — **present but not yet loaded**. Not hypothetical:

 * drawn for it" and "may a value be cleared against it" — are answered from one
 * place. They used to disagree: that branch spelled the test `!field?.options`,
 * which is `false` for `options: []`, so a lookup whose options had not arrived
 * was handed the static Select (empty, no search box) by one answer while this
 * one called it remote and kept its value.
 *
 * For those, the ruling is the other half: never clear on a local non-membership
 * guess (a valid lookup id is not the local page's to delete), and never leave
 * the value invisible — which the render path answers unconditionally by

 * read as complete, and both consumers carried it through. The live grid then
 * queried a range with an empty upper bound and the server refused the whole
 * view (`400 INVALID_FILTER`), which is the "该视图的查询被拒绝" the reporter
 * hit; the saved-view path persisted the same half-range, so the refusal came
 * back on every later read of that view.
 *
 * The spec cannot catch this on the way past — measured against
 * `ViewFilterRuleSchema` on `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0: `["2024-01-01", ""]` is
 * ACCEPTED (it counts the two slots, not what is in them), while a scalar or a

 * validation and only dies at query time, one layer too late to be actionable.

 * decides when a row is finished, exactly as it already decides which operators
 * finish with no value at all ({@link VALUELESS_FILTER_BUILDER_OPERATORS}), and

 * disagree in the first place.
 *
 * The arity is read through the same `filterValueArity` fold the rest of this
 * file uses, so a stored rule spelled canonically gets the same answer as the
 * dropdown's own id.
 *
 * What each shape needs:
 *
 *   - `pair` — BOTH bounds present. A range missing an end is not a narrower
 *     range, it is a query the server refuses.
 *   - `list` — at least one entry; `[]` is the "nothing chosen yet" shape.
 *   - `scalar` — anything that is not the unfilled shape.
 *
 * "Present" is {@link isValueUnset}, never `!bound` (objectui#4873): `0` is a
 * real bound on a number column and `false` is a real value, and reading either
 * as unfilled would drop a filter the user can see on screen.
 *
 * This answers the VALUE question only. Whether an operator wants a value at all
 * stays with each caller, because the two layers see different vocabularies:
 * `app-shell` also has to recognise the canonical spellings (`is_null`) that
 * never reach this dropdown.

   *      that type cannot hold is a value the user can no longer see or edit
   *      while the row keeps filtering by it. Convertible values are carried
   *      (`"42"` → `42`); the rest clear.
   *   3. `narrowFilterValueToOptions` — the DOMAIN the new field offers, for the
   *      columns whose whole domain is local. Step 2 stops at the type, and
   *      `select`/`lookup` are text-family: `"acme"` is a string a picklist
   *      column can HOLD but not one of its options, and its Select shows only
   *      what an option carries. Remote/async columns are left alone here on
