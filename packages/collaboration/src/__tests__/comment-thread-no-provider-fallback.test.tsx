/**
 * Every string objectstack#5506 / objectui#3424 moved into the locale packs
 * still resolves to ENGLISH when no `I18nProvider` is mounted.
 *
 * `CommentThread` is exported for standalone use and its host may mount no
 * ObjectUI shell at all. Routing a literal through `t()` without a working
 * default is exactly how a label turns into a raw dotted key
 * (`collaboration.reply`) in someone else's app — and it would do so silently,
 * because `fallbackLng: 'en'` never fires when there is no i18next instance to
 * fall back inside of. `COLLAB_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS` is the thing that has to
 * hold, and this file is what holds it.
 *
 * ── Directions: predicted first, then corrected by the run ────────────────
 * **Every** assertion in this file is GREEN on BOTH sides of the change.
 * That is the invariant, not a missing test: the English copy is supposed to
 * be byte-identical before and after, so a flip would mean the copy moved.
 * What this file catches is a break introduced by *this* change — a key wired
 * into the component but missing (or mis-spelled) in
 * `COLLAB_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS` goes red here and nowhere else.
 *
 * One prediction was wrong and is recorded rather than dropped: the singular
 * comment count was expected to be red-before, on the assumption that the
 * header glued a bare `s` on with no singular branch — the way `page:tabs`'
 * badge did in objectui#3423 ("1 items"). `origin/main` in fact reads
 * `` `${n} comment${n !== 1 ? 's' : ''}` `` and already produced correct
 * English, so that case is green on both sides like the rest. The real defect
 * in those two sites is that the plural RULE was compiled into the component
 * and no locale could apply its own; the `de` cases in
 * `comment-thread-i18n.test.tsx` are what pin that.
 *
 * ── Why this is its own FILE, not a describe block ────────────────────────
 * `createI18n` calls `instance.use(initReactI18next)`, and `initReactI18next`
 * registers that instance as **react-i18next's module-global default**. The
 * registration survives unmount and `cleanup()`. So the moment any test in a
 * file mounts `<I18nProvider config={{ defaultLanguage: 'zh' }}>`, every later
 * "no provider" render in that same file silently resolves against the Chinese
 * instance — a file that looks green while asserting nothing about the
 * fallback, or a baffling red where a provider-less thread renders 中文.
 *
 * Vitest's `dom` project runs with `isolate: true`, so a file that never mounts
 * a provider gets a genuinely clean global. Keep it that way: **do not import
 * or mount `I18nProvider` here.** (Importing `@object-ui/i18n` for a pure
 * helper would be safe — nothing calls `createI18n` at module scope — but the
 * cheapest way to keep that true is to not import it at all.)
