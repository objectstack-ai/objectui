/**
 * FlowReferenceField — an *editable combobox* for flow-node config values that
 * are really references (an object's field, an object/flow/role/user/… by name,
 * a connector, an email template, or another node in this flow) rather than
 * free-form strings.
 *
 * Why a combobox and not a strict dropdown: the designer must never trap the
 * author. The control suggests known values (fetched per {@link ReferenceKind})
 * but always accepts free text, so a field that doesn't exist yet or an empty
 * catalog still let the author type a value. Implemented with a native
 * `<datalist>` for exactly that suggest-but-allow-anything behaviour, zero
 * extra dependencies, and built-in accessibility.
 *
 * Four kinds carry a stronger contract than suggest-and-allow-anything
 * (framework #3508): the directory-backed kinds (`user`/`team`/`department`/
 * `position`) render a record lookup against the data API (with a manual-entry
 * escape hatch, so the never-trap rule still holds), `org-membership-level` is
 * a strict select over a closed enum, `manager` is auto-resolved (disabled
 * cell), and `queue` warns that the runtime doesn't resolve it.
 *
 * Two layers:
 *   • {@link ReferenceCombobox} — the bare control, given an already-resolved
 *     concrete kind. Reused by the `objectList` repeater for per-row reference
 *     cells (e.g. an approver's value).
 *   • {@link FlowReferenceField} — the inspector field wrapper (label + hint),
 *     resolving a *polymorphic* reference against the node's own sibling config.
 *
 * Data sources are resolved lazily from the running backend (the same source of
 * truth as the rest of the designer); `object-field` additionally needs to know
 * *which* object — resolved from the reference's `objectSource` against the
 * flow draft (trigger object) or the node's sibling config.
