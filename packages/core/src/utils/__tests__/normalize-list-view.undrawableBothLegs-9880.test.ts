/**
 * objectui#9880 — the two view-kind tables in `normalize-list-view.ts` have to
 * be total against TWO different `ViewType` unions at once:
 *
 *   · the `@objectstack/spec` this repository RESOLVES today, which still
 *     publishes the list-view kind `page`;
 *   · a spec built from objectstack `main`, which RETIRED it (objectstack#17063,
 *     ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove) and which objectui#9860's shape gate compiles
 *     this repository against on every pull request.
 *
 * The spelling that failed was the ANNOTATION
 * `Record<Exclude<ViewType, ListViewVisualization>, string | null>` on the
 * undrawable table. An annotated object literal is exact in BOTH directions, so
 * the day the kind left the union its row became an excess property — TS2353,
 * the one diagnostic that gate reported on its first run — and the only repair
 * the annotation admits is DELETING the row, which the resolved published spec
 * forbids because an author can still write a `page` view against it.
 *
 * ⭐ The card's first deliverable was the judgement "is a both-legs spelling
 * possible at all", with a re-grade switch if it was not. It is: keep the
 * value constraint with `satisfies`, drop the exactness, and derive the
 * undrawable union from the table's keys INTERSECTED with the live vocabulary
 * (`Extract`), so a retired row is inert rather than illegal. This file pins
 * that judgement in both directions, with the failing spelling kept as a firing
 * control so the green below can never be the green of a check that stopped
 * checking.
 *
 * ⚠️ Only ONE spec is installed in any single run, so the two legs cannot both
 * be observed at runtime here. The vocabulary is therefore SIMULATED for the
 * type-level half — the same two operators in the same composition, applied to
 * a published-shaped union, a main-shaped one, and a grown one. The real
 * module's own cross-leg invariants are asserted separately below, and they are
 * written to hold identically under either spec; the two-spec compile itself
 * lives in this card's pull request, where both legs were run.
