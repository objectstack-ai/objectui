/**
 * Cross-file line-address citation census (objectui#8875).
 *
 * ## What this answers, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * objectui#7853 ruled the class -- CITE THE ASSERTION BY CONTENT, NOT BY LINE
 * ADDRESS. objectui#8047 mechanized it as the `no-line-address-in-test-name`
 * ESLint rule, but for TEST NAMES only; it carves out comments and failure
 * messages on the stated reasoning that "a human reads them beside the code
 * they annotate". objectui#8875 observes that the justification holds for a
 * SAME-FILE citation and does not hold for a CROSS-FILE one: the reader of
 * `packages/types/src/crud.ts` is not looking at
 * `packages/core/src/actions/ActionRunner.ts`, nothing puts the cited line in
 * front of them, and nothing tells them it moved.
 *
 * That card rules on nothing. It names three possible directions -- extend the
 * ESLint rule to comments and message strings, add a report-only census, or
 * rule the form out and repair on sight -- and says the choice "needs the
 * tree-wide population that has NOT been measured".
 *
 * THIS SCRIPT IS THAT MEASUREMENT AND NOTHING ELSE. It prints a number. It
 * repairs nothing, it is not wired into CI, and it takes no position on which
 * of the three directions the number favours. Deciding that is objectui#8875's
 * next step and is reserved to it.
 *
 * ## Why a `census:*` script and not a `check:*` gate
 *
 * The form follows this tree's own convention, and the convention is load
 * bearing rather than cosmetic. Two `census:*` scripts already exist
 * (`census:body-dialect`, `census:tsconfig-test-parity`); measured on this
 * tree, `census:body-dialect` appears in NO file under `.github/workflows/`
 * while the control `check:entry-guard` resolves to `lint.yml`. So `census:*`
 * is the spelling that already means "runnable, reported, not blocking", and
 * choosing it is how this change stays report-only WITHOUT a reader having to
 * take that on trust. A `check:*` name would invite the next sweep to wire it
 * into a workflow, which objectui#8875 explicitly reserved.
 *
 * It also keeps a second obligation out of the way: objectui#3653 pins
 * `content/docs/guide/ci-cd-pipeline.md`'s table BY COMMAND, so a CI step here
 * would owe a matching documentation row for a gate nobody has decided to have.
 *
 * ## What counts as a citation -- five syntaxes, and why each is here
 *
 * objectui#8875 measured four spellings in PR #8867's blast radius and named a
 * fifth that no basename-anchored probe can see. All five are read here,
 * because the card's own evidence is that a single-syntax probe under-reads
 * this class by construction -- the filing seat's first probe was `path:line`
 * only and missed a `#L` permalink among its own 73 hits.
 *
 *   1. `name.ext:NNN`      -- the dominant spelling. The name may carry
 *                            directories (`packages/core/src/x.ts:12`) or be a
 *                            bare basename (`ActionRunner.ts:112`).
 *   2. `name.ext#LNNN`     -- the GitHub permalink form, including inside a
 *                            full `https://github.com/...` URL, where suffix
 *                            resolution below strips the `blob/<ref>/` prefix.
 *   3. `line NNN of/in/at NAME` -- the address written before the name.
 *   4. `NAME line NNN`     -- the address written after the name.
 *   5. THE CONTINUATION ADDRESS -- a bare `:NNN` or `#LNNN` carrying NO
 *      filename, inheriting the file from whatever put one in scope nearby.
 *      `packages/types/src/crud.ts` writes
 *      `` `ActionRunner.ts:1788` and `:1794` ``; a `basename:[0-9]+` probe
 *      cannot match the second one. The card caught it only because a human
 *      read the site the probe did hit. It is the syntax most likely to be
 *      missed and the reason a count from a one-syntax probe is not a census.
 *
 *      ⚠️ SCOPE OPENS TWO WAYS, and until objectui#9026 only the first was
 *      read: a full `NAME:NNN`, and -- the one that was missing -- a bare
 *      FILENAME with no address of its own, as in "`` `…/ObjectKanban.tsx` ``
 *      reads `schema.groupBy` at" followed by `` `:601`, `:625`, `:640` ``.
 *      That second form is what `ObjectKanbanSchema.groupBy` used for six
 *      addresses that had ALL rotted, and this file scored the docblock zero.
 *      ⇒ It was not report-only about that class, it was SILENT on it, which
 *      is worse: a reader who knows the number is report-only still reads a
 *      clean sheet as nothing new to look at.
 *
 *      ⛔ WHAT THIS SYNTAX STILL DOES NOT COVER, stated so it cannot be cited
 *      as coverage it does not have. Scope reaches `CONT_WINDOW` lines below
 *      the last thing that named a file and stops at a blank line, so an
 *      address restated further down -- past a paragraph break, with no
 *      filename near it -- is NOT read. That is deliberate and measured: it is
 *      the guard that keeps a bare `:NNN` from being a colon and a number, and
 *      the docblock above is read five of six for exactly this reason. The
 *      sixth is pinned as blind by name in this file's test.
 *
 * The extension list (`SOURCE_EXT`) is what makes `NAME.ext:NNN` a SOURCE
 * ADDRESS rather than a coincidence, and it is copied in spirit from
 * `eslint-rules/no-line-address-in-test-name.js` so the two instruments agree
 * on what an address is: a version number (`1.2.3`) has no `:`, a clock time
 * (`12:30`) has no extension, and a host:port (`example.com:3000`) is excluded
 * because `com` is not in the list.
 *
 * ## What is carved out, and why the carve-outs are printed rather than hidden
 *
 * RELEASED CHANGELOG SECTIONS. `packages/plugin-form/CHANGELOG.md`'s hits sit
 * under the released heading `## 17.6.0`. A changelog entry is a DATED RECORD
 * OF WHAT WAS TRUE AT THAT RELEASE, regenerated from changesets -- re-addressing
 * it to today's tree would make it false AS HISTORY. So every line at or after
 * a `CHANGELOG.md`'s first released-version heading is excluded. Anything ABOVE
 * that heading is not yet a dated record and stays in the population.
 *
 * THIS SCRIPT AND ITS TEST. Both carry addresses as FIXTURE DATA -- including
 * the two controls below -- so counting them would be the instrument reading
 * itself.
 *
 * Both carve-outs are COUNTED AND PRINTED, never silently dropped. A carve-out
 * whose size is not reported is indistinguishable from a scanner that cannot
 * see the file at all, and this card's whole subject is a zero nobody audited.
 *
 * ⚠️ PENDING CHANGESETS ARE NOT CARVED OUT, and that is a judgement this census
 * declines to make FOR the reader rather than one it has taken. `.changeset/*.md`
 * is the largest single directory in the population. A pending changeset is the
 * SOURCE of a future dated changelog entry, so the released-changelog argument
 * arguably reaches it -- but it is not dated yet, it is still editable, and
 * objectui#8875 carved out released sections only. So the rows stay in, and the
 * `.changeset` line of the by-directory table is what lets anyone who disagrees
 * subtract them without re-running anything.
 *
 * SAME-FILE citations are excluded from the population, counted separately.
 * objectui#8047's carve-out reasoning -- "a human reads them beside the code
 * they annotate" -- is exactly what still holds there, and objectui#8875
 * questions only the cross-file case.
 *
 * ## TEST NAMES are out of scope, and the split is measured rather than assumed
 *
 * objectui#8047's rule owns citations that reach a test name and runs at
 * `error` in `eslint.config.js`, so that sub-population is kept at zero by lint
 * rather than by this script. This census does not re-implement the rule's AST
 * reading. Instead every hit is CLASSIFIED with a cheap line-anchored heuristic
 * (`in_test_name`) and the count is printed: if the ESLint rule is doing its
 * job that number is zero, and if it ever is not, the census says so instead of
 * quietly overlapping. Hits inside test FILES that are not test NAMES stay in
 * the population on purpose -- objectui#8875's own site list contains two
 * (`action-forward-parity.test.tsx:156`, `action-forward-precedence.test.tsx:139`).
 *
 * ## How a citation is judged FALSE -- and why "moved" is not the question
 *
 * objectui#8875's central reading is that 10 of the 14 references a PR's line
 * shifts moved were ALREADY FALSE before that branch existed. So movement is
 * necessary but not sufficient, and this census never asks whether a diff
 * shifted an address. It asks only what is AT THE CITED LINE TODAY.
 *
 * Four verdicts, in the order they are decided:
 *
 *   `out-of-range`    the cited line is past the end of the cited file.
 *                     Mechanically certain. FALSE.
 *   `non-substantive` the cited line is blank or carries nothing but
 *                     delimiters -- a docblock's closing star-slash, a bare
 *                     `});`, a `---` rule. A citation whose target
 *                     is a closing brace is rot; this is the shape the card's
 *                     own off-by-one control has. FALSE.
 *   `drifted`         the cited line carries none of the citation's own
 *                     content anchors, but at least one of them IS somewhere
 *                     else in the cited file. The census reports where. FALSE.
 *   `resolves`        at least one content anchor is on the cited line.
 *
 * plus three UNJUDGED outcomes that are reported separately and never folded
 * into the false count: `no-anchor` (the citing prose offered nothing to match
 * on), `anchor-absent` (the anchors appear nowhere in the cited file, so the
 * prose is probably not naming a symbol) and the two resolution failures
 * `no-such-file` / `ambiguous-basename`.
 *
 * The two resolution failures are findings in their own right and are the reason
 * they are named rather than merged. `no-such-file` is dominated by citations
 * into BUILD ARTIFACTS -- `packages/types/dist/overlay.d.ts:334`, `form.d.ts:1376`
 * -- which are untracked, regenerated, and cannot be checked by anything ever.
 * `ambiguous-basename` is a BARE BASENAME (`index.ts:255`, `ObjectView.tsx:37`)
 * that names several tracked files at once, so no instrument can decide which
 * one it meant. Neither is counted false, because neither has been shown wrong;
 * both are counted as citations no reader and no tool can resolve.
 *
 * CONTENT ANCHORS come only from places where this tree writes code rather than
 * English: backticked spans, quoted strings, and bare camelCase/PascalCase
 * identifiers, inside a +/-2 line window around the citation. Atoms belonging to
 * the cited path itself are dropped -- a file's own name appears on its own
 * lines, and matching that would score every citation `resolves`. There is no
 * English stopword list anywhere in here, deliberately: a stopword list is a
 * second thing to keep honest, and the three anchor sources are already
 * code-shaped by construction.
 *
 * ⚠️ The judged verdicts are a HEURISTIC over prose, and the direction of each
 * error is worth stating. A spuriously matched anchor scores `resolves` and
 * UNDER-reports; a citation to a whole block rather than a single line scores
 * `drifted` and OVER-reports. Both buckets are printed with their sites so a
 * reader can audit either direction, and the controls below are what keep the
 * instrument from collapsing into "flags everything" or "flags nothing".
 *
 * ## The two controls, both printed, both fatal
 *
 * objectui#8875's acceptance: a census that flags everything is as useless as
 * one that flags nothing, so the instrument has to be shown firing AND not
 * firing, on this tree, in its own output.
 *
 *   FIRING     `scripts/check-doc-component-types.mjs` cites the action
 *              vocabulary at `ActionRunner.ts:112`. Verified by content, not by
 *              number: line 112 is the closing delimiter of a docblock and
 *              `ActionDef` opens at 113. This citation MUST be reported false.
 *
 *   NON-FIRING `packages/types/src/crud.ts` cites `register('detail'` as
 *              resolving to `plugin-detail/src/index.tsx:387`. Verified by
 *              content: that line is the `ComponentRegistry.register('detail',`
 *              call. This citation MUST NOT be reported false.
 *
 * Either control failing exits non-zero, and so does an EMPTY POPULATION: a
 * census that reads nothing because it is blind is indistinguishable from a
 * clean tree, which is the failure this whole card is about. The controls are
 * addressed BY CONTENT (the citing file plus the cited symbol), never by their
 * own line numbers -- a control pinned by line address would be an instance of
 * the defect being measured.
