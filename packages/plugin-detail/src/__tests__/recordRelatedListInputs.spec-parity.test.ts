 * `record:related_list` — the published authoring surface stays in parity with
 * `@objectstack/spec` `RecordRelatedListProps` (objectui#3808).
 *
 * Third sibling of `recordHighlightsInputs.spec-parity.test.ts` (objectui#3407 /
 * PR #3795) and `recordDetailsInputs.spec-parity.test.ts` (objectui#3807), added
 * for the direction those two carry and the repo-wide gate had not: a top-level
 * key the SPEC declares must be discoverable from `inputs`.
 *
 * This block had the worst instance of it. `relationshipValueField` and `add`
 * were both spec keys the renderer had honoured all along —
 * `renderers/record-related-list.tsx:95` and `:186` — while `inputs` published
 * neither, and nothing anywhere reported the mismatch:
 * `gen-manifest.ts` left them out of `sdui.manifest.json` and
 * `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts`, `sdui-parser/src/validate.ts:74` returned
 * `unknown-prop` for an author who wrote one, and the renderer went on honouring
 * it. `add` in particular is the ONLY way to build a junction-assignment list,
 * so the single published route to that feature was an undiscoverable key.
 *
 * WHY A DESCRIPTION IS WORTH A TEST, and why `add`'s is checked member by
 * member: `ComponentInput` is flat by design, so an `object` input can document
 * its member shape nowhere but its own prose. The assertions below derive the
 * member list from the spec at runtime, so a spec change fails here rather than
 * leaving the description quietly incomplete — the failure mode objectui#3807
 * was filed for.
