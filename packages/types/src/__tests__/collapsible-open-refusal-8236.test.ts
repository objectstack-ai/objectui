/**
 * `open` is RETIRED on the `collapsible` node, on both faces (objectui#8236,
 * ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove; maintainer ruling 2026-09-17 「9593 A,其他同意」,
 * step 2 of two). `defaultOpen` is the surviving spelling for the INITIAL
 * state — and it is deliberately NOT offered as an equivalent, because it is
 * not one: `defaultOpen` seeds the state and hands control back to the user,
 * while `open` claimed to hold it.
 *
 * ## Why a REFUSAL and not a bare deletion
 *
 * `BaseSchemaCore` ends `.passthrough()` and the TS `BaseSchema` closes with an
 * index signature, so a dropped MEMBER key is KEPT, not refused. Deleting the
 * two declarations would have left the silent accept exactly as it was and
 * thrown the diagnostic away with it. `retirementTombstone()` keeps the key
 * DECLARED and unwritable, which is what makes the refusal loud — and it keeps
 * the mirror's key set equal to the declaration's, so the pair does not drift in
 * `zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The refusal is NOT what stops the takeover
 *
 * This card's whole shape turns on that. An authored `open` was LIVE: it rode
 * `SchemaRenderer`'s non-metadata spread into the collapsible renderer's
 * trailing `{...props}` and made the Radix primitive controlled, freezing the
 * trigger. objectui#9585 measured the render path NOT GATED — no `safeParse`
 * runs there — so retiring the declaration ALONE would have deleted the
 * author's only warning while the takeover kept running. The renderer-side
 * named exclusion is step 1 and landed FIRST, in the same change; the DOM
 * reading that settles it lives where a DOM exists
 * (`packages/components/src/__tests__/collapsible-open-intercept-8236.test.tsx`),
 * which also re-measures the NOT-GATED half on this very node.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Deliberately NOT a sweep
 *
 * `dialog` / `sheet` / `popover` declare `open` too, and there it is a REAL live
 * prop their primitives consume. The ruling bars a sibling sweep, and the last
 * describe block below is that scope kept as a live assertion rather than as
 * prose.
