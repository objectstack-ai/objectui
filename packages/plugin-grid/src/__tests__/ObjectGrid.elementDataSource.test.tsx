 *
 * `object-grid` consumes `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` (objectstack#6953).
 *
 * The spec declares this binding on EVERY page component, and objectstack#5576
 * wired it to `list-view` only. On `object-grid` nothing mapped
 * `dataSource.object` onto the `objectName` this block requires, so a page that
 * declared the binding the spec documents — and no separate `objectName` —
 * rendered an EMPTY grid: `getDataConfig` returned `null`, the fetch effect
 * never ran, and no error was reported anywhere. "Spec-valid metadata renders
 * nothing" is the objectstack#4413 shape.
 *
 * `object-grid` is the one block the binding maps onto without a gap — it reads
 * every key the binding carries — so both directions are asserted end to end
 * here: what reaches `dataSource.find`, and that a grid with no binding is
 * untouched.
 *
 * ## GROWN into this block's member pin (objectui#8071 slice 14)
 *
 * The four cases above cover `object`, `view` and `filter`. What they could not
 * state is the PRECEDENCE the remaining members are read through, which is the
 * half an author collides with: the binding carries five members
 * (`{ object, view, filter, sort, limit }`), a named `view` supplies a baseline
 * for four of them, and the block's own flat keys are a third source. Three
 * sources, one value, and the winner is different depending on which two are
 * present — none of it visible in the `type: 'object'` the registry publishes
 * or in the `binding: 'object'` marker beside it.
 *
 * The rule the second describe block pins, in one sentence: **a `dataSource.*`
 * member beats the block's own key, and the block's own key beats the view the
 * binding named.** Each row below is therefore a PAIR — the same member, once
 * written on the binding and once supplied by the view — because either half
 * alone is consistent with a renderer that simply takes the last writer.
