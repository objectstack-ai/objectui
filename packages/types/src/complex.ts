/**
 * Kanban card — the shape the registered `'kanban'` renderer reads.
 *
 * ## Why this dialect lives here (objectui#7664, maintainer ruling (a), 2026-09-05)
 *
 * `@object-ui/types` used to declare a DIFFERENT board under the same
 * `'kanban'` key — the `DeclarativeKanban*` trio (`columns` with `color`,
 * `draggable`, cards with `labels` / `assignees` / `priority`), which was the
 * `'kanban'` arm of `ComplexSchema` → `AnyComponentSchema` → `safeValidateSchema`
 * — while the renderer registered for that key (`ObjectKanbanRenderer` in
 * `@object-ui/plugin-kanban`) consumed the plugin's own `KanbanSchema`. A board
 * could pass `objectui validate` and render EMPTY, because the validator and the
 * renderer honoured two unrelated faces (objectui#6086 measured the consequence).
 *
 * The ruling: for an authored `type: 'kanban'` document the PLUGIN dialect is
 * authoritative, so this package declares exactly that dialect and
 * `@object-ui/plugin-kanban` imports it back rather than declaring its own
 * (`packages/plugin-kanban/src/types.ts` re-exports these names — one
 * declaration, one authority, the dependency direction unchanged: `types`
 * declares, the plugin conforms). The declarative trio and its three Zod
 * mirrors are retired in the same change (ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove): its only
 * retained value was the validator arm, and that arm now validates this shape.
 * objectui#6172's "keep both faces" half is what this reverses; the ruling says
 * so explicitly.
 *
 * Every member below was carried from the plugin's declaration verbatim. The
 * runtime-computed members (`cardSubtitle`, `cardFieldCells`, `coverImage`,
 * a badge's `colorStyle`) are what `ObjectKanban` writes onto the cards it
 * hands the board and what `KanbanImpl` / `KanbanEnhanced` read back; the Zod
 * mirror (`zod/complex.zod.ts`) passes those through the way it passes
 * `TableColumn.headerIcon` through (objectui#6424).
 *
 * `React.CSSProperties` / `React.ReactNode` resolve through the ambient
 * namespace, the way `data-display.ts` already spells `headerIcon` and
 * `rowStyle` — this package still declares no React dependency.

/**
 * ⛔ `KanbanSchema` — the `'kanban'` arm — is RETIRED (objectui#8802,
 * maintainer ruling 2026-09-09: 「从我们的业务需求角度，我应该只需要
 * `object-kanban`」, recorded verbatim and not translated).
 *
 * ## What this dissolves
 *
 * The bare `kanban` node type key published TWO faces with OPPOSITE verdicts on
 * the same document: `@object-ui/plugin-kanban`'s registry `inputs` declared
 * `titleField` while this arm refused it by name after batch #70
 * (objectui#7742). With the key retired there is no arm left to disagree with,
 * so objectui#8802's four options are moot rather than chosen between.
 *
 * ## Where the vocabulary went
 *
 * ⛔ Nowhere, and that is the point: `object-kanban` has ALWAYS had its own
 * declared face, {@link ObjectKanbanSchema} (`./objectql.ts`), and an
 * `object-kanban` document has always been judged by it alone. Retiring this
 * arm therefore changes the verdict on `type: 'kanban'` documents only. The
 * keys this arm alone declared — `columns`, `cardTitle`, `swimlaneField`,
 * `grouping`, `conditionalFormatting`, `navigation` — were never part of the
 * `object-kanban` face and are not being removed from it.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why the Zod mirror is a NAMED REFUSAL and not a deletion
 *
 * {@link BaseSchema} closes with `[key: string]: any` and its Zod twin ends
 * `.passthrough()`. A dropped MEMBER key is therefore KEPT, not refused — the
 * failure objectui#7664's own first cut shipped at `onCardClick`. A dropped
 * TYPE LITERAL behaves differently on a DISCRIMINATED union (`AnyComponentSchema`
 * selects one arm from the authored literal), so removal alone would already
 * refuse — but only with the union's generic `Invalid input`, naming no remedy.
 * ⇒ `zod/complex.zod.ts` keeps an arm for the literal and refuses it BY NAME
 * through `retiredNodeType()`, pointing the author at `object-kanban`.
 *
 * The TypeScript half of the refusal is this deletion: with no `kanban` arm in
 * {@link ComplexSchema} and no `'kanban'` entry in `SchemaRegistry`, `tsc`
 * refuses the literal at the authoring site.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The layer that did NOT move
 *
 * `kanban` also names a STORED `NamedListView.type` (`./objectql.ts`) — the
 * value `CreateViewDialog` writes and every tenant's database holds. It is
 * UNTOUCHED. `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView` maps a stored `kanban` view onto the
 * node type `object-kanban` already, as it does for all twelve stored view
 * types, so every board any user ever created through the console already
 * renders through the surviving spelling and this retirement moves zero stored
 * documents.
 *
 * {@link KanbanCard}, {@link KanbanColumn}, {@link CardTemplate} and
 * {@link ColumnWidthConfig} are NOT retired — the renderer, the `CardTemplates`
 * component and the `useColumnWidths` hook still consume them.
 *
 * Pinned in `./__tests__/bare-kanban-node-key-retired-8802.test.ts`.

/**
 * Chatbot component — the authoring face of the

 *
 * ## Six ADR-0049 retirement tombstones (objectui#7703)
 *
 * `loading`, `showAvatars`, `userAvatar`, `assistantAvatar`, `markdown` and
 * `height` are `?: never` below, each paired with a `retirementTombstone()`
 * arm on the Zod twin (`zod/complex.zod.ts`). They were declared here,
 * mirrored there, and read by NO registration — a published type teaching six
 * knobs that did nothing.
 *
 * The instrument, re-measured on this branch's base rather than inherited
 * from the card: one `schema.KEY` count per `ComponentRegistry.register(...)`
 * body of `renderer.tsx`, the file split at the three register calls
 * (`chatbot` / `chatbot-enhanced` / `chatbot-floating`). All six read
 * 0 / 0 / 0. Lit controls on the same instrument in the same pass —
 * `placeholder` 1 / 1 / 1, `messages` 1 / 1 / 1, `userAvatarUrl` 1 / 1 / 1,
 * `maxHeight` 1 / 1 / 0, `floatingConfig` 0 / 0 / 1, `processVisibility`
 * 0 / 1 / 0 — so the zeros are readings, not a blind grep.
 *
 * The named-read census is now the WHOLE channel. It was not always: the
 * `chatbot-floating` registration used to end its `<FloatingChatbot>` element
 * with a raw `{...props}` spread, which handed the panel's `<ChatbotEnhanced>`
 * every authored key unfiltered — and that component HAS a `showAvatars` prop,
 * so the key was live there by accident. objectui#7708 ruled FENCE: the spread
 * is filtered through `toDomProps` and moved to the head of the element, the
 * shape the two sibling registrations already used. ⇒ `showAvatars` is a key
 * the FENCE turned dark, not a key nothing ever read; the other five were live
 * on no channel at any time (`loading`, `userAvatar`, `assistantAvatar`,
 * `markdown` and `height` are not `ChatbotEnhancedProps` members either —
 * markdown exists there only as `enableMarkdown` — so the spread had nothing
 * to land them on).
 *
 * ⚠️ `processVisibility` is deliberately NOT part of this retirement:
 * `chatbot-enhanced` reads it (0 / 1 / 0), and objectui#7655 left the member
 * here exactly as it was.
 *
 * ## Why tombstones and not deletions — the mirror decides it here
 *
 * All six HAVE a Zod arm, so deleting the declaration would trade one silent
 * no-op for another: `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()` on the Zod side and
 * carries a `[key: string]: any` index signature on the TS side, so an
 * UNDECLARED key is not refused, it is KEPT. That is the hazard the two-prong
 * discriminator leaves to the carrier — where there is no mirror there is "no
 * silent-strip hazard for prong 2 to guard" (`mobile.ts`, objectui#5941 /
 * #7526 / #7678: a tombstone exists to steer authors to a named live
 * replacement KEY, or to keep loud a key the docs taught as working). Here
 * there IS a mirror to host the refusal, and prong 1 holds by the letter for
 * four of the six — `userAvatar` → `userAvatarUrl`, `assistantAvatar` →
 * `assistantAvatarUrl`, `height` → `maxHeight`, `markdown` →
 * `enableMarkdown` on a `chatbot-enhanced` node. Each member's own comment
 * names its replacement, or says there is none.
 *
 * ## Why not ENFORCE, decided per key
 *
 * The other arm of enforce-or-remove was taken key by key and refused each
 * time. `<Chatbot>` — the component THIS registration renders
 * (`plugin-chatbot/src/index.tsx`) — declares `messages`, `placeholder`,
 * `onSendMessage`, `disabled`, `showTimestamp`, `userAvatarUrl`,
 * `userAvatarFallback`, `assistantAvatarUrl`, `assistantAvatarFallback` and
 * `maxHeight`, and not one of the six. Enforcing any of them would mean
 * growing a component prop (a feature, not a retirement) or wiring a SECOND
 * spelling of a key that already works — the N dialects AGENTS.md #0.1
 * forbids. Per-key argument in each member's comment.

   * registration forwards it by name, and this one renders `<Chatbot>`, which
   * has no such prop — the card's own counter-example, re-confirmed here.
   *
   * ENFORCE was refused: on a `chatbot` node it has no target to forward to,
   * and re-declaring it on the two faces that CAN reach `<ChatbotEnhanced>`
   * would re-open by declaration exactly the channel objectui#7708 closed by
   * fence, one card earlier. `@default true` was published prose only — the
   * plain `<Chatbot>` renders an avatar beside every message unconditionally,

   * control in the `chatbot-floating` registration's `inputs`, and seeded as
   * `'floating'` by that registration's `defaultProps` — and read by nothing.
   * `chatbot-floating` renders `<FloatingChatbot>` unconditionally and
   * `chatbot` never looked at the key, so `'floating'` on a `chatbot` node
   * produced no trigger and `'inline'` on a `chatbot-floating` node changed
   * nothing. A whole-repo `git grep` census over tracked files, build output
   * excluded, returned those sites, the doc comments and ledger entries beside
   * them, one historical CHANGELOG line and two unrelated `displayMode` props
   * (`GridField`, `MasterDetailForm`); the same pass over `floatingConfig`, a
   * key that IS read, returned 79 lines, so the instrument was not blind. The
   * control and the seed are removed in the same change; the restatement of
   * that control is this tombstone plus the release note (objectui#7070: a
   * control is restated, never deleted into a vacuum).
   *
   * ## Why a tombstone — discriminator prong 2 — and why it is loud-vs-silent here
   *
   * A `?: never` tombstone is available only on a surviving carrier
   * (`ChatbotSchema` survives) and is used when either prong of this package's
   * discriminator holds: it steers authors to a named live replacement KEY,
   * or it keeps loud a key the docs taught as working. Prong 2 holds: the key
   * was advertised in the 3.3.0 release record (`CHANGELOG.md:578`, "Extended
   * `ChatbotSchema` with `displayMode` (`'inline' | 'floating'`) …") and its
   * published comment told authors it selected the presentation. Prong 1 is
   * not met by the letter — the replacement is the discriminant `type`, not a
   * new key — which is why the guidance above names `type`.
   *
   * On a carrier extending {@link BaseSchema} — every component schema in this
   * package — deleting an optional member is SILENT in every value shape,
   * because the `[key: string]: any` index signature defeats both
   * excess-property checking and the weak-type check. Measured on THIS member
   * with `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`, a no-index-signature control carrier
   * (`FloatingChatbotConfig`) lit in the same run (TS2353 on a fresh undeclared
   * key, TS2559 on a lone-key widened value):
   *
   *   | route      | fresh `'floating'` | fresh `'bogus'` | widened `'floating'` |
   *   |------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
   *   | declared   | clean              | TS2322          | clean                |
   *   | DELETED    | clean              | clean           | clean                |
   *   | TOMBSTONED | TS2322             | TS2322          | TS2322               |
   *
   * Deleted, the member reads as `any` through the index signature and even a
   * wrong-typed value goes quiet. Tombstoned, PRESENCE with any value is a
   * compile error — a channel deletion cannot produce on this carrier at all:
   * on a `BaseSchema` carrier the two routes are loud-vs-silent, not
   * louder-vs-quieter. Pinned, the deleted row included as a live control, in
   * `__tests__/chatbot-display-mode-retired.test.ts`.
   *
   * ## Runtime: unchanged, deliberately — zero validation before and after
   *
   * There is NO `retirementTombstone()` half. `displayMode` has never had a
   * Zod arm: it sits in the `UnmirroredDeclared` ledger for both
   * `complex.zod.ts#ChatbotSchema` and `#ChatbotFloatingSchema`
   * (`__tests__/zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`), and `BaseSchema` is
   * `.passthrough()`, so a stored document carrying `displayMode: 'floating'`
   * — every node the designer ever created — parsed green before this change
   * and parses green after it, and the value is dropped at render time as it
   * always was. Minting an arm to refuse it would be the declared-but-
   * unmirrored axis (objectui#6152); the retirement test pins both twins'

   * It is also absent from the `chatbot-floating` registration's `inputs` AND
   * its `defaultProps` (`plugin-chatbot/src/renderer.tsx`), so no designer
   * control ever offered it and no designer-created node carries it. The key
   * was reachable from TypeScript alone — which is exactly the surface this
   * tombstone closes.
   *
   * ## Why there is NO `retirementTombstone()` half, and why that is not an omission
   *
   * The other tombstones in this package pair `?: never` with a
   * `retirementTombstone()` refusal on the Zod twin. There is no twin to carry
   * one here: `FloatingChatbotConfig` has NO Zod mirror at all, and
   * `floatingConfig` sits in the `UnmirroredDeclared` ledger
   * (`__tests__/zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`, `complex.zod.ts#ChatbotSchema`).
   * `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`, so the whole `floatingConfig` object
   * rides through unvalidated — before this change and after it, byte for
   * byte. Minting a mirror to host a refusal would be the declared-but-
   * UNMIRRORED axis (objectui#6152), a different defect from this one: a key
   * can be mirrored and inert, or unmirrored and live, and fixing one says
   * nothing about the other. This retirement deliberately does not widen into
   * it, so `triggerIcon`'s refusal is TYPE-LEVEL ONLY. Runtime parse behaviour
   * is unchanged.
   *
   * ## Why a tombstone and not a deletion, with only the `tsc` channel available
   *
   * The usual argument for `?: never` over deletion is about the mirror (an
   * undeclared key is silently STRIPPED by a non-strict `z.object`), and with
   * no mirror here that argument does not apply. The tombstone earns its place
   * on the TypeScript channel alone instead, measured both ways:
   *
   *   - DELETED, a fresh object literal is refused — `TS2353: Object literal
   *     may only specify known properties` — but a WIDENED value is not.
   *     `const raw = { triggerIcon: 'Sparkles' }; const c: FloatingChatbotConfig
   *     = raw;` compiled CLEAN, because excess-property checking does not reach
   *     a non-fresh type. That is the silent no-op traded for another one.
   *   - TOMBSTONED, both paths are refused: the declared `never` makes the
   *     assignment itself ill-typed, so freshness stops mattering.
   *
   * Pinned in `__tests__/floating-chatbot-trigger-icon-retired.test.ts`,
   * including the deletion contrast, so nobody can "simplify" this back into a
   * deletion without that file going red.
   *
   * RETIRED (objectui#7654, ADR-0049) — never read: the FAB trigger renders a
   * fixed icon and takes no icon prop. There is no authored spelling that
   * changes it; the trigger's markup is the only place to change it.
   * @deprecated Not part of `FloatingChatbotConfig`'s contract — the value was inert.

/**
 * objectui COMPONENT types admitted into a dashboard **widget slot** — the

 * `metric-card` into, verbatim: *an SDUI dashboard COMPONENT node validates
 * against objectui's own component schema; the spec's `DashboardSchema` governs
 * stored dashboard metadata documents only and grows no component projection;
 * `metric-card` joins objectui's own CLOSED component enum as an explicitly
 * allowed objectui extension, NOT the spec widget enum.*
 *
 * A member here is not a visualization family at all. `classifyWidgetType`
 * (`@object-ui/plugin-dashboard`'s `widgetDispatch.ts`) returns `passthrough`
 * for it, and `DashboardRenderer` then hands `{ ...widget }` straight to
 * `SchemaRenderer`, which resolves it through `ComponentRegistry` — so the
 * widget slot is holding an ordinary objectui SDUI **component node** whose
 * other keys are that component's own props (`value` / `icon` / `trend` /
 * `trendValue` for `metric-card`, declared as registry `inputs` at
 * `plugin-dashboard/src/index.tsx`). Those props are NOT widget keys and must
 * not be added to {@link DashboardWidgetSchema}; a member of this list is
 * validated as a component node against objectui's own passthrough
 * `BaseSchema`, which is what keeps them. On the TypeScript face that node is
 * {@link DashboardWidgetSlotComponentSchema}, the component arm — first, as
 * in the Zod twin — of `DashboardComponentSchema.widgets` (objectui#7952).

 * "extension allowed" hatch as the thing to avoid: an open hatch re-creates
 * exactly the hole the catalog gate exists to close, because a typo'd or
 * retired `type` would keep validating. Adding a member is a deliberate act
 * with a registration behind it — `examples/schema-catalog/test/
 * plugin-dashboard-component-schema.test.ts` is the standing gate, and
 * `__tests__/report-chart-query-spec-parity.test.ts` pins the closure.
