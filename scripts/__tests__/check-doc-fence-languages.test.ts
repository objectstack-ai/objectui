/**

 * fences only — one spelling of an unhighlighted fence out of several. A

 *
 * `check-doc-fence-languages.mjs` closes that by reading BODIES rather than
 * pinning a list of languages. This file pins the two things its correctness
 * rests on and cannot check about itself:
 *
 *   1. **The scan surface really is the gate's.** The guard re-implements
 *      `listDocuments` so it needs no `pnpm install` — the gate imports
 *      `typescript`, and an install-gated docs check is one a docs-only pull
 *      request skips, which is the hole `doc-component-types.yml`'s header
 *      records. A copy that is never compared is a copy free to drift, and the
 *      drift direction is silent: a document the guard stops walking is a
 *      document nothing reports on. So both walks are imported and compared.
 *   2. **The wiring.** A gate nobody runs is indistinguishable from a gate that
 *      passes (`entry-guard-wiring.test.ts` records that lesson for its own
 *      subject). The alias, the workflow, the self-test leg and the
 *      unfiltered triggers are asserted here.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted: the size of the baseline or the number of blocks it
 * carries. Those move with every objectui#5867 batch, and a hand-copied
 * enumeration in a test drifts by construction — the lesson `lint-workflow.test.ts`
 * records for this repository at length. The guard's own output is the honest
 * place for those numbers.

   * DIRECTLY is gone from the sentence above because keeping it would only have
   * inverted the same gap between what this pin claims and what it does.
   *
   * Both twin headers were clean under BOTH patterns when this was carried
   * across, so this closes a proven hole rather than a live violation.
   *

   * the verdict line") would pin a wording, and pinned wording is the thing this

   * The positive control for the pin above — objectui#7914.
   *
   * A pin that cannot fail is not a pin, and this repository has shipped one
   * with zero demonstrated power before (objectui#7466: 0/32 on the broken tree
   * AND 0/32 on the fixed one). This header carries no count today, so the pin
   * above asserts `[] toEqual []` — and would assert exactly that if the pattern
   * were deleted, reversed, or narrowed back to adjacency. Nothing in this file
   * exercised the claim, which is why objectui#7888 had to demonstrate its own
   * widening out of band, in a pull request description this repository does not
   * hold. The shapes that actually rotted are fixtured here as POSITIVES rather
   * than trusted to a reading of the regex. The block is carried from the third
   * copy's control in `check-links-workflow.test.ts`, which has held this shape
   * since objectui#7825 — one shape, three homes, so none of them may drift.
   *
   * The first entry is this header's own pre-fix sentence, verbatim; two more
   * are what its twin and the third copy said. `15 INTERNAL documents` is the
   * direction objectui#7888 turned on, and it is measured, not assumed: run over
   * that line, the adjacency-only pattern this pin used to carry returns `[]`,
   * because one adjective sat between the numeral and the noun.
   *
   * ⭐ Two entries state a number that is CORRECT TODAY — this gate's own verdict
   * line reported `227 document(s)` on the day this control was written. They are
   * rejected anyway, and that is the entire point: the rule governs the WRITING,
   * not one wrong figure. A control that only rejected stale numbers would wave
   * the same trap through on the day the number happens to be right, which is
   * precisely the day it starts rotting again.
   *
   * The negatives are numbers this header legitimately carries. The first is a
   * MEASURED false positive of the pre-objectui#7888 pattern: run over
   * `#7448 documents the rule`, it returned `["7448 documents"]` — an issue
   * reference read as a document count. The negative lookbehind rules that out at
   * the pattern level now, and this fixture is what keeps it ruled out.
