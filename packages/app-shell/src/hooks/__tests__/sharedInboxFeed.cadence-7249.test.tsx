 *
 * objectui#7249 — ONE cadence, owned by the shared feed, however many consumers
 * mount.
 *
 * ## What the card reported, and what was actually measured
 *
 * The card reported the console HOME issuing the inbox pair
 * (`sys_inbox_message?top=20` + `sys_notification_receipt?top=200`) every
 * **2000 ms** — five times `INBOX_POLL_MS` — against ~10 s on an app page, and
 * read that asymmetry as a second scheduler on Home racing the shared feed.
 *
 * Re-measured against the same backend (showcase, objectstack `main`), signed in
 * as the same seeded admin, in a controlled Playwright context — 60 s idle,
 * every request to the two reads recorded:
 *
 *   | surface                                   | inbox pairs / 60 s | gaps (ms)     |
 *   | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
 *   | `/_console/home` (the card's own URL)     | 6                  | 10054-10077   |
 *   | `/home` on this package's dev build       | 6                  | 10042-10089   |
 *   | `/home`, after 4x home<->app route churn  | 6                  | 10074-10091   |
 *   | `/home`, tab hidden                       | 1                  | (60 s)        |
 *
 * The 2 s cadence did not reproduce on any of them, and `approvals/requests`
 * held its own 30 s. There is no second scheduler: `useHomeInbox` and
 * `useInboxBell` both fetch nothing, and `useClientNotifications` — the other
 * candidate — has no call sites in this repo at all.
 *
 * ## Why a pin, then, if nothing is broken
 *
 * Because "one cadence, owned by the shared feed" was true only by measurement,
 * and nothing in the suite said so. The neighbouring pins
 * (`sharedInboxFeed.twoSurfaces`) assert the MOUNT-time dedupe — one read for
 * the bell and Home together, a late consumer served without re-reading — which
 * is a different claim: it is satisfied by any number of schedulers that happen
 * to agree on the first tick. Nothing advanced a clock and counted, so a
 * consumer that grew its own `setInterval` would have kept every existing pin
 * green and cost a browser dogfood to find. It cost one here.
 *
 * That is the whole content of this file: the cadence is a property of the FEED,
 * not of how many consumers mount or which page they mount on, and it is now
 * enforced rather than measured. #4197 / #4225 / #4316 each fought for one read
 * feeding both surfaces; this is the clock-domain half of that invariant.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (prediction first, measured in this PR)
 *
 *   - set `INBOX_POLL_MS` to 2_000 — the cadence the card reported — and the
 *     three counting cases go RED (`expected 31 to be 7`, and `expected 32 to
 *     be 8` for the return-to-tab window) while every other inbox pin,
 *     `twoSurfaces` included, stays GREEN: 1 file failed, 1 passed, 3 tests
 *     failed of 18. That asymmetry is the point — it is the exact defect the
 *     card described, and the existing suite cannot see it. Predicted two red
 *     cases and measured three: the return-to-tab case counts a window too, so
 *     it fails on the same arithmetic.
 *   - the hidden-tab case stays GREEN under that same mutation, correctly: the
 *     backgrounded delay is `max(HIDDEN_POLL_MS, backoff)`, which a faster
 *     FOREGROUND constant cannot move. It pins a different clock, which is why
 *     it is a separate case.
 *   - give `useHomeInbox` a second scheduler of its own and
 *     "one feed's cadence, not one per consumer" goes RED while the single-
 *     consumer case stays green — a second scheduler is not a faster one.
 *
 * ## Later — objectui#7392 narrowed that receipt read's PAYLOAD
 *
 * The `top=200` receipt read named above is the shape #7249 measured, and is
 * left standing as the record of that measurement. objectui#7392 replaced it
 * with a read scoped to the notification ids the message read just listed, and
 * with that made it CONDITIONAL: a window listing nothing joinable issues no
 * receipt read at all.
 *
 * The subject of this file is the CADENCE, which that change does not touch —
 * but its fixture now lists rows, because "the receipt read is exactly as
 * frequent as the message read" is not assertable on a window where no receipt
 * read is due. The equality is unchanged; what changed is that it is now
 * exercised on a window that has something to join, with the empty window
 * pinned separately below.
