 * markdown-test-inputs -- which markdown documents are a TEST'S INPUT, and

 *   node scripts/markdown-test-inputs.mjs --list            the adjudicated class
 *   node scripts/markdown-test-inputs.mjs --audit           re-derive and compare

 *   node scripts/markdown-test-inputs.mjs --changed a.md b.md
 *
 * `--changed` prints the subset of the paths handed to it that this repository
 * has recorded as a test's input, one per line, and exits 0 whether or not the
 * subset is empty -- an EMPTY LIST IS AN ANSWER, and a non-zero exit means the
 * question could not be answered at all. That distinction is the whole contract
 * with the caller in `ci.yml`, which treats "could not answer" as RUN.
 *
 * ## The blind spot this exists to close (objectui#8861)
 *
 * The `Decide whether this change needs a full run` step in `ci.yml` diffs a
 * pull request against its merge base with every markdown path excluded, and
 * skips the expensive jobs when nothing is left. That fast path is deliberate
 * and that workflow says so in its own comment. It is sound wherever a markdown
 * change is INERT.
 *
 * It is not inert when a test READS the markdown file as data. Then a
 * markdown-only pull request mutates a test's input while skipping the test that
 * consumes it, and the pull request page goes green on a question nobody asked.
 *
 * Measured, not hypothetical: objectui#8857 changed exactly one file,
 * `packages/plugin-dashboard/README.md`. Every check on the pull request was
 * green -- `Test (shard 1/4)` reported success after ten seconds, having run
 * nothing. The merge queue, whose build short-circuits this step to "run
 * everything", then took 907 seconds on the same shard and FAILED it
 * (`SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'`, out of the test that reads that
 * README), and the pull request was dequeued. The queue did its job; the cost is
 * that the signal arrived after review had concluded on a green page.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Why this ships a LEDGER rather than a number
 *
 * Two probes have been run at this class and returned two different numbers --
 * 21 and 27 -- and NEITHER of them is the class. Both counted co-occurrence
 * (a test file that calls `readFileSync(` and also mentions `README.md`), and a
 * co-occurrence count is not a class predicate: a test may read something else
 * entirely and merely mention a README in its prose, several read
 * `content/docs/**` rather than a package README, and at least three read a
 * whole DIRECTORY TREE of markdown without naming a single document. Each
 * candidate has to be asked WHAT IT IS before it counts. This repository has
 * written that lesson down before (objectui#8468: one grep matched three
 * different constructs, two of them correct code).
 *
 * So the thing that ships is the derivation, in two halves that check each
 * other:
 *
 *   `ADJUDICATED`   the answer a human gave for every candidate -- what the test
 *                   reads (`reads`), and which of the scanner's guesses it does
 *                   NOT read (`notRead`), so a rejected candidate is recorded as
 *                   rejected instead of vanishing.
 *   `deriveCandidates()`  the scanner that produces the candidates from the tree
 *                   again on every run. `auditTree()` compares the two, and a
 *                   candidate nobody has adjudicated is a FINDING.
 *
 * That is what keeps the class true as documents are added: a new test that
 * reads a markdown document appears as an unadjudicated candidate and reds the
 * audit, and a new document dropped into a tree that is already declared
 * (`content/docs/**`) is covered the moment it lands.
 *
 * ## objectui#9096 -- `scripts` joins the scan, and what that ruling costs
 *
 * objectui#8861 left `scripts/__tests__/**` out and gave this reason:
 *
 *   ⛔ "`scripts/__tests__/**` is deliberately OUT of the hazard class:
 *      `scripts/**` is not on the exclusion list, so a PR touching it already
 *      gets a full run."
 *
 * ⛔ That sentence is true about a pull request that touches THE TEST. The
 * hazard is a pull request that touches THE MARKDOWN THE TEST READS. Those are
 * different pull requests, and only the second one is invisible.
 *
 * ### The measurement, and why the population count is the wrong unit
 *
 * Every one of the 46 candidate files under `scripts/__tests__` was run under
 * an `fs` trace and the markdown it opened was recorded. The union is not
 * "nearly every markdown document in the tree" -- it is EVERY one of them:
 * 1805 of 1805 tracked `.md` / `.mdx` files are opened by at least one of these
 * tests. One file does it alone: `dollar-dialect-alias-census.test.ts` scans
 * every tracked path through a helper module, which is limit 2 below in its
 * purest form -- the scanner cannot see that read at all, and it is the read
 * that makes the class total.
 *
 * ⇒ so the honest statement of this ruling is: on the `test` job, the decision
 * step's markdown exclusions are now INERT. Any markdown-only pull request runs
 * the shards.
 *
 * The reason that is nonetheless the right ruling is that documents are the
 * wrong unit to price it in. Runs are. Measured over the 513 first-parent
 * commits on `main` available at the time of writing:
 *
 *   36  reached the second stage at all (everything they changed was excluded)
 *   21  of those already run, on the class objectui#8861 declared
 *   15  still skipped -- the blind spot this card is about
 *   14  of those 15 fire once `scripts` is a scan root
 *    1  of those 15 still skips, and SHOULD: `8011852dc` changed only
 *       `apps/site/**` and carried no markdown at all
 *
 * ⇒ the price of making the class total is 14 extra full runs per 513 merges
 * (2.7pp), because 93% of merges change something outside the exclusions and
 * already run. The exclusion list itself does NOT go inert: non-markdown paths
 * under `content/**`, `docs/**` and `apps/site/**` still skip, and that last
 * commit is the live control for it.
 *
 * ### ⚠️ What a reviewer should weigh against it
 *
 * triage on objectui#9096 wrote "⛔ Do not widen the `Test (shard N/4)` trigger
 * to 'every markdown file' ... a resolved input list, ⛔ not a glob". The
 * MECHANISM that fence prescribes is intact -- the workflow still consults a
 * derived, adjudicated, self-auditing list and never a glob. Its EFFECT is not:
 * the list's answer is now `true` for every markdown path. That tension is real
 * and is left visible on purpose rather than argued away. The two numbers a
 * reviewer needs to reverse this are above: 1805 of 1805 documents, 14 of 513
 * merges.
 *
 * ### Where the trees come from
 *
 * A `…/**` entry below means "this test walks this tree". Where a test read
 * most of a tree, the tree is declared rather than its files, which is the same
 * over-produce-rather-than-miss direction the scanner takes: the cost of a
 * declared document nothing reads is one extra run, and the cost of a missed
 * one is the defect this file exists to close.
 *
 * ### The repository root is a tree too -- `./*` (objectui#9142)
 *
 * The entries above buy their whole value from INHERITANCE: a page added under
 * `content/docs/` is on the trigger the moment it lands, because the tree was
 * declared rather than its members. The repository root had no tree spelling,
 * so its documents were declared one by one -- and a root document nobody had
 * declared yet was not on the trigger at all. Adding `SECURITY.md` skipped
 * `Test (shard N/4)`, and `check-doc-links.test.ts`, whose stated job is to
 * fail on a root document with no `SCAN_ROOTS` row, was the test that did not
 * run. `./*` is the root's tree spelling: depth 1, markdown only. See
 * `matchesEntry()` for why depth 1 and not `**`.
 *
 * ## ⛔ What this does NOT answer -- read this before citing it as coverage
 *
 *   1. **Test surfaces outside `SCAN_ROOTS`.** ⭐ RULED, objectui#9096 -- this
 *      limit is closed and the section below records what closing it cost. The
 *      sentence that used to stand here said widening to `scripts/__tests__`
 *      "would make nearly every markdown document in the tree a test input,
 *      which is a different ruling". That was right about the population and
 *      wrong about nothing else: it IS a different ruling, it was measured, and
 *      it was made. Nothing is excluded from the scan today.
 *   2. **A read the scanner cannot see.** It resolves string literals and
 *      recognises directory walks. A test that computes a path from parts no
 *      literal carries, or reads markdown through a helper module in another
 *      file, is invisible to it -- and therefore invisible to the audit. No
 *      static scan closes that; what closes it is a reviewer adding the entry.
 *   3. **Whether the test would actually FAIL.** The question here is whether
 *      the document is an INPUT, not whether a given edit to it changes an
 *      assertion. Answering the second one requires running the test, which is
 *      exactly what the caller is deciding whether to do.
 *   4. **Non-markdown inputs.** A test reading a JSON fixture or a `.txt`
 *      corpus is the same shape of hazard, but those paths are not on the
 *      workflow's exclusion list, so they already force a full run.
