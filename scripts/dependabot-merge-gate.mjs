/**
 * The merge gate `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml` consults before
 * it approves or enqueues a Dependabot pull request (objectui#4973).
 *
 * ## What went wrong, measured
 *
 * The workflow used to run, unconditionally, for every semver-patch/minor bump:
 *
 *     gh pr merge --auto --squash "$PR_URL"
 *
 * `--auto` lands the merge the moment GitHub considers the pull request
 * mergeable — that is, the moment the *branch-protection required set* is
 * satisfied. It does NOT wait for the checks this repository actually runs. On
 * 2026-08-17 that difference was cashed in on #4959 (`lucide-react` 1.29.0 ->
 * 1.31.0), whose own head SHA `31745d8b` was red:
 *
 *   08:07:41Z  PR opened
 *   08:13:07Z  the four `Test (shard N/4)` jobs start
 *   08:13:30Z  this workflow's own `dependabot` job completes
 *   08:13:36Z  github-actions[bot] MERGES it into `main`
 *   08:18:55Z  shard 4/4 reports success
 *   08:21:01Z  shard 3/4 reports FAILURE   (5m25s after the merge)
 *   08:21:56Z  shard 1/4 reports FAILURE   (8m20s after the merge)
 *   08:22:33Z  `Type Check` reports        (8m57s after the merge)
 *
 * Nine of the nineteen check runs on that SHA were still in flight when the
 * merge happened — all four shards, `Type Check`, `Lint`, `Build & E2E`,
 * `Build Docs` and `Bundle Analysis`. The four-way test shard matrix is the
 * slowest job in the repository BY CONSTRUCTION (it exists to cut a ~9 minute
 * wall clock, see `ci.yml`), so it is the check that `--auto` systematically
 * outruns. `main` went red for every parallel agent, which is what #4968 then
 * had to repair.
 *
 * The hole is not specific to lockfile ranges: ANY red on a slow job could ride
 * through it. Same family as objectui#3523 (an empty merge-queue required set
 * let #3503/#3510/#3516 land with `Type Check` at conclusion=failure) and
 * #3243.
 *
 * ## Why this is a script and not a `run:` block
 *
 * Same reason `scripts/render-budget-comment.mjs` and
 * `scripts/shadcn-check-report.mjs` exist: logic that lives in YAML is logic
 * nothing ever executes between real firings, and this particular logic decides
 * whether something lands on the shared `main`. Here it buys something extra —
 * `scripts/__tests__/dependabot-merge-gate.test.ts` replays the REAL #4959
 * check-run timeline through `evaluateGate()` and asserts the counterfactual
 * directly: `pending` at 08:13:36Z (so the merge does not happen) and `red`
 * once the shards report. A workflow cannot be run locally; this decision can.
 *
 * ## The contract: declared = enforced, and absence is never green
 *
 * The gate does NOT ask GitHub "are the required checks green?" — that question
 * is answered by the branch-protection required set, which is a
 * repository-SETTINGS surface this repository can neither read nor change
 * (`content/docs/guide/ci-cd-pipeline.md`, "Merge Queue", step 3), and which is
 * demonstrably not carrying the shards today: a merge occurred while all four
 * were `in_progress`, so none of them can be in it.
 *
 * So the set is declared here, and three rules keep the declaration honest:
 *
 *  1. Every context in `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS` must be PRESENT and `success`.
 *     Missing counts as not-green, never as green — a renamed or skipped job
 *     must stall the gate and then fail it, which is the one direction that
 *     cannot silently let a red PR through. (objectui#3523's lesson stated the
 *     other way round: a check that never reports does not fail a required-set
 *     rule, it leaves the PR pending — so a gate that reads "absent = fine" is
 *     the same bug wearing the fix's clothes.)
 *  2. `OPTIONAL_CONTEXTS` are blocking checks whose WORKFLOW carries a
 *     trigger-level path filter, so they legitimately do not report on every
 *     pull request. Present -> must be `success`; absent -> not waited for.
 *  3. `NOT_A_GATE` names every remaining context a pull request produces, each
 *     with the reason it cannot gate. `dependabot-merge-gate.test.ts` asserts
 *     the three buckets partition the produced set EXACTLY — no name produced
 *     by a `pull_request`-triggered workflow may be unclassified, and no
 *     classified name may be unproduced. A new job or a renamed one fails that
 *     test instead of quietly shrinking the gate.
 *
 * Only `success` is green for a required context. `skipped` is not: every
 * required context here belongs to a workflow that reports on every pull
 * request by design (the path decision moved INTO the jobs in #3523, so an
 * ignored-paths run still reports `success`), which means a `skipped` required
 * context is a change in the pipeline, not a pass.
 *
 * ## What this file deliberately does not do
 *
 * It never mutates anything — no merge, no approval, no comment. It reads check
 * runs and returns a verdict; the workflow performs the two mutations, under an
 * `if:` on that verdict, so the whole set of things that can write is visible
 * in the YAML. A crash here (403 on `checks: read`, network, bad input) exits
 * non-zero and merges nothing, which is the correct direction to fail.
 *
 * ## The boundary of the declared set: check RUNS, not commit STATUSES
 *
 * Everything above is about check runs — what GitHub Actions jobs produce.
 * Third-party apps can also attach a legacy commit STATUS to the same SHA, and
 * this repository has one: `Vercel`, which on a pull request reports
 * `success` / "Canceled by Ignored Build Step" for changes its ignored-build
 * step filters out. The gate does not read statuses, so a red Vercel status
 * would not stop a Dependabot merge.
 *
 * That is a stated boundary, not an oversight, and it is not a regression: the
 * unconditional `--auto` this replaced waited for nothing at all. It is left
 * outside deliberately — requiring a preview deployment from a third-party
 * service would let an unrelated outage block every dependency bump, and
 * whether that trade is worth making is a maintainer's call, not a hot fix's.
 * It is written down here so the next reader does not have to infer the scope
 * from the endpoint being called.

 * draft for the maintainer is the healthy case, and a check red on the healthy
 * case is a permanently red check (objectui#6596). Its refusal lives on the
 * `merge_group` leg. Listing it here is still correct and still load-bearing:
 * this list is what `merge-queue-reporting.test.ts` derives the `merge_group`
 * subscription floor from, and a guard whose whole point is the queue build must
 * be inside that floor. It also costs a Dependabot bump nothing — such a diff
 * touches no governed path, so the check reports CLEAR without making a single
 * API call.
 *
