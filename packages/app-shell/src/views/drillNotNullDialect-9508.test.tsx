/**
 * objectui#9508 — the drill URL dialect can finally spell IS NOT NULL, and its
 * three sibling producer spellings stop vanishing on the escape hatch.
 *
 * `convertFiltersToAST` lowers four producer spellings onto two operators:
 * `{ $null: true }` / `{ $exists: false }` to `is_null`, and `{ $null: false }`
 * / `{ $exists: true }` to `is_not_null`. objectui#9159 taught this dialect the
 * first of them. The other three had no spelling, so a drill carrying one
 * VANISHED here and the list page opened scoped by everything except the
 * condition the user clicked — a silent superset, the same shape objectui#9159
 * measured, for the sibling spellings.
 *
 * ## Why the observation point is the DESTINATION SCOPE
 *
 * Same reason objectui#9159 gave: the defect's whole signature is that every
 * layer looks healthy — the widget renders, the navigation happens, the list
 * loads, and only the row set is wrong. So the escape hatch is driven for real
 * (`useOpenRecordList` inside a router) and the assertion is on the triples the
 * bare data surface reads back out of the URL. A map-only assertion passes on a
 * dialect that still cannot express the condition end to end.
 *
 * ## The two routes deliver DIFFERENT spellings — measured, not assumed
 *
 * ⭐ This is why the write side reads both producer keys rather than only the
 * canonical one:
 *
 *   - COMPOSED: `composeDrillFilter` lowers `widget.filter ∧ click context`
 *     through the spec's `parseFilterAST`, which canonicalises `is_not_null`
 *     back to `{ $null: false }`. An authored `$exists` therefore never
 *     survives this route, and the card's own table reads as if it does.
 *   - UNCOMPOSED: a widget that hands its OWN resolved filter straight to the
 *     escape hatch passes through no canonicaliser at all, so `$exists`
 *     reaches the serializer verbatim. `ObjectMetricWidget` is that widget —
 *     it gives `DrillDownDrawer` its `resolvedFilter`, which the drawer's
 *     `OpenInListButton` hands to `openRecordList` unchanged.
 *
 * ⇒ reading only `$null` would have closed the composed route and left the
 * uncomposed one degrading exactly as before, for an author who picked "is not
 * empty" in the dataset filter inspector (which writes the `$exists` pair).
 *
 * ## What this card did NOT change
 *
 * ⚠️ `buildDatasetDrillFilter` — the DATASET drill's own click context — still
 * emits `{ $null: true }` and nothing else, so no machine producer on that path
 * reaches the new spellings. That is re-measured below with a lit control
 * rather than inherited from the card, and it is why this is a latent-surface
 * repair: the reachable route is an AUTHORED widget filter, not a click.
