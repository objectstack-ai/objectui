/**
 * Refuse a relationship field whose target is unusable — BEFORE the PUT.
 *
 * ## The failure this closes, measured in a running designer
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 made `reference` a hard requirement on `lookup`
 * and `master_detail` (a `custom` refinement at path `reference`, not an
 * `unrecognized_keys` name refusal). At 17.2.0 the requirement was prose only —
 * `{ type: 'lookup', label: 'L' }` parsed green at field level AND through
 * `ObjectSchema` — so the designer was free to persist a target-less draft and
 * did.
 *
 * objectui#7714 drove that against a real 17.3.0 backend rather than inferring
 * it. Creating a `lookup` and leaving its target empty PUT the whole object and
 * got `422 INVALID_METADATA` at `fields.<name>.reference`; the next edit — to a
 * DIFFERENT, already-saved field — was refused identically, because the
 * half-filled draft rides along in the same document. The author sees the later
 * edit rendered as applied while the server has none of it, and the only escape
 * that does not require noticing the lookup is a reload, which discards it.
 * That is the cost of letting the draft leave the client: not one failed save,
 * but every subsequent save of that object for the rest of the session.
 *
 * ## Why this raises instead of letting the server answer
 *
 * The maintainer's reconciliation (objectui#7122 ruled item 4, 2026-09-05) is
 * that the incomplete draft stays in the client and is never PUT: an editing
 * session's half-finished work belongs to the client, not to the metadata
 * store. ⛔ Not the alternative of stripping the incomplete field out of the
 * body while still reporting a successful save — that shows the author a field
 * the server never received, the silent-drop shape objectstack#4001 closed.
 *
 * ## Why an exception, and why HERE
 *
 * Same mechanism, same reason and the same call site as the nameless-field and
 * duplicate-name refusals below: it raises before the request, so a refused
 * list issues NO PUT AT ALL, and the designer page runs its save inside a `try`
 * whose `catch` already renders the message in the page's existing error
 * surface. No new UI affordance is introduced — the author sees the same banner
 * a nameless or duplicated field already produces.
 *
 * `MetadataFieldsPage` carries the sibling copy for the same reason it carries
 * the sibling `toFieldsMap` and `carryOver`: the two writers convert different
 * input types on different paths and neither owns the other's. Both are pinned,
 * and each pin asserts the same four states so the copies cannot drift.
 *
 * ## The `.trim()` is a DECLARED DIVERGENCE, not an accident
 *
 * The predicate is `typeof reference === 'string' && reference.trim() !== ''`,
 * which is STRICTER than the contract. Measured on 17.3.0, at field level and
 * again through the whole document:
 *
 *   FieldSchema.safeParse({ type: 'lookup', label: 'L', reference: '   ' })
 *     => success = true
 *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ …, fields: { rel: { …, reference: '   ' } } })
 *     => success = true
 *
 * — the spec ACCEPTS a whitespace-only target and this writer refuses it.
 * objectui being stricter than the platform is a divergence, not a neutral
 * choice, so it is STATED here rather than left to be inferred from a
 * predicate: undeclared, it is indistinguishable from a bug and the next reader
 * "fixes" it.
 *
 * ⭐ Kept, deliberately. A whitespace-only `reference` names no object — the
 * spec's own `ObjectSchema.fields` key grammar (`/^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$/`) admits
 * no whitespace-bearing name for it to resolve to — so admitting it buys the
 * author nothing and only moves the identical failure past the guard, past the
 * PUT and into a STORED document, where it surfaces with no field named and no
 * save to attach the message to.
 *
 * ⚠️ Filed upstream as objectstack#16126 (open, `domain:spec`). If the spec
 * trims, this writer's behaviour is unchanged and only the declaration retires
 * — which is why the pins assert the writer's refusal separately from the
 * spec's verdict.

 * and has no field-level ordering key at all (objectui#6045), so insertion
 * order here IS the designer's order.
 *
 * ## Why a missing name THROWS instead of writing `{ undefined: … }`
 *
 * The key can only come from the field's `name`. Both writer inputs declare it
 * required (`FieldMetadataPayload.name`, `DesignerFieldDefinition.name`), but
 * neither writer owns its input at runtime: `saveObject`'s `existingFields` is
 * public API (`MetadataService` is reachable from app-shell's barrel through

 * So the loud, immediate, harmless array-shaped 422 would have been traded for
 * a silently corrupt STORED document. That is the AI-authored-metadata failure
 * mode this repo keeps closing, and this conversion is exactly where it would
 * have been opened.
 *
 * ## Why a duplicate name throws too
 *
 * That one is the conversion's OWN hazard rather than an inherited one: an
 * array can carry two entries named `n` and a map cannot, so the later entry
 * would silently swallow the earlier. Refusing is the only reading that does
 * not lose a field the caller declared.
 *
 * ## Why `Object.fromEntries` and not assignment into a literal
 *
 * `map['__proto__'] = field` does not create a key — it invokes the prototype
 * setter — and `__proto__` is a SPEC-LEGAL field name (the record's key schema
 * is `/^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$/`). The assignment form would therefore drop such a
 * field silently, which is this function's whole subject wearing a different
 * spelling. `Object.fromEntries` defines an own property instead.

 * That loss is not new but was unreachable: while `fields` went out as an array
 * the whole body was refused `422` before persistence (objectui#6240), so
 * nothing this dropped ever reached storage. From that fix onward it does.
 *
 * ## Why the modelled keys are still written UNCONDITIONALLY
 *
 * The mirror hazard, and the one thing that would make this fix worse than the
 * bug: carry-over must not resurrect a value the author deliberately CLEARED.
 * Every key below is named on every call, so a cleared property arrives as an
 * explicit `undefined` that OVERRIDES the carried value and is then dropped by
 * `JSON.stringify` — absent from the body, which on an upsert is the deletion.
 * A conditional spread (`...(field.x ? { x: field.x } : {})`) would leave the
 * server's old value standing and fail the author's deletion silently. Pinned
 * both ways in `MetadataService.fieldKeyCarryOver.test.ts`.
 *
 * It no longer copies `sortOrder` (objectui#6045). `FieldSchema` refuses that
 * key by name and nothing on the tree ever populated it, so the write was
 * latent — `JSON.stringify` drops the `undefined` — but one reorder feature
 * away from a hard 422 that blocks every later save of the object.

   * that body. Neither key is a metadata convention:
   *
   *   - `enabled` and `_deleted` are refused BY NAME by 25 of the 26 overlay
   *     schemas the framework validates a PUT against (`getMetadataTypeSchema`,
   *     the registry `saveMetaItem`'s `resolveOverlaySchema` reads), `object`
   *     among them: `422 INVALID_METADATA`, `unrecognized_keys`.
   *   - Where the type's schema is tolerant (`view`) or unregistered
   *     (`analytics_cube`, `connector`, `sharing_rule`, `webhook`) the body is
   *     STORED VERBATIM — the framework persists the request item, never
   *     `parsed.data` — and `_deleted` has no reader anywhere in the platform.
   *     So on exactly the categories that did not 422, the "soft delete" was a
   *     silent no-op that left the item live carrying two junk keys.
   *
   * There was no third outcome: nothing strips the keys, and no spec surface
   * expresses "this item exists but is off" (`ObjectSchema`'s 42-key accept set
   * has no such flag), so there is no correct spelling this could be renamed
   * to. The delete door is `DELETE /:type/:name` — generic over `:type` on the
   * same route family and capability gate as the PUT — which is the same
   * request `MetadataClient.reset` issues for `MetadataObjectsPage`'s object
   * deletes and `ResourceEditPage`'s generic ones. One operation, one mechanism.
   *
   * **Still not wired to the view seam, and the reason is unchanged and
   * structural** (objectui#4373): both view cache keys are OBJECT-scoped and
   * this signature has no object parameter. The old tombstone body carried no
   * object binding to derive one from; a DELETE has no body at all, so it
   * carries even less. Splitting `name` on `.` would be a second,
   * silently-wrong identity rule (a source-declared view's name is not
   * qualified), and inventing an object argument for a method with no callers
   * is a surface we would be guessing at. If a `'view'` caller ever appears,
   * the fix is to give it the object it already knows and call

   * ## Why `existingFields` is REQUIRED (objectui#6490)
   *
   * `ObjectSchema.fields` is not merely typed, it is REQUIRED. Measured against
   * the installed `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0:
   *
   *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ name: 'account', label: 'Account' })
   *     => success = false   invalid_type @ fields
   *
   * and `metadata-protocol`'s `saveMetaItem` parses the whole item against that
   * same schema and throws BEFORE it persists. So a call that omitted the field
   * list built a body the server was guaranteed to refuse with
   * `422 INVALID_METADATA` — this method cannot write a valid document without
   * it. Requiring the argument moves that guaranteed RUNTIME failure to compile
   * time; runtime accept/reject is unchanged, because the only calls it breaks
   * are calls that already failed, every time they ran.
   *
   * An EMPTY list is a different statement from a missing one, and it is
   * accepted: `[]` says "this object has no fields", writes `{}`, and under the
   * upsert that is a field wipe the caller asked for — the same authoritative
   * reading `saveFields` gives its own empty list. Pinned alongside the
   * anti-wipe control in `MetadataService.objectPayloadFieldsMap.test.ts`, so
   * the two readings of "no fields" stay distinguishable.
   *
   * Two readings were declined by the maintainer ruling (2026-08-27), recorded
   * here so neither returns as a shortcut:
   *
   *   - ⛔ **Not a `{}` default.** `{}` parses GREEN, so defaulting would delete
   *     every field of the object on a save that only meant to rename it —
   *     trading a loud, harmless 422 for silent data loss. `toObjectPayload`
   *     still omits the key for an input that supplies nothing, and that branch
   *     is still reachable: this class is public API through
   *     `useMetadataService`, so a JavaScript consumer, or one that casts past
   *     the types, can arrive there. What it must get is the 422, not the wipe.
   *   - ⛔ **Not fetch-and-merge.** `saveFields` GETs the current document and
   *     spreads it, and an object save could preserve the stored `fields` the
   *     same way — but that builds capability for a path with zero measured
   *     pull and makes this parameter redundant, which then wants retiring on
   *     its own terms (ADR-0049 shape).

   *     model, and reshaping `fields` must not cost that. It now matters more
   *     than it did, not less: while the body was refused, nothing it preserved
   *     ever reached storage.
   *   - **The field list is AUTHORITATIVE, so an empty one writes `{}`.** That
   *     is the opposite of `saveObject`'s optional `existingFields`, and the
   *     asymmetry is the point: here the designer is stating the object's
   *     complete field set, so "no fields" is a thing it can mean; there, a
   *     missing argument means the caller did not say.
   *
   * …and a third, pinned in `MetadataService.readDecorationStrip.test.ts`:
   *
   *   - **The framework's own read decorations do NOT go back out**
   *     (objectui#6480). The same spread that preserves unknown server keys
   *     also carries `_diagnostics` and `_draft` — keys the framework ADDS to a
   *     served document and `ObjectSchema` refuses by name — so the body is
   *     passed through the spec's `stripReadDecorations` before it is sent.
   *     Note the direction this cuts: the preservation property above is about
   *     keys the AUTHOR owns, and this one is about keys the FRAMEWORK owns.
   *     Only the second kind may be dropped, and only because the read path
   *     regenerates them.
   *
   * …and a fourth, pinned in `MetadataService.fieldKeyCarryOver.test.ts`:
   *
   *   - **Per-FIELD server keys are carried over** (objectui#6488). The spread
   *     above is object-level and does nothing for keys INSIDE a field, so
   *     entries rebuilt from the designer model dropped every key the server
   *     sent that this converter does not name — `expression`, `precision`,
   *     `scale`, `system`, `sortable`, anything a plugin registered. The
   *     previous entries ride in on the very document this method already
   *     fetched, so `toFieldPayload` merges onto them; see there for the mirror
   *     property that keeps a CLEARED designer property cleared.
