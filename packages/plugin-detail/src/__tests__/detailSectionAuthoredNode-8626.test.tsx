/**
 * objectui#8626 — an authored `detail-section` node RENDERS the eight inputs
 * its registration declares.
 *
 * ## What was broken, measured rather than read
 *
 * The registration declares eight FLAT inputs; `DetailSection` declares a
 * single `section` OBJECT prop and reads `section.*` only. `SchemaRenderer`
 * spreads a node's non-metadata keys as React props, so `section` arrived
 * `undefined`.
 *
 * Rendering an authored node through the real `SchemaRenderer` and the real
 * registry on `b775500af` produced, verbatim:
 *
 *   Component "detail-section" failed to render
 *   Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'defaultCollapsed')
 *
 * i.e. `SchemaErrorBoundary`'s banner in place of the block — worse than
 * inert, and the half the card flagged as "a reading and not an execution".
 * `errorBannerAbsent()` below is that exact face, asserted absent.
 *
 * ## Why each row is a RENDERING verdict
 *
 * Every declared input is measured by a consequence in the DOM — the text an
 * author sees, the column track the grid gets, the tint class the header
 * carries. Deliberately NOT "the prop was passed" and NOT "the registration
 * declares eight inputs": both pass on a component that reads none of them,
 * which is precisely the defect. Each class-shaped row carries its own
 * negative (`grid-cols-1` without `md:grid-cols-2`, `bg-muted` without
 * `bg-accent`) so it is a verdict and not a substring that was always there.
 *
 * ## The two guards beside the rendering rows
 *
 * - FOLD PARITY. The fold set and the registration's declared input names are
 *   compared in BOTH directions. A ninth input declared without a fold is the
 *   original defect in miniature — inert, silent — and reds here instead.
 * - THE DECLARED SURFACE DID NOT MOVE. The flat eight still draw ZERO
 *   diagnostics from a manifest built the way `page.tsx` builds the JSX-page
 *   compiler's, and the nested `section` shape is still REFUSED by it. That is
 *   the control on the repair NOT taken: this card folds at the seam, and does
 *   not re-declare the surface authors already write.
