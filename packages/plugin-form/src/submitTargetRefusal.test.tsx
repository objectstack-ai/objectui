 *
 * A form with nothing to submit TO must REFUSE, never confirm (objectui#6300).
 *
 * ## What went wrong
 *
 * Each of the five variant containers opened `handleSubmit` with
 *
 *     if (!dataSource) { await schema.onSuccess?.(data); return data; }
 *
 * — a success signal emitted without consulting `submitHandler` and without
 * persisting anything. Re-derived on the merged tree (2e11c8c5b), driving each
 * `formType` through `ObjectForm` with a `submitHandler` declared and NO
 * `dataSource`:
 *
 *     variant | rendered | onSuccess | submitHandler
 *     tabbed  |   yes    |     1     |      0
 *     wizard  |   yes    |     1     |      0
 *     split   |   yes    |     1     |      0
 *     drawer  |   yes    |     1     |      0
 *     modal   |   yes    |     1     |      0
 *     simple  |   NO     |     0     |      0   ← never renders a form at all
 *
 * The `simple` row is the contrast, and it is not "throws on submit":
 * `SimpleObjectForm` refuses at LOAD — with no `dataSource` and no inline
 * `customFields` its schema effect takes the branch it comments as "cannot
 * proceed" and no submittable form is ever mounted, so its
 * `'DataSource is required for form submission'` throw is not reached on this
 * path. The five variants build their fields from `sections` and therefore DO
 * render, which is why the refusal has to live at submit time for them.
 *
 * ## Why it is user-reachable, not just a unit-level oddity
 *
 * `MasterDetailForm` builds its parent schema with BOTH
 * `submitHandler: submitViaBatch` and `onSuccess: handleSaved`. The early
 * return jumped straight to `handleSaved`, measured on the merged tree as
 * `toast.success("Created")` — plus, in create mode, a `formKey` bump that
 * remounts and CLEARS the parent form. The submitter is told the save worked
 * and watches their input disappear, with nothing written and
 * `submitViaBatch` (which would have said `dataSource is required`) never
 * called. That is the half this file pins in `describe` block 5.
 *
 * ## The sixth renderer (objectui#6388)
 *
 * `SimpleObjectForm` had the same hole in its own dialect. Its carve-out reads
 * `hasInlineFields && !dataSource` — non-empty `customFields`, its own inline
 * field source — and it too opened `handleSubmit`, ahead of the persistence
 * chain. Re-derived on the merged tree (faa863dce) with `customFields`, a
 * `submitHandler` and NO `dataSource`: `onSuccess 1 / submitHandler 0`. Its
 * cases live in blocks 1 and 3 beside the family's, on a `customFields`
 * fixture: under `simple`, `sections[].fields` only SELECT fields already
 * resolved from `customFields` or the object schema, so the sectioned fixture
 * above renders no fields at all there — which is also why `simple` keeps its
 * own predicate rather than `hasInlineFieldSource` (block 3's `simple`
 * BOUNDARY case pins that).
 *
 * ## The blocks below
 *
 * 1. the declared `submitHandler` seam is consulted with no `dataSource`;
 * 2. no seam, no adapter, no inline fields → refuse loudly;
 * 3. CARVE-OUT — a legitimate inline-fields form still works, in BOTH the
 *    shapes this package documents (`customFields`, and sections of inline
 *    runtime fields — the README's own wizard example), plus the boundary case
 *    that keeps the carve-out from widening into a blanket escape;
 * 4. DEGENERATE CONTROL — `dataSource` present, the write really happens, so
 *    blocks 1-2 are attributable to its ABSENCE and not to a blanket change;
 * 5. the `MasterDetailForm` reachability path.
