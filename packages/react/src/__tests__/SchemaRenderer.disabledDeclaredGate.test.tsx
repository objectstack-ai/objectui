/**
 * objectui#3862 — `SchemaRenderer`'s inline `disabled` gate asked
 * `newSchema.disabled !== undefined`, the WIDEST of the three spellings this
 * repo had for "is a gate declared?", on the one key where width is not free.
 *
 * `evaluateCondition` answers an empty predicate with `true` — "no condition, so
 * visible/enabled". On `visible` that `true` is negated and means SHOW, which is
 * what "no gate" means anyway, so the `visible` chain above is benign. On
 * `disabled` it means GREY. So `disabled: ''` set `_disabled = true`, and one
 * notch wider than the `!= null` family, so did `disabled: null`.
 *
 * Two things make this the generic-path defect rather than one renderer's:
 *
 *   • the block runs in the `evaluatedSchema` useMemo with no type branch, so it
 *     covers EVERY node that renders through `SchemaRenderer`.
 *   • `_disabled` is not an internal marker. It is stripped from
 *     `componentProps` and re-injected as `disabled: __disabled || undefined`,
 *     so any component taking a `disabled` prop — inputs, buttons, form fields —
 *     is really disabled. That forwarding is pinned below, because "the flag is
 *     not set" and "the prop does not arrive" are different claims and only the
 *     second is what a user sees.
 *
 * The fix reads core's one definition (`hasDeclaredPredicate`, objectui#3850's
 * ruling) instead of adding a fourth local spelling — the `&& !== ''` this card
 * explicitly ruled out.
 *
 * ## What each case detects
 *
 *   • `disabled: ''` / `null` / `'   '` / `{ dialect, source: '' }` /
 *     `{ source: '' }` → NOT disabled, and no `disabled` prop forwarded. THE
 *     defect. `''` and `null` are the two rows the card measured; the envelope is
 *     objectui#3850's shape reaching this path too.
 *   • `disabled: true` / a truthy expression / a truthy CEL envelope → still
 *     disabled. Anti-mutation guards: "never disable" satisfies most of this file
 *     alone, and these refuse it.
 *   • `disabled: false` → still not disabled, and `disabled: 0` → not disabled
 *     (junk fails open, as it now does at every other gate).
 *   • `disabledOn` in each of those directions → the alias reads the same
 *     definition, not a copy of it.
 *   • precedence: an EMPTY `disabled` no longer short-circuits the chain, so a
 *     declared `disabledOn` is finally consulted. This case is the one that would
 *     stay green if someone "fixed" the defect by deleting the `disabled` leg.
 *   • the `visible` chain, unchanged: it keeps `!== undefined` (its alias
 *     precedence is load-bearing and its `true` is benign), so `visible: ''`
 *     still renders and `visible: false` still hides.
 *   • the `hidden` / `hiddenOn` legs of that same chain, which are NOT negated
 *     and therefore HAD this defect with the polarity that makes the node
 *     VANISH. Measured while writing the equivalence cases, out of this ruling's
 *     scope, filed as objectui#3955 and pinned here as a documented divergence
 *     rather than left for the next reader to rediscover; that divergence case is
 *     now a convergence case, and the full table for both legs lives in
 *     `SchemaRenderer.hiddenDeclaredGate.test.tsx`.
 *   • the empty shapes include the blank-`source` envelope since objectui#3960
 *     widened the shared definition — the same rows, one spelling longer.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted before running)
 *
 * Restoring `newSchema.disabled !== undefined` / `disabledOn !== undefined` must
 * turn RED exactly the seven empty-shape cases on each key (`disabled`,
 * `disabledOn`), their forwarding cases, the `0` junk case and the precedence
 * case — and leave every `true` / `false` / expression / `visible` case GREEN.
 * Nothing here can go red in the other direction: the change only ever removes a
 * `disabled` prop, never adds one.
 *
 * Reverting the objectui#3960 half alone (envelope blankness, in core's shared
 * definition) turns RED only the two blank-`source` rows on each key.
