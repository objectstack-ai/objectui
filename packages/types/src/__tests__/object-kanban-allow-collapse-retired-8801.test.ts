/**
 * objectui#8801 — `ObjectKanbanSchema.allowCollapse` RETIRED on the
 * `object-kanban` arm, on BOTH faces (ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove; director
 * seat, class-1 self-adjudication of 2026-09-16, letter A).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The key was declared on the TypeScript face and on the zod mirror, and read
 * by NO registered board. An author who wrote `allowCollapse: true` on an
 * `object-kanban` node type-checked green, parsed green, and got a board that
 * never collapsed anything off it — a published entry point to a capability
 * that does not exist behind it.
 *
 * ## Why removal rather than a reader
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s `ComponentPropsMap['object-kanban']` —
 * `ObjectKanbanPropsSchema` — never declared the key, and it is a
 * `strictObject`, so the platform already refuses an authored `allowCollapse`
 * by name at publish. The two faces disagreed with the protocol and with each
 * other's consequences: `tsc` said yes and the document was rejected whole.
 * Wiring a reader instead was refused by the same ruling as a capability
 * nobody asked for.
 *
 * ## Why a TOMBSTONE rather than a deleted member
 *
 * `BaseSchema` carries `[key: string]: any` and its mirror ends
 * `.passthrough()`, so a deleted member is KEPT, not refused — one silent
 * no-op traded for another. The member stays declared and unwritable: `?: never`
 * on the interface, `retirementTombstone()` on the mirror. Suite "the near
 * miss" below is what separates the two outcomes on one instrument.
 *
 * ## ⛔ NOT inherited from the sibling arm
 *
 * Batch #70 (objectui#7742) tombstoned the same spelling on `KanbanSchema`, and
 * objectui#8802 then removed that arm whole. Those refusals were arm-scoped by
 * construction — a `type: "object-kanban"` document went on being accepted, and
 * `bare-kanban-node-key-retired-8802.test.ts` pinned exactly that. This
 * retirement is a separate ruling on this arm's own protocol row, and that
 * sibling pin's `allowCollapse` row moved here rather than being deleted.
