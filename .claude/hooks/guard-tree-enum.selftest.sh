# Self-test for guard-tree-enum.sh — run it after touching that hook:
#
#   .claude/hooks/guard-tree-enum.selftest.sh
#
# Feeds the hook the same JSON payload shape Claude Code delivers on PreToolUse and asserts
# the block/allow verdict per command. Needs jq (to build payloads) and nothing else: no
# install, no build, no network. Exit 0 = all cases hold.
#
# The first case is THIS repository's measured incident of 2026-08-29 (objectstack#13305)
# reproduced verbatim; it is the one case whose failure means the guard has stopped doing
# the only job it was written for.
#
# Mirrored one-for-one from objectstack's self-test of the same name alongside the hook, so
# the two repos' guards cannot drift; only example paths are localised.
