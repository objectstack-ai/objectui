/**
 * `buttonVariant` reaches the REGISTRY face of `toast` and `sonner`
 * (objectui#7316).
 *
 * The key was real end to end and invisible anyway: `ToastSchema` and
 * `SonnerSchema` both declare it as the same six-member union, both renderers
 * pass it straight into `<Button variant={…}>` — and both registrations left it
 * out of `inputs`. `toast-button-variant-parity.test.ts` next door already pins
 * the TS face, the zod mirror and the Button against each other; NONE of those
 * three is the registry, so the omission survived all of them.
 *
 * ## Why the omission was not merely cosmetic
 *
 * `inputs` is what the JSX-page compiler builds its prop whitelist from
 * (`renderers/layout/page.tsx`, `getJsxManifest`), and `sdui-parser`'s
 * `validateTree` reports every prop that is not in it as `unknown-prop`. So
 * before this change an author writing `buttonVariant` on a page was WARNED
 * about a key the renderer then went on to honour — objectui#3808 named that
 * exact failure for `element:text_input.defaultValue`, and this is the same
 * one. The designer property panel and the palette read the same array.
 *
 * ## Why `enum` and not `string`
 *
 * `cva` contributes NO variant class for a key it does not recognise and falls
 * back to `defaultVariants` only when the value is absent OR falsy. So
 * `buttonVariant: 'primary'` draws a button with no background and no text
 * colour, and `buttonVariant: ''` silently draws the default look. A `string`
 * arm leaves both writable in silence. An `enum` arm is the ONE arm
 * `validateTree` judges exactly — the `invalid-enum` block below measures that
 * it answers `error`, not `warning` — so declaring the closed list is what
 * turns those two traps into a named refusal at authoring time.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is restated
 *
 * The expected vocabulary is READ from the two zod mirrors, which objectui#6541
 * closed over exactly the Button vocabulary, and every member is then measured
 * against `buttonVariants` itself. A list typed in by hand is the artefact this
 * whole family of cards keeps producing.
 *
 * ⛔ The two registrations are SEPARATE surfaces. Every assertion below names
 * one node or asserts the two against each other, so a fix applied to one of
 * them cannot be scored as a fix to both.
