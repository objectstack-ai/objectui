/**
 * Retirement pin — `DashboardComponentSchema.aria` (objectui#5830).
 *
 * The spec removed `dashboard.aria` at the #3896 audit close-out ("no
 * dashboard renderer ever applied it"): `DashboardSchema.shape.aria` in
 * `@objectstack/spec/ui` is a tombstone that refuses any value and tells
 * authors to delete the key. objectui's Zod twin inherits that refusal by
 * reference (`SpecDashboardFields`, `zod/complex.zod.ts` — `aria` is not in
 * its exclusion list), and `packages/plugin-dashboard/src` has no
 * `schema.aria` read site (pinned by that package's
 * `dashboardAuthoredInputs.test.tsx`). The TS interface was the last surface
 * still DECLARING the key — under a comment claiming alignment with
 * `AriaPropsSchema`, the opposite of the contract: the member-level instance
 * of #4631's "declared surfaces disagree".
 *
 * What the deletion changed at the type level, stated honestly: `BaseSchema`
 * carries `[key: string]: any`, so after the removal an authored `aria:` on a
 * dashboard literal still COMPILED — it fell to the index signature, and a
 * `@ts-expect-error` pin on an authored literal could not stick.
 *
 * objectui#9736 closed that half. The interface now extends the spec's own
 * `Dashboard` input type (`Omit< Dashboard, … >` over the exclusion list its
 * mirror reads), so it inherits the spec's tombstone as a DECLARED member typed
 * `undefined` — `aria` is back in the declared key set, but only as a refusal,
 * and an authored value is a compile error: the same verdict the Zod twin gives
 * at parse. The pins below assert exactly that, with the former neighbours as
 * the control. Real enforcement because `packages/types/tsconfig.test.json` is
 * chained from this package's `type-check` script (#3009).
