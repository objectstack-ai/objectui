 * objectui#8253 / objectui#8841 — `TreeViewConfig`'s key census is total over
 * the PROTOCOL, its readers agree with it, and the module-local copy it
 * replaced is GONE rather than shadowed.
 *
 * ## The card
 *
 * `tree` is a host-composition-only view type (objectui#5321 ruling B): on
 * neither authored union, reached only when a host passes a `views` prop. The
 * per-view `tree` block that path reads had NO exported type — its only
 * description was the module-local `interface TreeConfig` in
 * `plugin-tree/src/ObjectTree.tsx`. The live host is the console, which stores
 * view records and passes them as `views`, so a real consumer wrote this block
 * against nothing and a misspelled key was stored, dropped and never reported.
 * Ruled option (a) on objectui#8253 (decision batch #78, 2026-09-07, maintainer
 * 「同意」): export the config, import it at the reader, ⛔ no second copy.
 *
 * ## What this file owns, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * It owns the DERIVED half — the part a type-level pin cannot see:
 *
 *   - the private interface is gone from the reader;
 *   - the reader imports the exported name instead;
 *   - the resolver's local `ResolvedTreeConfig` is `Pick`ed off the one
 *     declaration rather than hand-written beside it;
 *   - all four reader sites are where this census says they are.
 *
 * It does NOT own reachability through the published `exports` map. That is
 * unassertable from inside this package — `tsconfig.test.json` here sets
 * `"paths": {}` AND there is no self-link in `packages/types/node_modules`, so
 * `@object-ui/types` is not a specifier this project can resolve at all. It is
 * pinned from a CONSUMER instead, in
 * `plugin-tree/src/ObjectTree.hostConfigExported-8253.test.ts`, whose own
 * `"paths": {}` sends the specifier through the workspace dependency to
 * `packages/types/dist/index.d.ts`. Two files, two halves, neither redundant.
 *
 * ## What objectui#8841 changed (and why the census stopped being a list)
 *
 * objectui#8253's export was a hand-written INTERFACE — the protocol's
 * `ListView.tree` block, copied under a second name — and it declared a fifth
 * key, `titleField`, that `@objectstack/spec@17.4.0` refuses on that block by
 * name. The pins here did not catch it because `DECLARED` was AUTHORED beside
 * the type: the list was written to match the drift, so it agreed with the
 * defect and stayed green. objectui#8841 derives the type from the protocol and
 * checks `DECLARED` against `TreeConfigSchema`'s own shape in both directions,
 * so the list can no longer drift silently — only loudly.
 *
 * ## Every zero below has a firing control
 *
 * A `not.toMatch` is worth nothing until the same instrument is shown matching
 * something that IS there. Each negative assertion is paired with a positive
 * one on the same regex family and the same file.
