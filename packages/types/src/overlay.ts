   * down, at the value instead of the key. The pin measures every declared
   * value AND every undeclared one, so widening the union without widening the
   * mechanism reds.
   *
   * ⭐ The DOM reading, not the wiring, is the contract: the pin
   * `packages/components/src/__tests__/alert-dialog-action-variant-8978.test.tsx`
   * reads the confirm button's own `class` off the rendered dialog, with a
