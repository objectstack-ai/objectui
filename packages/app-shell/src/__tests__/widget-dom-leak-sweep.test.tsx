/**
 * MEASUREMENT GATE: the objectui#3291 DOM-leak canary sweep, generalized beyond
 * `packages/fields` to the registry-reachable SDUI widgets of the four packages
 * objectui#4425 named (plugin-charts, plugin-calendar, plugin-chatbot,
 * plugin-dashboard) — and, since objectui#5574, to the renderer family in
 * `packages/components/src/renderers/**`, which is the bulk of what this gate
 * now covers.
 *
 * ## What this is, and what it deliberately is NOT
 *
 * This file landed as phase 1 of objectui#4425: **measure before converging.**
 * It renders every target through the real SDUI path with planted canaries and
 * checks every attribute of every rendered element against what HTML actually
 * defines. It changes **no widget contract and no widget source** — leaks it
 * finds are RECORDED in {@link LEAK_LEDGER} with a reason and an owning issue,
 * never silently tolerated and never fixed here.
 *
 * Phase 2 is now RULED (objectui#4425, comment 5270759246): option 1 —
 * `toDomProps`' whitelist is promoted to the SDUI widget contract, and the
 * migration runs as per-package cards that each delete their own ledger rows.
 * So this gate's job changed without its mechanism changing: it was the
 * measurement the ruling was waiting for, and it is now the ratchet that
 * migration is graded against. The reading, kept at current truth as each card
 * lands:
 *
 *   | package          | targets | targets leaking | leaked attributes |
 *   |------------------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
 *   | plugin-charts    |       9 |               0 |                 0 |
 *   | plugin-calendar  |       3 |               0 |                 0 |
 *   | plugin-chatbot   |       3 |               0 |                 0 |
 *   | plugin-dashboard |       8 |               2 |             7 / 9 |
 *   | components       |     159 |              89 |          12 .. 15 |
 *
 * **91 of 182 targets leak.** The `components` row is objectui#5574 and is
 * covered in its own section below; the two `plugin-dashboard` rows are the
 * older tail. Both are in {@link LEAK_LEDGER}:
 * `plugin-dashboard:metric` and `plugin-dashboard:metric-card`, the open tail
 * objectui#4425 owns directly. Two migration steps have closed their rows since
 * the phase-1 measurement:
 *
 *   - `plugin-chatbot:chatbot` / `chatbot-enhanced` — 14 attributes each,
 *     objectui#4431 / PR #4485, which also lifted `toDomProps` to
 *     `@object-ui/core` so later cards consume one executor.
 *   - `view:dashboard` — `DashboardRenderer`'s widget-grid container, 13
 *     attributes, objectui#4432 / this file's most recent edit.
 *
 * The three packages now reading 0 are NOT clean for the same reason, and the
 * difference is worth keeping straight: `plugin-charts` never spreads the node
 * onto its container at all; `plugin-calendar`'s components take a declared prop
 * list and drop what they do not name, so the node's keys never reach an
 * element; `plugin-chatbot` and `DashboardRenderer`'s grid reach zero by
 * FILTERING — they still spread, through `toDomProps`.
 *
 * `calendar-view` was originally swept with the `events` canary WITHHELD, because
 * authoring it crashed the component outright (objectui#4433) — a worse failure
 * than the leak this gate was looking for, and one that would have read as a
 * clean pass. That is fixed, so the omission is gone and the target is swept
 * with the full canary set; section 5 below carries what is left of it.
 *
 * ## The divergence that decided phase 2, and what is left of it
 *
 * objectui#4425's option 3 was "record the divergence rather than converge".
 * Both answers were live in the tree at once and this gate observed both, which
 * is how the ruling got its evidence:
 *
 *   - a **whitelist** (`toDomProps`, #3291): keep the declared DOM pass-through
 *     keys, drop everything else. Born in `packages/fields`, whose own gate
 *     (`fields/src/__tests__/widget-dom-leak-e2e.test.tsx`) is untouched by this
 *     file and stays the reference implementation of the technique; the
 *     MECHANISM now lives in `@object-ui/core` (`utils/dom-props.ts`, #4431) so
 *     every plugin package can reach it.
 *   - a **deny-list** (`plugin-dashboard/src/schemaHostProps.ts`, #4357/PR
 *     #4428): destructure seven measured non-DOM props out, spread the rest.
 *
 * The deny-list is correct for the seven props it enumerates — this sweep
 * confirms all seven are gone from `metric` and `metric-card`. What it cannot
 * close is the **open tail**, exactly as `toDomProps`' docblock predicted: an
 * authored key the component does not declare still reaches the DOM. That is not
 * a hypothetical here; it is ledger rows {@link LEAK_LEDGER} `metric` and
 * `metric-card`, where `zzcanary` / `reference_to` / an authored
 * `props: { colorVariant }` all land as attributes while every one of the seven
 * named keys is correctly stripped. A deny-list bounded by enumeration cannot be
 * finished; a whitelist bounded by declaration can. That contrast IS the
 * measurement phase 2 waited for, and the ruling went to the whitelist on it.
 *
 * So the divergence is no longer a standing state of the repo — it is a
 * migration in progress, and the two rows still below are the last of it inside
 * these four packages. `plugin-dashboard` is now MIXED by design: its
 * `DashboardRenderer` grid container filters through `toDomProps` (#4432) while
 * the two KPI components still run the deny-list, and the two surviving rows are
 * precisely that difference, measured.
 *
 * ## objectui#5574 — the family this sweep could not see, and what it found
 *
 * Until objectui#5574 this gate's discovery was four namespace prefixes wide.
 * `packages/components/src/renderers/**` registered **158 types across five**
 * (`ui:`, `element:`, `page:`, `action:`, `protocol-placeholder:`) and not one
 * of them was reachable, so the whole family sat outside the ratchet. That is
 * not a theoretical hole: it is why `ui:grid`'s leak had to be found BY HAND
 * during objectui#4011 / PR #4785 rather than by this file.
 *
 * The widening was measured both ways before it was written, at one scope:
 *
 *   - PROBE — register one extra widget under `ui:`, a prefix this family owns,
 *     and run the gate as it stood: **green**. The completeness case never saw
 *     it.
 *   - CONTROL — the same perturbation, same assertion, one namespace over:
 *     register one extra widget under `plugin-dashboard:`, a prefix the gate
 *     DID cover: **red**, naming the unswept type. So the mechanism works and
 *     the four-prefix input was the whole of the gap.
 *
 * A control at some other scope would have proved nothing here — it could not
 * have failed. These two differ in exactly one thing: which namespace the extra
 * widget went into.
 *
 * ### The reading — 119 of 158 ON ARRIVAL, in seven shapes; 89 today
 *
 * The card named four candidates (`flex`, `stack`, `container`, `text`) and was
 * careful to call them candidates. All four leaked. So did 115 others, and the
 * measurement is in {@link COMPONENTS_LEAK_GROUPS}, grouped by the MECHANISM
 * that produces each shape rather than one hand-written sentence per renderer.
 * `ui:grid` read clean, which is objectui#4787 / PR #5573's fix now pinned by
 * a gate instead of by hand.
 *
 * Twenty-two rows have since been DELETED rather than edited. First `ui:flex`,
 * `ui:stack`, `ui:container` and `ui:text` (objectui#5574), then the eighteen
 * form controls that made up the whole `BARE_SPREAD_MINUS_NAME` shape
 * (objectui#5632) — which took a SHAPE off this list, not just rows, so the
 * grouping is six mechanisms now and not seven. All twenty-two measure clean,
 * so their rows had to go for the gate to pass — the two-way expiry below,
 * working exactly once it had something to expire. Later slices took more,
 * and objectui#5632's `ui:sidebar-trigger` took the last shape that named a
 * single renderer: **89 rows in FOUR shapes** remain, on a target set that has
 * itself grown to 159. What the arrival reading measured is preserved here in prose and in
 * the burn-down note on {@link COMPONENTS_LEAK_GROUPS}; what the gate asserts
 * is always current truth, which is the whole point of not writing dates into
 * a ledger.
 *
 * ⚠️ That reasoning is right about the ROWS and was wrong about the COUNTS: the
 * numbers quoted in this docblock were a SECOND, unasserted copy of the same
 * facts, and six of them had drifted by objectui#8659 — three correctly scoped
 * PRs each moved an array and left the prose behind. Section 6 closes it: every
 * count above is now read back out of this file's own text and checked against
 * the arrays. Adding a count to this docblock without adding it there puts the
 * next slice back where objectui#8659 found this one.
 *
 * ### Four phantom cleans, which are the finding behind the finding
 *
 * A first pass over this family reported 46 clean targets. Sixteen of those
 * were not clean — they had rendered NOTHING, or rendered an error boundary,
 * and an empty scan reports no leaks:
 *
 *   - 12 rendered no element at all: the overlays are closed until
 *     `defaultOpen`, `action:*` return `null` with no actions, and `ui:icon`
 *     returned `null` because the canary node's `name` is not a lucide icon.
 *
 *     ⚠️ `ui:icon` is the one of those twelve that has since been FIXED at the
 *     renderer rather than worked around here (objectui#5631). It used to need
 *     a forced `schemaExtras: { name: 'check' }` to render at all; it now
 *     renders a visible placeholder for an unresolvable glyph, so it is swept
 *     as an ordinary plain target on the node this file actually authors —
 *     identity `name: 'canary_node'` and nothing else. Its `BARE_SPREAD_ON_SVG`
 *     row was re-measured on that node as the ruling required and was
 *     UNCHANGED: the placeholder is the same bare spread onto the same SVG
 *     host, so it leaked the same fourteen. That the row did not move is the
 *     point — the reading no longer depended on a workaround that hid whether
 *     the renderer rendered. That row is now GONE, burned by objectui#5632
 *     (see the burn-down record below); this note is kept because the phantom
 *     it describes is a property of the SWEEP, not of the row.
 *   - 4 threw `useSidebar must be used within a SidebarProvider` and were
 *     caught by `SchemaErrorBoundary`, whose markup is attribute-clean.
 *
 * That is traps 1, 3 and 4 of the list below, at scale, and it is the reason
 * this family's readiness is an AUTHORED `className` ({@link COMPONENTS_READY})
 * rather than one transcribed selector per target: it proves the widget rendered its own
 * host element on every target, uniformly, and it caught all sixteen. The
 * targets it cannot cover carry their reason in
 * {@link READY_OVERRIDE_REASONS}, pinned two-way so that list cannot grow
 * quietly.
 *
 * Three of those six were swept in a PLACEHOLDER branch — `element:repeater`,
 * `element:definition-list` and `element:metadata_viewer` rendered an empty
 * state because the fixture never gave them enough to reach their real markup.
 * Their clean reading covered that branch only, and was recorded as such
 * rather than implied.
 *
 * ### objectui#5630 — deepening the three placeholder-branch fixtures
 *
 * Fixed by authoring real content for each, and — for the two that need it —
 * a per-target REACT HOST, the same technique `sidebar` above already uses:
 *
 *   - `element:definition-list` — pure schema. Authoring `items` is enough;
 *     no host needed.
 *   - `element:repeater` — needs `AdapterCtx` populated with a fixture whose
 *     `find()` returns a row. Measured first, and worth stating precisely
 *     because the issue that opened this card described the mechanism as
 *     "the sweep's `FAKE_ADAPTER` answers with no rows by design" — that undersold
 *     it: `useAdapter()` reads `AdapterCtx`, a context this suite never wires
 *     at all (it is normally populated by `app-shell`'s own `AdapterProvider`,
 *     which dials a real network client this suite has no business importing).
 *     So `element:repeater` was never actually reading `FAKE_ADAPTER`'s empty
 *     answer — the renderer's `useEffect` short-circuits on `!adapter` before
 *     ever calling `.find()`, on ANY fixture. Widening what `FAKE_ADAPTER`
 *     returns, the naive reading of the issue's own suggested shape, would
 *     have changed nothing; the fix is a new, additive `AdapterCtx.Provider`
 *     host (`REPEATER_FAKE_ADAPTER`), scoped to this one target only.
 *   - `element:metadata_viewer` — needs `MetadataCtx` populated with a
 *     resolvable `permission` fixture (`METADATA_HOST_CONTEXT`), the third
 *     data channel this family uses (`useMetadataItem()`), independent of
 *     both of the above.
 *
 * Two of the three dropped their `READY_OVERRIDE_REASONS` entry entirely:
 * `element:definition-list`'s `<dl>` and `element:repeater`'s `<ul>` both fold
 * `schema?.className` into their own `cn(...)` once they have real content, so
 * the shared readiness class reaches the DOM the same as any plain target and
 * the default {@link COMPONENTS_READY} selector matches. `element:metadata_viewer`
 * did NOT drop out — measured, not assumed, against an expectation at dispatch
 * time that it would: its `Shell` wrapper's className is hardcoded in every
 * branch (`ViewerProps` declares no `className` field), so no fixture depth
 * changes that. Its entry is rewritten to name the real render instead of the
 * not-found placeholder, not deleted. Net: `READY_OVERRIDE_REASONS` shrinks
 * from six entries to four — by TWO, not three.
 *
 * All three read CLEAN in the populated branch, same as they did in the
 * placeholder branch — but now as a measurement of markup that actually
 * exists, not as a report of nothing having rendered. Traced rather than
 * inferred: neither `basic/data-list.tsx` nor `basic/metadata-viewer.tsx`
 * spreads `{...props}` (or any rest of the React props `SchemaRenderer` hands
 * these components) onto a DOM element anywhere in either file — every host
 * element they render is hand-built from named fields only. So the canary
 * families this sweep plants have no path to the DOM in ANY branch of these
 * three renderers, regardless of fixture depth. The reverse-verification for
 * each target (a deliberately planted leak on the now-reachable populated-
 * branch element, confirmed to fail the gate, then reverted) is what turns
 * that trace into a measurement instead of a prediction; see the PR for the
 * transcript.
 *
 * ### Why the ledger, and why the renderer fixes are NOT in this change
 *
 * Widening the gate and fixing what it catches are separable, and folding 119
 * renderer fixes into the change that first measures them would destroy the
 * measurement: the ledger IS the record of what the tree looked like when the
 * gate arrived, and a PR that both widens and fixes leaves no reading anyone
 * can check the fixes against. `packages/components` is also the most-shared
 * package in the repo, so 119 renderer edits in one PR is the worst possible
 * shape for a merge queue several agents are landing into. The convergence runs
 * as per-package cards that each delete their own rows — the objectui#4425
 * phase-2 pattern this file already grades, now with rows to delete.
 *
 * ### Why a warning-as-error pin is not the answer here either
 *
 * objectui#4787 asked whether React's unknown-attribute warning could close
 * this class instead. PR #5573 answers that in full and the answer is no —
 * React does not warn for all-lowercase attributes at all, its suggested remedy
 * silences the warning while keeping the leak, Vitest discards console output
 * from passing tests, and the warning latches per prop name so a shared canary
 * consumes it. This family makes the point concrete: of the 14 attributes in
 * the commonest shape, the ones React would warn about are a minority, and the
 * SVG-hosted group objectui#5632 burned was one React reported differently
 * again — camelCase survives on an SVG host, so the spelling React sees and the
 * spelling that lands are the same and no warning distinguishes them. The
 * technique that closes the class reads the DOM, which is what this file does.
 *
 * ## Why this file lives in `packages/app-shell`
 *
 * The objectui#4409 dependency-direction method, applied to this sweep. A gate
 * that renders widgets from four plugin packages must live somewhere that may
 * legally import all four. Measured against the manifests on this tree:
 *
 *   - None of the four target packages can host it. `plugin-dashboard` declares
 *     only `plugin-charts` (a devDependency); no target package depends on
 *     `plugin-calendar` or `plugin-chatbot` at all. Hosting the sweep in any one
 *     of them would invert the dependency direction for the other three — the
 *     same inversion #4409 refused when it kept the map gate out of
 *     `@object-ui/i18n`.
 *   - Four workspace entries declare all four: `apps/console`, `apps/site`,
 *     `examples/console-starter` and `packages/app-shell`. The first three are
 *     applications and examples, not the natural home of a cross-package
 *     invariant.
 *   - `packages/app-shell` declares all four (`devDependencies`, which is the
 *     correct field for a test-only import and is what
 *     `scripts/check-phantom-dependencies.mjs` honours for a `__tests__/` file),
 *     and it declares `@object-ui/components` as a runtime `dependency` — so
 *     objectui#5574's widening needed no manifest change at all, and the
 *     direction argument holds a fortiori for it,
 *     and it is already the home of this repo's cross-package gates —
 *     `__tests__/spec-symbol-parity.test.ts` and #4409's own
 *     `__tests__/defaults-maps-mirror-en-pack.test.tsx`.
 *
 * So one suite covers all four packages and the "one suite per package" fallback
 * the card allowed for was not needed.
 *
 * ## Four traps that make a sweep like this pass while testing NOTHING
 *
 * Each was hit while building this file, and each is now an assertion rather
 * than a comment. This is the non-vacuity discipline: a target that does not
 * really render is a RED gate, never a quiet zero.
 *
 * 1. **A lazy boundary answers with a skeleton.** Every `plugin-charts` target
 *    renders through `React.lazy` inside `ChartRenderer`. The first measurement
 *    scanned the Suspense fallback (`class="animate-pulse …"`) and reported nine
 *    clean chart targets while the chart component had never mounted. Every
 *    target therefore has to reach a readiness selector proving its REAL markup
 *    exists before anything is scanned — for the charts that is the
 *    `[data-slot="chart"]` container the spread actually lands on. See the
 *    import block below for why the modules behind that boundary cannot simply
 *    be preloaded at module scope.
 * 2. **Portals are not in the render container.** `chatbot-floating` mounts
 *    through `ReactDOM.createPortal` into `#floating-chatbot-portal` on
 *    `document.body`, so an RTL `container`-scoped scan saw ZERO elements and
 *    reported it clean. This sweep scans `document.body`.
 * 3. **An error boundary looks like a render.** `SchemaErrorBoundary` catches a
 *    throwing widget and renders its own tidy alert markup, which has no leaked
 *    attributes at all. Three calendar targets "passed" that way. Every target
 *    now asserts the boundary is ABSENT before scanning.
 * 4. **A host-less render is a different component.** `object-calendar` throws
 *    `useSchemaContext must be used within a SchemaRendererProvider` on a bare
 *    `SchemaRenderer`, and an unconfigured one renders a "configuration
 *    required" placeholder instead of the calendar. Renders go through the
 *    provider, and each target carries the minimum schema its real markup needs.
 *
 * ## The judge is shared — it is no longer this file's to keep
 *
 * `isKnownAttribute` / `findLeaks` / `leakReport` used to be defined below, as
 * a copy of the judge in `packages/fields/src/__tests__/widget-dom-leak-e2e.test.tsx`.
 * That copy is gone: objectui#4434 extracted one judge into
 * `@object-ui/test-support` (private, never published — see its README for why
 * that home and not a subpath export), carrying the UNION of what the two
 * copies knew. The sweep-only half of that union is the ten recharts
 * marker/gradient/pattern attributes this file's SVG list had grown and the
 * fields copy never had; the calibration fixtures moved with the judge and now
 * exercise them.
 *
 * What did NOT move is everything below: the canary sets, the target
 * enumeration, the readiness selectors, {@link LEAK_LEDGER} and every
 * assertion. Only the judge unifies — a judge that starts carrying one gate's
 * policy is back to being two judges wearing one name.

 *   - A NUMERIC x. Scatter's category axis is a measure, so `name: 'Jan'` has
 *     no position and every row is unplaceable (`no-plottable-points`) — the
 *     other refusal, and the same blindness one step over.

 * Rows leave this ledger by being DELETED in the change that fixes them, never
 * by being edited into something looser. The record of what has left:
 *
 *   - objectui#5574 (this card's second pass) — `ui:flex`, `ui:stack`,
 *     `ui:container`, `ui:text`, all four from {@link BARE_SPREAD}. Converged on
 *     `toDomProps` the way `grid.tsx` was by objectui#4787 / PR #5573. The
 *     catalog-scale reading that drove it: 248 `flex`, 153 `stack`, 15
 *     `container` and 699 `text` nodes in `examples/schema-catalog` rendered
 *     through the real `SchemaRenderer` put 1194 illegitimate attributes on the
 *     DOM (`text[content]` 522, `flex[align]` 198, `flex[gap]` 193, `stack[gap]`
 *     153, `flex[justify]` 98, `container[padding]` 14, `container[maxwidth]` 6,
 *     `flex[direction]` 5, `stack[align]` 4, `text[value]` 1); the same probe
 *     reads 0 after, with `grid`'s 26 nodes at 0 both times as the control.
 *
 *   - objectui#5632 — the entire `BARE_SPREAD_MINUS_NAME` shape, all eighteen
 *     members: `action:button`, `action:icon`, `ui:button`, `ui:checkbox`,
 *     `ui:combobox`, `ui:date-picker`, `ui:email`, `ui:file-upload`, `ui:input`,
 *     `ui:input-otp`, `ui:password`, `ui:radio-group`, `ui:sidebar-menu-button`,
 *     `ui:slider`, `ui:sonner`, `ui:switch`, `ui:textarea`, `ui:toggle`. These
 *     render FORM CONTROLS, so the convergence is NOT the bare `toDomProps` the
 *     four above took — it is a form-control DECLARATION over the same
 *     mechanism (`packages/components/src/lib/form-control-dom-props.ts`),
 *     which forwards the `name` and `disabled` the SDUI baseline deliberately
 *     withholds. That distinction is invisible from inside this file, which is
 *     the point of writing it down here: `name` was never in these rows and
 *     `disabled` is not even a canary, so a convergence that dropped both would
 *     have turned this gate green while un-naming and re-enabling every control
 *     in the library. The catalog-scale reading: 287 form-control nodes in
 *     `examples/schema-catalog` put 284 illegitimate attributes on the DOM
 *     (`button[label]` 140, `button[icon]` 25, `input[inputtype]` 23,
 *     `input[label]` 19, `toggle[label]` 14, `radio-group[options]` 8,
 *     `date-picker[placeholder]` 7, `file-upload[label]` 7,
 *     `file-upload[buttontext]` 7, and a 34-attribute tail); the same probe
 *     reads 0 after, with `grid`'s 26 nodes at 0 both times as the control and
 *     an unchanged per-type node census across the two runs.
 *
 *   - objectui#5632 (the slice after that one) — the entire
 *     `BARE_SPREAD_ON_SVG` shape, both members: `ui:icon` and `ui:spinner`.
 *     Converged on the bare `toDomProps`, which is the answer the form-control
 *     group above could NOT take: `IconSchema` and `SpinnerSchema` declare only
 *     `icon` / `size` / `color`, and both renderers already consume all three by
 *     name, so nothing legitimate was withheld and no third declaration was
 *     warranted. The group is DELETED, which took the grouping from six
 *     mechanisms to five.
 *
 *     ⚠️ What this file could not have graded, recorded here because the next
 *     slice needs the warning: on an SVG host the judge counts `stroke`,
 *     `width`, `height`, `fill` and `color` as LEGITIMATE, so everything lucide
 *     emits sits in the half this gate never reports, in either direction. Two
 *     real behaviours lived in it. `ui:spinner` declares `size` as an ENUM and
 *     the spread handed the string to lucide's numeric `size` prop, so every
 *     sized spinner carried `width="lg" height="lg"`; and `ui:icon` declares
 *     `color` as a Tailwind CLASS, which the spread also fed to lucide's
 *     `color` prop, emitting `stroke="text-red-500"`. Both are gone, and
 *     neither moved a number here. They are measured and pinned in
 *     `examples/schema-catalog/test/svg-host-dom-leak-5632.test.tsx`, which
 *     asserts the LEGITIMATE attribute sets too — the guard this gate
 *     structurally cannot provide.
 *
 *   - objectui#5632 (the slice after that one) — `ui:sidebar-trigger`, the
 *     one-member group that leaked FOURTEEN where the rest of its shape leaks
 *     thirteen. The extra attribute was `schema` ITSELF, and it was there for a
 *     SECOND reason, not the group's: every other registration in
 *     `renderers/navigation/sidebar.tsx` destructures `schema` because it needs
 *     `schema.body`, while this one renders no children and named only
 *     `className` — so the node `SchemaRenderer` injects on every render simply
 *     rode the same spread. One filter closed both, and it is the FORM-CONTROL
 *     declaration rather than the bare `toDomProps`: the host is the `<button>`
 *     `SidebarTrigger` renders, where HTML defines `name`. The row's own
 *     thirteen-not-fourteen shape is the evidence — the judge counts the
 *     authored `name` LEGITIMATE here, so a bare `toDomProps` would have
 *     un-named this control without moving one number in this file.
 *
 *     ⚠️ Same warning as the SVG group above, in the other host's vocabulary:
 *     on a `<button>` the legitimate half this gate never reports is `name`,
 *     `id`, `class`, the resolved `aria-*`, `data-obj-*` and the primitive's own
 *     `data-sidebar="trigger"` — eight attributes, measured IDENTICAL before and
 *     after. That reading, plus the fact that the trigger still toggles and
 *     still carries its "Toggle Sidebar" accessible name, is pinned in
 *     `examples/schema-catalog/test/sidebar-trigger-dom-leak-5632.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## This is a ledger, not an allowlist — the difference, stated once
 *
 * An allowlist says "do not look here". Every row below says "we looked, this
 * is what we saw, and here is who owns it". Concretely, and this is the whole
 * distinction: a row cannot get looser on its own. If a listed renderer starts
 * leaking a NINTH attribute the gate fails, because the measured set no longer
 * equals the recorded one; if it stops leaking, the gate ALSO fails until the
 * row goes. An allowlist has neither property. Nothing below is skipped,
 * `it.skip`-ed, quarantined or excluded from the sweep — all 159 targets render
 * and all 159 are scanned on every run, the 70 clean ones included.
 */

 * simply not a leak.
 *
 * NO GROUP CARRIES THIS SHAPE ANY MORE — objectui#5632 burned all eighteen of
 * its members and DELETED the group, which is why what is left is a bare
 * attribute list. It survives as the base three other groups still derive from
 * (`action:menu` and `ui:form`), each of which measures this shape plus or

 *
 * The prediction this docblock carried before the burn-down — "converging these

 * around it" — is now measured, and it was only true because the convergence
 * was built to make it true. A bare `toDomProps` would have stripped `name`

/**
 * `plugin-calendar:calendar-view` used to be swept WITHOUT the `events` canary,
 * because authoring `events` — the ordinary SDUI action metadata of AGENTS.md
 * section 4, legal on any node — crashed the component outright: its renderer
 * computed a `CalendarEvent[]`, passed it as `events={…}`, then spread
 * `{...props}` AFTER it, so the authored object overwrote the array and
 * `CalendarView` threw `events is not iterable`. A crashing render produces
 * tidy, attribute-clean error-boundary DOM, so the canary had to be withheld or
 * the target would have read as a clean pass (trap 3).
 *
 * objectui#4433 fixed that — the renderer destructures the authored key out
 * before the spread — so BOTH halves came out in the same change: the
 * `omitCanaries` entry is gone (this target is swept with the full canary set
 * above, `events` included) and this case flipped from pinning the crash to
 * pinning the render.
 *
 * It is kept rather than deleted because it is the DIAGNOSIS the sweep case
 * cannot be: the sweep plants the whole canary set at once, so a regression
 * there says only "calendar-view broke". This one plants `events` alone, and
 * names the key.
 *
 * The `omitCanaries` facility itself stays. Nothing withholds a canary today,

 * 6. The docblock's counts are MEASURED, not remembered (objectui#8659)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

/**
 * The counts this file states in prose, asserted.
 *
 * ## What rotted, and why a text correction was not the fix
 *
 * Everything above reads its rows off the arrays, so the ROWS are always
 * current truth — that is the two-way expiry, and it works. The COUNTS were the
 * exception: a second, hand-written copy of the same facts, sitting in prose
 * that nothing read. objectui#8659 measured six of them wrong at once, produced
 * by three landed PRs (#7564, #7958, #8034 plus the `element:*` additions), each
 * correctly scoped to its own slice and each moving an array without moving the
 * paragraph that quotes it.
 *
 * ⛔ The realised harm is not "the docs are stale". This docblock is the FIRST
 * thing a burn-down slice reads, and a dispatch had already quoted `95 of 158`
 * out of it as a baseline — a slice that believed it would have reported
 * `95 -> 94` where the truth was `90 -> 89`. The PM loop ate a fabricated
 * number.
 *
 * objectui#5632's slice corrected all six texts once. That is precisely why
 * this section exists rather than a seventh correction: the next slice inherits
 * the same unasserted prose and it rots again. ⭐ The deliverable is the
 * MECHANISM — a moved array that leaves the paragraph behind must go RED.
 *
 * ## How the loop is closed, in two legs
 *
 * Neither leg alone closes it, and the reason is worth stating because the
 * obvious implementation stops after the first:
 *
 *  1. **{@link DOCBLOCK_COUNTS} vs {@link MEASURED_COUNTS}** — the named
 *     constants against the value re-derived from {@link COMPONENTS_PLAIN_TYPES},
 *     {@link COMPONENTS_SPECIAL_TARGETS} and {@link COMPONENTS_LEAK_GROUPS} on
 *     every run. One side is DERIVED; a constant compared against another
 *     constant asserts nothing.
 *  2. **The prose vs {@link DOCBLOCK_COUNTS}** — every sentence that quotes a
 *     number is read back out of this file's own source and checked. Without
 *     this leg the first one only MOVES the hand-written copy from the prose
 *     into a constant: a slice reddened by leg 1 repairs the constant, the
 *     paragraph stays wrong, and the defect is exactly where it was with one
 *     more place to forget.
 *
 * Together: move an array and leg 1 goes red; repair only the constant and
 * leg 2 goes red; the paragraph has to move.
 *
 * ## The rule for a number added to this file later
 *
 * ⚠️ Every count here is one of two things, and the difference is the whole
 * discipline:
 *
 *   - a LIVE reading of the tree as it stands — it belongs in
 *     {@link DOCBLOCK_COUNTS} with a statement in {@link QUOTED_COUNTS}, or it
 *     is the next drift;
 *   - an ARRIVAL reading, kept deliberately because the burn-down is the story
 *     (`119 of 158 ON ARRIVAL`, the phantom-clean census, the per-PR rows of the
 *     burn-down list) — it must SAY it is historical, in the sentence itself.
 *     A live-sounding tense on a frozen number is how `158` got quoted as
 *     today's target count.
 *
 * A number that is incidental rather than a reading — "one selector per target"
 * — is best written without a literal at all.
 *
 * ⭐ The shape generalises past this file, and objectui#8659's triage asked for
 * the observation rather than a tenth hand-written card: this is the first
 * enforced instance of a class that has been repaired BY HAND at least six
 * times in this repo (objectui#7448, #8122, #8484, #8629, #9004, and this one),
 * across workflow headers, gate `.mjs` docblocks and docs pages. What makes it
 * mechanisable here is that the file holding the prose also holds the arrays,
 * so no cross-file rooting is needed. Where that is true elsewhere, this is the
 * technique; where it is not, the pin needs a path and the path needs a root
 * (`scripts/check-test-path-roots.mjs`).
