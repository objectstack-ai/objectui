 * objectui#5216 — the private `?runAction=` string convention is RETIRED, and
 * cannot come back by accident.
 *
 * ## What the convention was
 *
 * `?runAction=<name>` was a deep link with **two hand-written definitions and
 * no declaration**: `CloudOnboardingNext` built the query by string
 * concatenation (`` `${envsRoute}?runAction=create_environment` ``), and
 * `EnvironmentListToolbar` matched it by reading a bare `'runAction'` literal
 * off `window.location.search` and comparing it to a hard-coded action name.
 *
 * Nothing declared it. `objectui validate` could not see it (the nav schema
 * strips unknown keys). `RESERVED_URL_PARAMS` did not list it, so a page could
 * have repurposed the name with no collision check to catch it. And because the
 * consumer compared against ONE hard-coded action, the "convention" was really
 * a single-value private protocol between two files — a second de-facto
 * contract of exactly the shape AGENTS.md #0.1 exists to prevent.
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` now publishes the real one: `ObjectNavItemSchema.runAction`
 * (objectstack#7253). So the convention is not a contract that needs migrating;
 * it is pure debt, and this file is what keeps it deleted.
 *
 * ## ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT ASSERT — read before adding a case here
 *
 * This is a SOURCE SCAN, not a behavioural test. It proves the literal is gone
 * from the source, not that the runtime honours the declared slot — that is
 * `resolveHref.runAction.test.ts` (producer) and `useNavRunAction.test.tsx`
 * (consumer), and neither is replaceable by this one. A scan also cannot see a
 * literal assembled at runtime (`'run' + 'Action'`); it catches the failure
 * mode that actually recurs — someone re-typing the string because importing
 * the constant was one keystroke more.
