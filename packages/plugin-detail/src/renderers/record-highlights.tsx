   *
   * `requiredPermissions` on a record block is a **system capability set** —
   * the one meaning the word carries on `action`, `app`, `field` and
   * `bulkAction` — so it is read through the permission context's capability
   * path (`hasCapabilities` over the reported `systemPermissions`). An unheld
   * or unrecognised capability hides the whole strip.
   *
   * ⛔ NOT `perms.can(objectName, name)`. That call's second argument is the
   * closed object-action enum, and the stock `/me/permissions` provider maps
   * only eight verbs (`read`, `view`, `create`, `update`, `edit`, `delete`,
   * `import`, `export`) before its `?? 'allowRead'` tail sends everything else
   * to the object's read bit — so a capability nobody holds passed for every
   * reader of the object, with no refusal, no warning and no log. The full
   * reproduction behind that sentence is written once, at the same gate in
   * `record-quick-actions.tsx`, and is not restated here.
   *
   * ⛔ The object name is deliberately ABSENT from the verdict. A system
   * capability is not object-scoped, and the old `&& objectName` conjunct was
   * a second silent fail-open: a block rendered with no `objectName` in its
   * record context skipped its declared gate entirely.   *
   * ⚠️ A provider that never REPORTS capabilities (`systemPermissions`
   * `undefined` — the role-based `PermissionProvider`, a backend predating
   * ADR-0066, or no provider at all) still opens this gate. That is
   * `hasCapabilities`'s own ruled unreported-vs-empty doctrine
   * (objectui#4656), shared with every other capability gate in the tree; a
   * REPORTED empty array (`[]`, "holds nothing") is a real answer and gates
   * strictly.
