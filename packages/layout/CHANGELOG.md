### Minor Changes

- 969ba84: Renderers for the `app:launcher` and `nav:menu` page blocks (objectui#6661).
  Phase 1 of the 2026-08-26 maintainer ruling on objectstack#12183 — the two
  `PageComponentType` members that are purely metadata-driven, so nothing had to
  ship before their renderers could. Phase 2 (`global:search` /
  `global:notifications`) landed in objectui#6757 and set the pattern this
  follows.
  
  A page that declared either member drew a dashed box. The two symptoms were not
  the same, which is worth recording because it decides what "fixed" looks like
  for each:
  
  - `nav:menu` is in `PALETTE_PLACEHOLDER_BLOCKS`, registered eagerly, so it drew
    the literal "Component Placeholder" scaffold in every host.
  - `app:launcher` is only in `PROTOCOL_COMPONENTS`, registered when a host opts
    in via `registerPlaceholders()` — which just `apps/console` does. So it drew
    the scaffold in the console and `SchemaRenderer`'s red OBJUI-001 "Unknown
    component type" panel everywhere else.
  
  Neither block adds a data layer — each mounts plumbing that was already live,
  and neither issues a request or touches an adapter:
  
  - `app:launcher` reads the metadata app registry (`useMetadata().apps`, which
    `MetadataProvider` fetches eagerly) through the shared `filterActiveApps`
    predicate, and draws it with `HomeAppsStrip` — the console's own launcher
    grid — so an authored launcher and the Home launcher cannot drift into two
    looks for one thing.
  - `nav:menu` reads the active app's navigation tree from that same registry and
    renders it as page content, taking every derived fact from `@object-ui/layout`:
    hrefs from `resolveHref`, labels from `resolveNavItemLabel`, the active row
    from `resolveActiveNavItem`, and the item-level guards (`visible`,
    `requiredPermissions`, `requiresObject` / `requiresService`) in the order
    `NavigationItemRenderer` applies them, wired to the same console providers
    `AppSidebar` wires them to. `action` items dispatch through
    `useNavActionDispatch`, so framework#4509's "renders but dead-clicks" shape is
    not reintroduced.
  
  `nav:menu` does not mount `NavigationRenderer` itself: that renders through
  `SidebarMenuButton`, whose `useSidebar()` throws outside the shell's
  `SidebarProvider`, and a page block has to render standalone. `@object-ui/layout`
  therefore exports `resolveNavItemLabel`, which was module-private — an additive
  export with no behaviour change, so the sidebar and an authored menu cannot show
  one nav entry under two names.
  
  Both registrations publish **no** `inputs`: `ComponentPropsMap` declares an empty
  shape for each, and both use `skipFallback: true` so neither claims the bare
  `launcher` / `menu` keys. This does not change the Studio page palette —
  `app:launcher` remains recorded there as a shell singleton, which is a palette
  decision independent of whether a declared type renders.
  
  Three new strings — the launcher's and the menu's accessible names, and the
  menu's empty state — are declared under `console.nav` in `en.ts` and its nine
  sibling packs. An inline `defaultValue` alone is not a fix: it renders English
  at one call site and leaves the string untranslatable everywhere
  (objectui#3517).
- e62c44e: Re-home the breakpoint layout vocabulary and delete the two dead responsive
  implementations (objectui#7580, maintainer ruling 2026-09-04, option A).
  
  **Breaking, deliberately, in one direction only.** `@objectstack/spec` retired its whole
  `ui/responsive` vocabulary in objectstack#11027 — `ResponsiveConfigSchema`,
  `BreakpointName`, `BreakpointColumnMapSchema` and `BreakpointOrderMapSchema` — on the
  stated ground that the four types "had no other authorable carrier". That ground is
  measurably false on the renderer side: `responsive-grid` is a REGISTERED SDUI component
  whose authorable `columns` input is typed by `BreakpointColumnMap` and applied by
  `resolveColumnClasses` on the render path, and `BreakpointName` types four live readers in
  `@object-ui/mobile`. The tombstone's own return condition — the vocabulary "returns if and
  when a renderer implements it" — is already met here, so the two types a renderer reads
  are re-homed rather than retired.
  
  What survives, under the same names and the same members:
  
  - `BreakpointName` (`xs`…`2xl`) is now declared in `@object-ui/types` (`mobile.ts`) instead
    of re-exported from the spec. **No consumer change**: same name, same six members, same
    export sites on `@object-ui/types` and `@object-ui/mobile`. Only its provenance moved.
  - `BreakpointColumnMap` is now declared in `@object-ui/layout` (`ResponsiveGrid.tsx`),
    verbatim from the retired `$strict` schema: six optional column counts, no index
    signature. `responsive-grid`'s `columns` input and its resolver are unchanged.
  
  What is removed:
  
  - `BreakpointOrderMap` (`@object-ui/layout`) — retired with the key, not re-homed. It had
    no read point in the package; it was published only because the retired
    `ResponsiveConfigSchema` paired it with the column map, so an author configuring `order`
    needed the type. With the schema gone there is no order vocabulary for it to be the type
    of, and re-declaring it would be the declare-without-enforce shape ADR-0049 removes.
  - `useResponsiveConfig` (`@object-ui/mobile`), with its `SpecResponsiveConfig` and
    `ResolvedResponsiveState` exports, and `ResponsiveProtocol` (`@object-ui/core`), with
    `resolveResponsiveConfig` / `getVisibilityClasses` / `getColumnClasses` /
    `getOrderClasses` / `shouldHideAtBreakpoint`. Both read the retired
    `ResponsiveConfigSchema` and both were measured at zero callers (objectui#4773).
  - `SpecResponsiveConfig` / `SpecBreakpointName` (`@object-ui/types`) — dead re-exports once
    the two implementations above went, dropped rather than re-declared locally, the same
    disposition the retired i18n names in that file already carry.
  
  No behaviour is retired. The live per-breakpoint readers — `useBreakpoint`,
  `ResponsiveContainer`, `BREAKPOINTS` / `BREAKPOINT_ORDER` / `getCurrentBreakpoint`, and
  `responsive-grid` itself — are untouched.
  
  **Sequencing.** objectui's next `@objectstack/spec` pin bump must carry `Blocked-by:`
  objectui#7580: the retirement is merged upstream and unreleased, so this must land first.

### Patch Changes

- c6198c2: **Breaking for authored metadata:** `ComponentInput.label`, `ComponentInput.defaultValue` and
  `ComponentInput.advanced` are RETIRED on both faces (objectui#7493 item ① and objectui#7781;
  maintainer ruling A of 2026-09-06, immediate, no deprecation window; ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).
  They are the three keys the manifest serializer does not forward, and nothing read them on any
  publication or consumption path.
  
  No manifest ever published them, so no consumer could ever have read them. `sdui-parser`'s
  serializer (`packages/sdui-parser/src/index.ts`) forwards exactly six keys per input — `name`,
  `type`, `required`, `enum`, `binding`, `description` — so a value authored under any of the three
  never reached `sdui.manifest.json`, the generated JSX `.d.ts`, or a diagnostic; its boundary type
  has no slot for them; the registry's data-source seam reads `name` only; and neither the designer
  nor the app-shell inspectors consult registry `inputs` at all. A structural census over every
  `inputs:` array in the repository (re-measured on this change's merge-base, `name` 951 and `type`
  951 as the controls) counted the writes: `label` 908, `defaultValue` 245, `advanced` 9 — written on
  nearly every registration, read by nothing.
  
  FROM → TO, per key — all three **TOMBSTONED, not removed**, because the route was measured on
  the built face before it was chosen: `ComponentInputSchema` is a non-strict `z.object`, and an
  undeclared key parses GREEN and is silently STRIPPED, so a deletion would have swallowed 1,162
  authored values in silence. The tombstone is what makes the refusal loud and by name.
  
  - `label?: string` → `label?: never` on the interface, `retirementTombstone()` on the Zod mirror.
    Migration: delete the key. An input is identified by its `name` on every path that reaches it;
    nothing ever rendered a label for it.
  - `defaultValue?: any` → `defaultValue?: never` / `retirementTombstone()`. Migration: delete the
    key. The renderer's own fallback read IS the default; tell the author about it in `description`,
    which IS published. (Tightening the type to `unknown` was ruled out: it closes no error class,
    since nothing reads the value.)
  - `advanced?: boolean` → `advanced?: never` / `retirementTombstone()`. Migration: delete the key.
    No designer surface ever hid an "advanced" input; there is nothing to write instead.
  
  The retirement kit: `?: never` on `ComponentInput` (`packages/types/src/base.ts`), so authoring one
  is a `tsc` error at the registration site; `retirementTombstone()` on `ComponentInputSchema`
  (`packages/types/src/zod/base.zod.ts`), so an authored value is REFUSED at parse time with
  `code: 'invalid_type'`, the key named in the issue `path`, and the migration note as the message
  (one string, both channels). Pinned in
  `packages/types/src/__tests__/component-input-retired-keys-7493.test.ts`, which also holds a
  tree-scoped absence census over every `inputs:` array under `packages/**` and `apps/**`.
  
  Accept-set change, stated plainly for reviewers: a document that sets any of the three keys on a
  `ComponentInput` used to parse GREEN (the value was then dropped by the serializer) and now parses
  RED. Every in-repo authoring site — 1,199 keys across 110 registration files, the three standalone
  `ComponentInput[]` arrays and the two named input arrays `tsc` found included — is deleted in the same change, as the ruling's split rule
  requires; the `WidgetRegistry` seam no longer copies the widget-manifest values onto the synthesized
  `ComponentInput` (they fed nothing), and the data-source declaration `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT`
  drops its `label`. The patch entries on the other packages record exactly that: their registrations
  stop authoring inert keys, with no runtime or published-manifest change.
  
  The nine test files that read `defaultValue` off a registration were re-pinned against the
  renderer's ACTUAL default (its own fallback read, or the `defaultProps` it ships) instead of the
  declaration that went away; two assertions that only restated the shadow default were dropped with
  the reason on the line.
  
  The in-repo zero is what was measured. Whether anything OUTSIDE this repository writes these keys
  is not measurable from here (the objectui#5674 limit); converting such a write from a silent drop
  into a named refusal is exactly what the tombstones buy. `WidgetInput`'s own `label` /
  `defaultValue` / `advanced` (the widget-manifest face) stay declared and writable — nothing has
  ruled on that face; that it now has no reader either is recorded as objectui#7911.
- fe76ece: The typings both packages publish now carry an explicit extension on every relative specifier, so a consumer on `moduleResolution: nodenext` can follow them.
  
  `vite-plugin-dts` emits one declaration file per source file, and TypeScript
  copies a module specifier into the declaration verbatim. `export * from './ui'`
  therefore shipped extensionless in `dist/index.d.ts` — 21 such re-exports in
  `@object-ui/components`, 7 in `@object-ui/layout`, 128 across the two emitted
  trees. Node16/NodeNext resolution does not extension-search a relative
  specifier, so the compiler could follow none of the hops and every symbol they
  carried read as absent from the package:
  
  ```
  error TS2305: Module '"@object-ui/components"' has no exported member 'Badge'.
  ```
  
  Measured on `@object-ui/app-shell`, the largest consumer and the one that pulls
  in both packages: 880 TS2305 across 162 files (864 from `components`, 16 from
  `layout`), plus 215 TS7006 as fallout from the imports that stopped resolving.
  On `@object-ui/fields`, 178 TS2305 and 57 TS7006. Both are zero now.
  
  The emitted `.js` never had the defect — rolldown resolves the same specifier
  away — which is why `pnpm check:esm-specifiers`, whose verdict is about
  specifier-preserving `.js` builds, correctly never scanned either package. The
  fix is therefore in the declaration EMIT (`scripts/vite-dts-explicit-extensions.ts`,
  shared by both `vite.config.ts` files), not in the sources: the same source line
  produces a clean `.js` and a broken `.d.ts`, so no source edit can express the
  difference. The rewriter resolves each specifier against the source tree the
  output mirrors — a file hop becomes `./x.js`, a directory hop `./x/index.js` —
  throws on anything it cannot resolve, and after the build re-parses the emitted
  declarations to assert every relative specifier both carries an extension and
  names a file the build really emitted.
  
  `packages/fields` takes the `nodenext` pin as a result — the same two lines
  `packages/react` has carried since objectui#4538 — so the property is enforced by
  the compiler on the consumer side rather than by review. `packages/app-shell`
  does not: it type-checks clean without the pin and still shows 23 errors with it,
  none of them from these two packages. That residue is filed separately.

## 17.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 88085e3: Consume the declared nav `runAction` slot; retire the private `?runAction=` string convention
  
  An `object` navigation item can now declare `runAction: '<actionName>'` and the shell will run that action once on arrival at the object's list surface, through the ordinary execute path — so param dialogs, confirms and entitlement gates all still apply. The slot is `@objectstack/spec`'s `ObjectNavItemSchema.runAction`; objectui now reads it instead of a private convention.
  
  - `NavigationItem` declares `runAction` (derived from the spec's object-nav variant), and objectui's own nav schema stops stripping it — `objectui validate` previously discarded the key, so an entry carrying a deep link validated clean with the deep link thrown away.
  - `resolveHref` encodes it onto the list href as the reserved `?runAction=` param, on the list landings only. A `recordId` entry resolves to a record page, which has no list toolbar to answer it, so the slot is not encoded there.
  - The deep link is honoured on **every** object list, not just the environments list. The action is armed only when it is actually present at `list_toolbar`; a name no action answers to runs nothing and deliberately leaves the URL untouched, so a later mount with fresher metadata can still honour it. Undefined references are rejected upstream at authoring time by `defineStack`.
  - The param name now has exactly one definition (`NAV_RUN_ACTION_PARAM`, exported from `@object-ui/layout`) and is registered in the console's reserved-param collision check. It was previously a bare literal hand-written at both the producing and consuming ends, declared by no schema and listed in no registry.
  - `CloudOnboardingNext` takes an optional `properties.createAction` (defaulting to `create_environment`) instead of hand-concatenating its deep link.
- 86f633f: Remove the published optional key `logo` from `AppShellBranding` (`@object-ui/layout`).
  
  The key was declared but never read. `useAppShellBranding` applies only
  `primaryColor`, `accentColor`, `favicon` and `title`, and `AppShell` installs no
  context provider at all — so its doc comment, "Logo URL — passed to sidebar/navbar
  via context", described a mechanism that did not exist. Three call sites were
  feeding the key a real value that was silently discarded, and all three are removed
  with it: `AppSchemaRenderer`, `ConsoleLayout` and the console's `useBranding` hook.
  
  The real logo entry point is unchanged and is where it always was: the app schema's
  own `branding.logo`, read directly by `AppSidebar` in `@object-ui/app-shell`, plus
  the app schema's top-level `logo`, rendered directly by `AppSchemaRenderer`'s
  default sidebar header. Neither path went through `AppShellBranding`, so nothing
  rendering-visible changes.
  
  Migration: a consumer that passes `logo` inside an `AppShellBranding` object literal
  now gets a compile error. Delete the key — it never reached a renderer. To show a
  logo, set it on the app schema's `branding.logo` instead.
- 29167d5: **Breaking (shipped as `minor`, following the `page-header` `description` retirement):**
  `app-shell` is no longer a component key. `registerLayout()` registered `AppShell` under
  that key with no `inputs`; the registration is gone (objectui#4841, ADR-0049
  enforce-or-remove, remove side, maintainer ruling 2026-08-16).
  
  **What it could never do.** Four of `AppShellProps`' seven keys are `React.ReactNode`
  slots — `sidebar`, `navbar`, `children`, `rightRail` — and a JSON document can fill none
  of them, so `{ "type": "app-shell" }` resolved to a component that had exactly two
  outcomes, neither of them a shell. `children` was dropped in silence: `SchemaRenderer`
  strips `children` (and `body`) before spreading a node's keys as props, and `AppShell`
  reads its `children` prop, never `schema.children`, so the `<main>` element rendered
  empty with nothing logged. A schema written into `sidebar` / `navbar` / `rightRail`
  arrived as a plain object React refuses to render, replacing the node with an error box.
  Only `className`, `defaultOpen` and `branding` ever survived the JSON path, i.e. the best
  result JSON could reach was a shell with no navigation, no top bar and an empty content
  area. With no `inputs` declared, `sdui-parser` had no declaration face to compare a node
  against either, so neither outcome was diagnosed.
  
  **What changes for an author.** The middle state — parses, resolves, renders nothing — is
  replaced by a named refusal. `SchemaRenderer` now shows its `Unknown component type:
  app-shell` panel (`OBJUI-001`) and `sdui-parser` reports an `error`-severity
  `unknown-component` diagnostic before render.
  
  **FROM → TO.** There is no in-place rewrite, because the node never produced a shell.
  Schema authors who want the whole shell from metadata use `app-schema-renderer`
  (`AppSchemaRenderer`), which declares its `inputs` and builds branding and sidebar
  navigation from an `AppSchema` document: `{ "type": "app-shell", … }` →
  `{ "type": "app-schema-renderer", "schema": { … } }`. Everyone else composes in React —
  `AppShell` is **unchanged and still exported** from `@object-ui/layout`, and remains the
  way to build a shell and render JSON pages inside it.
  
  Repo-wide scan before removal found no `"type": "app-shell"` node anywhere in
  `objectstack-ai/objectui` or `objectstack-ai/objectstack` at `origin/main` — no example,
  catalog schema, fixture or template authored one. `content/docs/guide/layout.md` is
  updated to state the new fact, and
  `packages/layout/src/__tests__/app-shell-not-a-component-key.test.tsx` pins it on both
  faces (source and live registry) plus the rendered diagnostic.
- 45f7dcc: **Breaking (shipped as `minor`, following the `app-shell` component-key deregistration):**
  `app-schema-renderer`'s `mobileNavMode` is now declared as the vocabulary the renderer
  implements — `enum: ['drawer', 'bottom_nav']` — instead of free-text `string`, and the
  third member of `MobileNavMode` is retired (objectui#3985, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove,
  maintainer ruling 2026-08-10).
  
  **What used to happen.** The registration declared `{ name: 'mobileNavMode', type:
  'string' }`, so `sdui-parser`'s `checkType` asked only whether the value was a string.
  `mobileNavMode="bottom-nav"` — the hyphenated spelling of the underscored value, and the
  likeliest typo on this key — passed the manifest gate, passed the parser, reached the
  renderer, missed its one equality test, and rendered the drawer. Nothing reported
  anything, at any layer. The declaration was WIDER than the implementation, which is why
  the `invalid-enum` that should have fired never could.
  
  **What happens now.** A value outside the vocabulary is an **error**-level `invalid-enum`
  from `validateTree` / `compile`, so a schema-driven author — very often an AI author — is
  stopped at the typo instead of debugging a mode that silently did nothing. The generated
  `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts` narrows from `mobileNavMode?: string` to the two-value union for
  the same reason.
  
  **Retirement.** `MobileNavMode` had a third member documented as "collapsed sidebar" with
  **zero read points** in `AppSchemaRenderer`: the only two reads are the `drawer` default
  and the `=== 'bottom_nav'` comparison that gates the bottom bar, so the value was
  behaviourally identical to the default while the union, the JSDoc and `ROADMAP.md`
  presented it as a capability. It is gone from the union and from the published
  vocabulary. Making it real behaviour is an implementation card first — the value comes
  back together with a renderer read point, never as a declaration on its own.
  
  **Migration.** Both implemented modes are unchanged; no runtime behaviour moves. A
  TypeScript caller passing the retired literal now fails to compile (it previously
  compiled and rendered the drawer), and a JSON/JSX author writing it — or any other
  out-of-vocabulary value — now gets a validation error where they previously got silence.
  In both cases the value that reproduces the old behaviour exactly is `drawer`.
- f923b7c: **Breaking (shipped as `minor`, see below):** `@object-ui/layout`'s `<PageHeader>` retires the legacy `description` prop. `subtitle` is now the only spelling for the secondary line.
  
  `PageHeader` read `subtitle ?? description`. The alias was not tolerance for a sloppy author — it was the only thing standing between an externally authored `description` and a page that renders its title and silently drops its second line, which is why objectui#3226 refused to delete it: "no in-repo author writes `description`" (true, verified) says nothing about the stored metadata of out-of-repo consumers.
  
  **FROM → TO.** JSX call sites: `<PageHeader title="X" description="Y" />` → `<PageHeader title="X" subtitle="Y" />`. Schema authors: `{ "type": "page-header", "description": "Y" }` → `{ "type": "page-header", "subtitle": "Y" }`. Stored stack metadata needs no hand edit — `os migrate meta` rewrites it, and a protocol 17 loader rewrites it on the way in.
  
  **Why the read could go now.** The normalization moved upstream, where a contract belongs: protocol 17's ADR-0087 D2 conversion `page-header-subtitle-alias` rewrites a header node's `properties.description` to `properties.subtitle` as the stack loads. The gate on this side was a measurement, not a date — every position a `page-header` node can occupy had to be shown to pass through that rewrite. It did not, at first: measured 2026-08-08 against `@objectstack/spec@17.0.0-rc.5`, the conversion walk reached `pages[].regions[].components[]` and stopped, leaving seven spec-valid header positions unconverted — including `slots.header` on a `kind: 'slotted'` record page, the shape this repo's own slotted-pages guide prescribes (objectstack#6775). With the walk widened by objectstack#6776 (slots) and objectstack PR #7034 (containers nested to any depth: `properties.children`, `items[].children`, `body`, `footer`), all seven convert. Re-measured against `@objectstack/spec@17.0.0-rc.6`, which this package depends on, before the read was deleted.
  
  The measurement is now a standing pin rather than a one-off: `packages/layout/src/__tests__/page-header-subtitle-conversion-coverage.test.ts` re-runs all seven positions against the resolved spec build on every test run. If a future spec narrows that reach — or a dependency is pinned back below `17.0.0-rc.6` — it fails there, at the seam, instead of turning into a second line that quietly stops rendering in a consumer's app. The two tests in `page-header-authorable-keys.test.tsx` that pinned the fallback's continued existence were deleted in this same change, as their own SEQUENCING note instructed, and replaced with the opposite assertion: a lone `description` now renders no secondary line.
  
  **Not affected, despite the shared word:** the `page` renderer's own `description` prop (the page's prose under the page title) is a live declared key of a different node, untouched here. `@object-ui/app-shell`'s separate `<PageHeader>` uses `description` as its only secondary-line prop and is likewise unchanged.
  
  `minor` rather than `major` is deliberate and follows the repo's retirement precedent (PR #3793): all 39 publishable packages sit in one `fixed` group, so a `major` here would carry the whole family to 18.0.0 against an `@objectstack` still on 17 and break the "same major ⇒ compatible" pin between the two repos (AGENTS.md §版本号策略, enforced by `scripts/check-changeset-no-major.mjs`). objectui's own breaking changes ship as `minor` with the break spelled out in the body — which is what the FROM → TO above is.
- 9c60144: **Breaking (published API):** `NavigationRenderer` no longer accepts `resolveGroupLabel` or `resolveItemLabel`. If your build just broke on one of these props, delete the prop — it never did anything.
  
  Both were id-keyed label resolvers on `NavigationRendererProps` (`@object-ui/layout`), typically wired to `useObjectLabel().navGroupLabel` from `@object-ui/i18n` to translate sidebar group and leaf labels from a client translation pack keyed `{ns}.apps.{appName}.navigation.{nodeId}.label`.
  
  **They could never fire.** The renderer guards convention-based resolution with `isCustomized` — a case-insensitive "the authored label differs from this branch's comparison target" test. On the `object` / `dashboard` branches the target is the object or dashboard name, and the test is meaningful: it protects an author's custom label (`Projects`) from being overwritten by an `objects.project.label` translation. On the two id-keyed branches the target was the nav node's own **`id`** — `grp_workspace`, `group_sales` — while the label was its text — `Workspace`, `Sales`. Those never compare equal, so the guard was true for every real navigation entry and the resolver beneath it was unreachable. The only node that could have reached it is one whose label is literally its own id.
  
  Nothing regresses when they go, because nothing was using them to begin with: **app-navigation localization is owned solely by the server-side `/meta` boundary.** `translateApp` (`@objectstack/spec`, `src/system/i18n-resolver.ts`) rewrites every navigation node's `label` by id, and `@objectstack/rest` applies it before the metadata reaches the client — so nav labels arrive already localized and the client-side path was never the one answering. One owner, not two.
  
  **If you wired these hooks to localize navigation, your labels were never being localized by them.** Move the translation to the server side: add it to the app's i18n bundle that `translateApp` reads, keyed by navigation node id. A client-side pack keyed `apps.*.navigation.*.label` changes nothing in the sidebar.
  
  Also in this change:
  
  - `useObjectLabel().navGroupLabel` (`@object-ui/i18n`) is **kept**, but its docstring no longer promises `"Sales" → "销售"` for sidebar groups — that promise was false, and a live docstring describing an unreachable path is how an agent or a developer ends up wiring a translation pack and receiving silent non-localization. It is now documented for what it is: a plain reader for `{ns}.apps.{appName}.navigation.{groupId}.label` with no first-party caller, pointing at the server boundary for anything nav-related.
  - `UnifiedSidebar` (`@object-ui/app-shell`) drops the two prop wirings, including a `studio` carve-out that existed only to stop `resolveItemLabel` from re-translating an already-translated "Package management" label.
  - The `object` / `dashboard` / `viewName` branches — `resolveObjectLabel`, `resolveDashboardLabel`, `resolveViewLabel` — are untouched and keep both their resolvers and the `isCustomized` guard.

### Patch Changes

- d442795: AppShell: drop the unused `Sidebar` import. `AppShell` renders the node the caller passes
  in the `sidebar` prop and never constructs a `Sidebar` itself, so the import was dead
  (tree-shaken out of every bundle) and only suggested otherwise to readers. No runtime
  behaviour changes.
- 8a9dece: `SidebarNav`'s README example teaches the shape the component actually reads.
  
  `packages/layout/README.md` — the package's npm landing page, shipped in `files` —
  spelled every nav item `{ label, path, icon: 'home' }`. `NavItem` declares none of
  those three keys: the label is `title`, the target is `href`, and `icon` is a
  `React.ComponentType` rendered as `<item.icon />`, not an icon name. Copied
  verbatim the example produced a sidebar whose every row was unlabelled
  (`<span>{item.title}</span>` reading `undefined`), a `NavLink` with
  `to={undefined}`, and the string `'home'` handed to React as an unknown lowercase
  tag. Both README examples now use `title` / `href` / imported Lucide components,
  and annotate the array as `NavItem[]` so the same class of typo becomes a compile
  error where it is written instead of a blank sidebar at runtime.
  
  Adds the props tables the README never carried — `SidebarNavProps`, `NavItem`
  (`badge`, `badgeVariant` and `children` included) and `NavGroup`, plus a grouped
  and nested example — and pins all of it rather than leaving a second surface free
  to rot the same way: the examples are real, type-checked code in
  `readme-sidebar-nav-example.test.ts` asserted to appear verbatim in the README, and
  the tables are compared against the interface keys read out of `SidebarNav.tsx` on
  every run. Also corrects a comment in `side-effects-manifest.test.ts` that named
  `SidebarNav` as the component behind the `navigation-renderer` registration; that
  key belongs to a different component, and `SidebarNav` is registered under no key
  at all.
  
  No runtime change — `SidebarNav.tsx` is untouched. This is `patch` rather than a
  no-release declaration because the corrected landing page only reaches npm through
  a publish.
- 183d09b: Studio 页面设计器不再为 canonical `page:header` 提供 `icon` 编辑框(objectui#3829)
  
  `PageHeaderProps.icon` 已在 `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0 随 ADR-0087 D2 退役
  (objectstack#6946 / PR objectstack#7115):canonical `page:header` 渲染器从未读过它,
  表头的身份由 record chrome(`recordChrome`)与每个 action 自带的 `icon` 承担。退役前
  作者填入的值被静默丢弃,退役后平台按名拒绝整个节点 —— 而设计器仍在提供那个输入框,
  等于教作者写出解析失败的元数据。本次移除该字段与它此时已成孤儿的两条 i18n 键
  (en / zh 同一次改动,两张表的键集保持一致),并把「不得回潮」钉在
  `previews/__tests__/block-config.test.ts`。
  
  `@object-ui/layout` 的 `page-header` / `layout:page-header` 别名**保留** `icon` 输入,
  行为不变:那是另一个渲染器,它真读真画(`PageHeader.tsx`),文档与本仓唯一的活 demo
  都写它。变的只是这条声明的**依据** —— 从 spec parity 改述为 renderer-read 事实,并让
  `page-header-authorable-keys` 守卫在派生 spec 键集时跳过墓碑成员,不再因为
  `Object.keys(shape)` 仍列着已退役的 `icon` 而假绿。

## 17.5.0

### Minor Changes

- bb68488: Stop declaring 14 symbols under names `@objectstack/spec` owns at `17.0.0-rc.6`
  (objectui#4167, objectstack#4115).

  The rc.6 bump published nine names this repo already declared locally, on top of
  four that predate it — `check:spec-symbols` reported all thirteen at once, and a
  fourteenth (`GlobalFilterSchema`) appeared during the bump itself. Each was
  triaged on its own rather than blanket-renamed, because the right answer differs
  per symbol: five bind to the spec, three are renamed because the spec's
  same-named export means something else, five arrive by derivation, and one is a
  declared dialect with a written reason.

  **Breaking for importers of `@object-ui/react`, `@object-ui/app-shell` and
  `@object-ui/types`** — three exported names changed, because the spec exports the
  same name for a _different_ thing:

  | package               | was                | now                            | what the spec's same-named export actually is                                                                                                          |
  | :-------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `react` / `app-shell` | `MetadataState`    | `MetadataCacheState`           | a metadata item's LIFECYCLE state — `'draft' \| 'active' \| 'deprecated' \| 'archived'` (`MetadataStateSchema`, `@objectstack/spec/system`)            |
  | `react` / `app-shell` | `resolveI18nLabel` | `resolveKeyedI18nLabel`        | a resolver for the INLINE per-locale map (`{ en: 'Owner', 'zh-CN': '负责人' }`) against a BCP-47 locale                                                |
  | `types`               | `DateRangePreset`  | `FilterBuilderDateRangePreset` | the thirteen HISTORICAL dashboard filter-bar presets; this one is the filter-builder set, which adds eight FUTURE windows the dashboard schema rejects |

  `resolveI18nLabel` is the one where the collision had already started costing
  something. rc.6 widened `I18nLabel` from `string` to
  `string | Record< string, string >`, so the same authored value now reaches
  either resolver — and each answers wrongly, silently, for the other's input: the
  keyed one returns `undefined` for `{ en: 'Owner' }` (no `key`, no
  `defaultValue`), and the spec's reads `key` / `defaultValue` / `params` as locale
  tags. The rc.6 bump PR met this and aliased the spec's import as
  `resolveInlineI18nLabel` in five files, with hand-written comments at two of
  them. That is a review convention, which is what objectstack#4115 exists to
  replace with a rule — so `Keyed` is now the counterpart of that `Inline`, and the
  name says which vocabulary it resolves at every call site.

  **Eleven keep their names and are now imported or derived from the spec** instead
  of re-declared: `DATE_RANGE_PRESETS`, `NavigationMode`, `AddressValue`,
  `BreakpointColumnMap`, `BreakpointOrderMap`, `KanbanConfig`, `CalendarConfig`,
  `GanttConfig`, plus the three renamed above at their new names.

  **Four of the copies were losing information, not just duplicating it.**

  - **`GanttConfig` declared six keys and called itself canonical; rc.6's
    `GanttConfigSchema` declares seventeen.** The eleven it never mentioned —
    `parentField`, `typeField`, `baselineStartField`, `baselineEndField`,
    `groupByField`, `resourceView`, `assigneeField`, `effortField`, `capacity`,
    `quickFilters`, `autoZoomToFilter` — are all read by
    `plugin-gantt/src/ObjectGantt.tsx`, through a local `GanttConfigEx`
    intersection that existed only because this type did not carry them. It now
    derives from the spec, with `timeSegments` (shift segmentation) as the one
    genuinely local extension; the schema is `$loose` upstream, so that key is
    legal metadata rather than a second dialect.
  - **`GanttConfig.tooltipFields` carried the comment "not part of the upstream
    GanttConfigSchema".** It is, as of rc.6, so the key now arrives from the spec.
  - **`AddressValue` declared five of the spec's seven parts** — `countryCode` and
    `formatted` were missing, under a comment already claiming to be "the part
    names of `AddressSchema`". The widget still renders five inputs; binding the
    type stops it from asserting the platform cannot store the other two, and makes
    the `{ ...address }` write-through say so.
  - **`DATE_RANGE_PRESETS` was `Object.keys(PRESET_RANGES)`,** a third copy of a
    vocabulary the spec extracted in objectstack#4614 precisely to collapse — its
    own doc comment names this module as one of the three. It is now the spec's
    array by reference, and the local date-macro bounds table is pinned complete
    against it with `satisfies`, so a preset the schema gains without bounds here
    is a compile error rather than a filter that validates clean and then selects
    nothing.

  `NavigationMode` was one hop from the spec already (`NavigationConfig['mode']`);
  it is bound directly, with a both-directions type pin that it stays the same type
  as the config's own `mode`. `KanbanConfig` / `CalendarConfig` /
  `BreakpointColumnMap` / `BreakpointOrderMap` were exact hand copies of `$strict`
  schemas and are now re-exports — "still exact" is the argument for binding them,
  since a copy with nothing to protect can only drift.

  `GlobalFilterSchema` is the one ALLOW entry. It is the same spread-composition
  dialect as `SelectOptionSchema` next to it, and it collided only because rc.6's
  new refinement forced `.extend()` to be respelled as a `.shape` spread — which
  moved a derivation the guard could see into an object literal it deliberately
  does not descend into. The dialect is unchanged and its three divergences are
  pinned; which side moves on the refinement itself is objectui#4165.

  `@objectstack/spec` moves from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in
  `@object-ui/layout`: its public type surface now references the spec.

### Patch Changes

- f650253: `BaseSchema.ariaLabel` declares the keyed i18n vocabulary the renderer actually
  resolves, `.disabled` accepts the predicate string it actually evaluates, and the
  keyed shape finally has a name (objectui#4581)

  Three slots on one base type had drifted from what the renderer does with them.
  PR #4593 fixed `visible` and measured the rest; these are the rest.

  `ariaLabel` was `string`, but `SchemaRenderer.tsx:111` resolves it with
  `resolveKeyedI18nLabel`, whose input is the KEYED form
  `{ key, defaultValue?, params? }` — a reference into a translation bundle. It is
  now `string | KeyedI18nLabel`, and `KeyedI18nLabel` is a new exported type in
  `@object-ui/types` rather than a fourth inline copy of one object literal: the
  three that existed (`@object-ui/react`'s resolver, `@object-ui/layout`'s
  `resolveLabel`, `@object-ui/app-shell`'s `t`-taking twin) were verified identical
  in their object half first, and two of them now import the name.

  The vocabulary matters more than the widening. `#4581` originally asked for
  `string | I18nLabel`, and that spelling was withdrawn as measured-wrong: the
  spec's `I18nLabel` is the INLINE LOCALE MAP (`string | Record<string, string>`),
  a different vocabulary resolved against a BCP-47 locale by a different function
  of a confusingly similar name. Under it the shipped keyed fixture type-checked
  only vacuously — as a locale map whose "locales" are named `key` and
  `defaultValue` — the same label carrying `params` was rejected outright, and a
  genuine `{ en: 'Owner' }` compiled while rendering an EMPTY `aria-label`. Naming
  the keyed shape is the declaration half of the fix objectui#4167 started on the
  naming side; `@object-ui/app-shell`'s copy keeps its inline spelling for now
  because an open PR has a pending change to that file, and the comment there says
  so.

  `disabled` was `boolean` on a key the renderer never reads as one:
  `SchemaRenderer.tsx:466` evaluates it through the same `evaluateCondition` as
  `visible`, and a `disabledOn?: string` sibling exists for the same reason. It is
  now `boolean | string`. The asymmetry with `visible` was accidental rather than
  deliberate.

  Both are widenings on authored-input-dominant properties: authors gain a
  spelling, nothing that type-checked before stops doing so, and readers already
  coped with `any` through `BaseSchema`'s index signature. Three test fixtures that
  had been casting past these declarations with `as unknown as BaseSchema` state
  their values directly now, and the declared unions are pinned invariantly so
  neither a missing widening nor an overshoot to `any` can pass unnoticed.

  Declaring the vocabulary honestly also surfaced a real one: the `toggle`
  renderer writes `aria-label` itself instead of going through SchemaRenderer's
  resolver, and it forwarded the raw value. Invoked directly it emitted
  `aria-label="[object Object]"` for a keyed label — announced verbatim by a
  screen reader. It resolves now. Through `SchemaRenderer` the bug was invisible,
  because SchemaRenderer injects its own resolved `aria-label` afterwards; a
  downstream type-check sweep found it, not a test.

  `BaseSchema.label` and `.description` are deliberately unchanged and pinned that
  way. They receive the spec's inline `I18nLabel` from the view bridges, which is a
  real defect, but resolving it belongs at the spec-to-schema boundary rather than
  in this declaration — and that work is still blocked on a design question about
  where the display locale enters, so it is not in this release.

- bb68488: An inline per-locale label now renders its locale's string at the thirteen read sites the `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0-rc.6 bump exposed

  rc.6 widened `I18nLabel` from `string` to `string | Record<string, string>`, so an author may write `label: { en: 'Owner', 'zh-CN': '负责人' }` anywhere the spec accepts a display label. PR #4169 repaired eight such sites; these thirteen were invisible to it because the five packages involved build through vite/rolldown, so `turbo run build` never type-checks their sources — only `turbo run type-check` does. All thirteen are now resolved through a shared resolver against a real locale, and `turbo run type-check` is 78/78 with zero errors.

  | package                       | what an author can now write and see                                                    |
  | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `@object-ui/layout`           | `NavigationArea.label` — the sidebar area switcher's button and its tooltip             |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-list`      | `ViewTab.label` — the inline pill row, and the mobile dropdown's trigger and menu items |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` | `DashboardWidget.title` — the widget card heading and its `title` attribute             |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-designer`  | `DashboardWidget.title` — the widget card and the preview tile                          |
  | `@object-ui/app-shell`        | `ActionParam.label` **and** each `ActionParam.options[].label`                          |

  **Patch, not minor, in every case: no public surface changes meaning.** Every entry above is a read site that previously could only be reached with a value the type system rejected, so no caller's working code changes behaviour. `@object-ui/app-shell` is the only package with an exported-type change and it is purely additive on the authoring side — `RawActionParam.label` and `RawActionParam.options[].label` widen to `I18nLabel` (they accept strictly more), `ResolveActionParamsContext` gains an optional `locale`, and the new `RawActionParamOption` names the authoring shape that was previously spelled with the resolved one. What `resolveActionParams` **emits** is unchanged: `ActionParamDef.label` and its options' labels are still plain `string`s.

  Two consequences worth knowing:

  - **The dashboard designer's title input is deliberately read-only for a map-valued title.** Resolving a per-locale map into a single-line input and writing `e.target.value` back would collapse every other locale on the first keystroke, so the write is guarded and an inline map survives an unrelated edit-and-save round trip untouched — the same conservative branch #4169 took for `DashboardWidgetInspector`. What Studio should actually offer for authoring a per-locale label is objectui#4163 part 2, which is unclaimed and pending design.
  - **`@object-ui/layout` resolves at the spec's `en` default, not the viewer's language.** That package carries no i18n dependency by design (its whole i18n story is injection), and `AppSchemaRendererProps` exposes no locale to thread. The choice and what would change it are documented at the call site.

### Patch Changes

- 6bd6a4d: `registerLayout()` 的 `inputs` 声明面与渲染器实现对齐 —— 校验器不再对正确写法报假诊断

  `inputs` 是**作者面**:`sdui-parser/src/validate.ts` 拿一个节点的顶层属性逐个比对
  `comp.inputs`,不在其中的报 `unknown-prop`,类型不符的报 `type-mismatch`;设计器面板、
  `sdui.manifest.json`、生成的 JSX 类型也都由它派生。所以声明面写错的代价不是"文档不全",
  而是**校验器对着能正常渲染的 schema 说谎**(objectui#3972,与 objectui#3900 同族、换到属性面)。

  两处修正,都是按渲染器**实际读点**审计出来的:

  - **`page-header` 补声明 `icon` 与 `actions`。** 两个键三面齐全:渲染器真读
    (`PageHeader.tsx:117` 取参 `:224-226` 渲染 icon;`:119` 取参 `:192-196` 把 actions
    委派给 `record:quick_actions`)、`@objectstack/spec/ui` 的 `PageHeaderProps` 声明、
    `ManifestInputType` 表达得了(`string` / `array`)。`content/docs/layout/page-header.mdx`
    的 Component Props 段落也把两者写成公开契约,而该文档页**唯一**的 live demo
    (`layout-page-header/pageheader-with-actions`)就写着 `"icon": "users"` —— 于是仓内
    自己的文档示例每次过 manifest 门都收到一条 `unknown-prop: page-header has no prop "icon"`。
    `actions` 的类型与 canonical 的 `page:header` 逐字一致(`type: 'array'`),一个概念一个键
    一种类型。
  - **`navigation-renderer` 的 `items` 由 `type: 'object'` 改为 `'array'`。**
    `NavigationRendererProps.items` 是 `NavigationItem[]`(`NavigationRenderer.tsx:108`),
    而 `checkType` 对 `'object'` 判 `typeof value === 'object' && !Array.isArray(value)`、
    对 `'array'` 判 `Array.isArray`(`validate.ts:124-129`)—— 两者互斥。所以旧声明对这个
    渲染器**唯一能渲染的形状**报 `type-mismatch ... expected an object`,而对真会让它崩的
    对象形状一言不发。这不是 objectui#3832 的表达力问题:`ManifestInputType` 本来就有
    `'array'`,只是声明写错了一个表达得了的类型。

  **刻意不声明**的键同样被钉住,因为"照抄 spec 的 shape"是这条修复最容易滑进去的反向缺陷:
  `breadcrumb`(spec 有、这个渲染器零读点 —— 声明它就是 objectui#3829 的缺陷方向)、
  `showBack` / `action` / `description`(渲染器读、spec 无此键 —— 声明任一个就是在开第二套
  方言,正是 objectui#3226 收窄要防的事)、`aria`(每个 block 都因同一理由省略的可访问性逃逸口)。

  渲染输出逐字节不变:渲染路径从不读 `inputs`。变化只在校验/设计器/清单这一侧,且两个方向
  都钉了 —— 正确写法放行的同时,`description` 这类刻意不声明的键仍报 `unknown-prop`、
  `items` 写成对象仍报 `type-mismatch`(诊断没有被弄哑)。

- 876e3f7: `@object-ui/layout` no longer tells bundlers it has no side effects while registering components at load time (objectui#3899)

  The published manifest declared `"sideEffects": false` — a promise that no module
  in the package does anything on evaluation, so any module whose exports go unused
  may be dropped whole. But `src/index.ts` ends with a bare
  `try { registerLayout(); } catch {}`, and that call is the only thing that puts
  `page-header`, `page:card`, `app-shell`, `responsive-grid`,
  `navigation-renderer` and `app-schema-renderer` into the `ComponentRegistry`.

  Both statements cannot be true, and a bundler that believes the manifest is
  right to delete the registration. Measured with the repo's own bundler by
  building `import '@object-ui/layout';` — the side-effect-only import, i.e. the
  documented "import it to register" pattern:

  - `sideEffects: false` — the bundle is **0 bytes**. Zero registrations, exit
    code 0, no warning.
  - after this change — the bundle keeps all six `ComponentRegistry.register`
    calls.

  A dropped registration does not fail where it happened. It surfaces later as a
  red `Unknown component type` panel (OBJUI-001) on a fully green build, with
  nothing in the build log to connect the two. Nobody had been bitten yet only
  because every consumer today ALSO imports a named export, which forces the module
  to be evaluated regardless — coincidence, not design. objectui#3787 met the
  hazard and routed around it by calling `registerLayout()` explicitly.

  `sideEffects` is now the narrowest honest answer: an array naming the modules
  that actually register, rather than `true`, which would be honest but would hand
  the whole package to every bundler as unshakeable.

  ```json
  "sideEffects": ["./dist/index.js", "./dist/index.umd.cjs", "./src/index.ts"]
  ```

  All three are load-bearing, and the set is derived from the manifest rather than
  guessed:

  - `./dist/index.js` and `./dist/index.umd.cjs` are every JS file the manifest's
    own entry fields point at (`module` / `main` / `exports` import+require). The
    library build inlines everything into those two files, so there is no third
    chunk to name.
  - `./src/index.ts` is not published (`files` ships `dist` only) but is bundled
    for real: `apps/console` and `examples/console-starter` both alias the
    specifier straight at `packages/layout/src`, and a bundler reads this same
    manifest for those files. With only the published paths declared, the console's
    alias shape still produced a 0-byte bundle.

  What deliberately did NOT change: the load-time `registerLayout()` itself.
  Replacing it with an explicit registration API is the opposite direction — it
  eliminates the side effect instead of declaring it, and it is breaking for any
  consumer relying on automatic registration. objectui#3899 leaves that call to the
  maintainer, and the two steps do not conflict: once the manifest tells the truth,
  the migration to explicit registration can happen whenever it is wanted.

  A new pin (`packages/layout/src/__tests__/side-effects-manifest.test.ts`) runs a
  real bundler build per entry form and asserts the registrations survive a
  side-effect-only import, with a `sideEffects: false` control per form asserting
  they are dropped — so the pin cannot pass because the bundler stopped shaking
  anything. The required set is derived from the manifest's own entry fields, so a
  renamed build output or a new `exports` subpath fails as a missing declaration
  instead of drifting silently.

- f3b2874: `navigation-renderer` 的 `items` 声明为 `required: true` —— 校验器不再放过必崩的节点

  `items` 在组件侧是**非可选**的 `NavigationItem[]`(`NavigationRendererProps.items`,无 `?`),
  渲染器也不给默认值,而注册声明一直没写 `required`。`sdui-parser` 只在 `input.required` 为真时
  报 `missing-required-prop`(`validate.ts:55-64`),于是 `{ "type": "navigation-renderer" }`
  这个节点**校验零诊断、渲染直接抛**:第一处无守卫的读点是 `pinnedItems` memo 里的
  `collectPinnedItems(filteredItems)`(`NavigationRenderer.tsx:1242` → `:1410` 的
  `for (const item of items)`),实测 `TypeError: items is not iterable`。
  (`resolveActiveNavItem` memo 挡得住 —— 它的 `visit` 首行是 `if (!nodes) return`;
  `:1247` 的 `filteredItems.slice()` 同样会抛,但根本走不到。)

  这是 objectui#3972(键的**存在**与**类型**三面对齐)的第四面:**可选性**。#3972 与
  objectui#3900 都是删除假诊断,这一条相反——它是**收紧**。

  **blast radius:** 今天省略 `items` 写 `navigation-renderer` 的 schema,会新增一条
  **error** 级 `missing-required-prop`。受影响面是仓外按 `inputs` / `packages/layout/README.md`
  做 schema 驱动的消费者(仓内没有任何 JSON 元数据把它当 schema 节点写,React 调用侧的必填由
  TS 兜住;`examples/schema-catalog` 的 `not-a-container` 对照节点补了 `items: []`,使它只剩
  那一处故意植入的缺陷)。而这条诊断新拦下的形状,**恰好等于渲染必然崩溃的形状** —— 让作者
  (尤其是 AI 作者)在发布期就听到运行期注定要发生的失败,正是 `missing-required-prop` 存在
  的理由。若某个消费者确实想要"缺 items 就渲染空导航",那是给组件加 `= []` 默认值的另一条路
  (objectui#3987 里记了,与本改动不互斥),而不是让校验器继续沉默。

  `basePath` **保持可选**并被钉成对照:渲染器真的给了它默认值(`basePath = ''`)。`required`
  是逐个属性从组件读出的事实,不是一刀切——否则这道门会开始拒绝完全能渲染的 schema,作者就会
  学着无视 `missing-required-prop`,正如 #3972 里他们被教着无视 `type-mismatch`。

- 82f8dff: `page-header` 注册补 `isContainer: true` —— 校验器不再对文档承诺的 children 写法报 `not-a-container`

  `PageHeader` 一直**有意**把 `schema.children` 渲染进右侧动作槽(`PageHeader.tsx:182`,
  `record:quick_actions` 嵌在 `page:header.children` 下就是靠它),
  `content/docs/layout/page-header.mdx` 把该槽的优先级(`action` → React `children` →
  `actions` → schema children)写成公开契约,该文档页唯一的 live demo
  (`layout-page-header/pageheader-with-actions`)正是这个形状且实测正常渲染。但
  `packages/layout/src/index.ts` 的注册漏了 `isContainer: true`。

  漏这个 flag 从来没有挡住任何渲染 —— 渲染路径根本不读它(`SchemaRenderer` 把
  `children` 从 React props 里剥掉当元数据,而始终把整个节点作为 `schema` 传下去,
  `PageHeader` 自己再把 `schema.children` 放回槽里)。它的消费者在别处:`sdui-parser`
  的 `not-a-container` 诊断、Studio 调色板元数据、react-page 标签表。所以真正的后果是
  **校验器在说谎**:作者照文档写出能正常渲染的 schema,却拿到一条
  "`page-header` does not accept children" 的 warning;信了这条 warning 去掉 children,
  右槽就空掉。而会说谎的 warning 比缺一条 warning 更贵 —— 它训练作者(尤其 AI 作者)
  连真实的 `not-a-container`(那些确实不收子节点的组件)一起无视。

  这不是在 spec 之外新开作者面:`children` 是 objectui JSON 协议里**每个节点**的基础属性
  (`sdui-parser/src/validate.ts` 的 `BASE_PROPS` 把它和 `type`/`id`/`className` 并列),
  不是 `PageHeaderProps` 的键。所以这个 flag 回答的是协议层面的"该节点是否接受子节点列表",
  而对这个组件,答案一直是"是"。维护者 2026-08-09 就 objectui#3900 的 A/B 分叉裁定 A 案,
  理由同上。

  行为面变化极窄:注册元数据一个布尔位。渲染输出逐字节不变(渲染路径不读该 flag);
  `sdui-parser` 对带 children 的 `page-header` 少报一条 warning;设计器把它当容器对待
  (即它本来的样子)。canonical 的 `page:header`(`@object-ui/components`)不在此列且刻意不动
  —— 那个渲染器完全不读 `schema.children`,所以它没有 `isContainer` 是正确的。

  两个方向都已钉住:文档 demo 走应用真实构建的 manifest 后不再产生 `not-a-container`,
  而一个真正不收子节点的组件(`navigation-renderer`)带 children 时诊断照旧触发 ——
  后者是前者的对照,保证这条修复不是把诊断弄哑了。

## 17.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 608669e: `AppSchemaRenderer` now derives area visibility from the items inside the
  area, closing the visible-but-empty regression the spec 17.0.0 area-key
  retirement left behind (objectui#3311, option C of the recorded ruling).

  Spec 17.0.0 retired the authorable area-level `visible` /
  `requiredPermissions` (`AREA_VISIBLE_RETIRED` /
  `AREA_REQUIRED_PERMISSIONS_RETIRED`) — an area is a layout grouping, not an
  access boundary — and objectui followed in #3315 by deleting the area
  switcher's filter. Correct on the contract, but it changed the navigation
  surface: an area whose items are **all** gated away used to disappear from
  the switcher and instead rendered as a selectable, empty area.

  ## What changed

  - **Area visibility is now derived, not authored.** An area appears in the
    switcher iff at least one of its navigation items survives the exact
    item-level guards `NavigationRenderer` applies: the `visible` expression,
    `requiredPermissions`, the `requiresObject` / `requiresService` runtime
    capability gates, and — for `action` items — the presence of an `onAction`
    dispatcher (framework#4509: without one they are not rendered, so they
    cannot carry an area either). Separators never count; a `group` counts only
    through its children.
  - **The active area is elected among visible areas only.** A fully gated
    first area is no longer auto-activated, and when a gating change hides the
    currently active area the shell re-elects the first visible one. A gating
    change that merely _reveals_ an area never yanks the user away from where
    they are.
  - **An area with no items at all derives the same way**: no visible item →
    hidden. (Boundary recorded in objectui#3311.)
  - New export `hasVisibleNavigationItems(items, options)` from
    `@object-ui/layout` — the predicate behind the derivation, usable by other
    shells that render their own area switchers.

  No authorable key is involved anywhere: the platform's `.strict()` area
  object still rejects the retired keys, and the derivation — computed from the
  same guards that decide what renders — cannot disagree with the rendered
  navigation, so there is nothing for a metadata author to get wrong.

- d22ae31: Track `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0-rc.2 (objectui#3235, #3208, #3287, #3264).

  The pin moves from `^17.0.0-rc.1` to `^17.0.0-rc.2` across the workspace, and
  the sibling `@objectstack/*` packages (`client` / `core` / `formula` / `lint`)
  move with it — they pin `@objectstack/spec` **exactly**, so leaving them behind
  kept a second copy of the spec in the tree and would have had `@objectstack/lint`
  validating against rc.1 schemas that still accept keys rc.2 retires.

  Breaking semantics, in FROM → TO form:

  - **`app.homePageId` is retired — an app's landing page is now its first
    navigation item.** An app that pinned a landing page with `homePageId` will
    open on the first reachable navigation entry (by `order`) instead; the root
    landing still follows `isDefault`. To restore a specific landing page, reorder
    `navigation` so the intended entry comes first. Stored metadata is migrated by
    `os migrate meta --from 16`. The key is a hard error now, not a stripped one:
    the spec ships a tombstone that names the migration.
    Upstream retired it because of its SHAPE, not its usage — it was an ID
    cross-reference with no referential integrity, so a `homePageId` that pointed
    at nothing silently fell back to the first navigation item anyway
    (objectstack#4667, premise corrected in #4709). If the capability returns, it
    returns as a flag on the navigation item itself, which cannot dangle.
  - **`@object-ui/types`' `HttpMethod` now resolves to the spec's
    `HttpMethodType`.** Shape is verbatim identical — the same 5-value UI subset —
    and `@object-ui/types` still exports it as `HttpMethod`, so no consumer
    changes. The spec renamed its `./ui` export because `HttpMethod` named two
    different types depending on the import path (`./shared` / `./api` carry a
    7-value enum including `HEAD` / `OPTIONS`); objectui deliberately keeps the
    5-value one (objectstack#4691).
  - **`AppContextSelector.includeAll` / `placement` are gone.** Neither ever did
    anything in this renderer: context selectors are mandatory-scope, so no "All"
    row was ever rendered, and `placement: 'topbar'` put nothing in the topbar.
    Both carried schema defaults, which is why the liveness lint structurally
    could not flag them — removal was the only channel that reaches an author
    (framework#4509).
  - **`NavigationArea.visible` / `order` / `requiredPermissions` are gone.** An
    area is a layout grouping, not an access boundary. Gating moved down to the
    navigation ITEM, where `visible` and `requiredPermissions` are unchanged and
    still enforced. `AppSchemaRenderer`'s area switcher no longer hides an area, so
    an area whose items are all gated away renders as visible-but-empty rather
    than disappearing.
  - **`@object-ui/core` no longer exports `NotificationProtocol`**
    (`resolveNotificationConfig`, `specNotificationToToast`, `mapSeverityToVariant`,
    `mapPosition`, `ToastNotification`). It bridged `@objectstack/spec/ui`'s
    `Notification` / `NotificationConfig`, which objectstack#4610 deleted with no
    successor. Use `resolveNotificationConfig` from `@object-ui/react`
    (`NotificationContext`), which owns the live `NotificationSystemConfig` and is
    what every notification surface already read. Note that the spec's _other_
    `Notification` — `@objectstack/spec/api` — is the REST inbox row, a different
    contract, and is deliberately NOT aliased in as a replacement.
  - **The `email_template` client-side validator now uses
    `EmailTemplateDefinitionSchema`.** It was pointing at the removed
    `EmailTemplateSchema`, so authored templates were being checked against the
    wrong contract: the live one is keyed `name` + `locale` (not `id`) and splits
    the body into `bodyHtml` / `bodyText` (not `body` + `bodyType`)
    (objectstack#4616 / #4807).

  Fixes that are not breaking, but were only found because rc.2 stopped being
  lenient — each had been passing vacuously:

  - **`view` drafts are actually validated now.** The client validator named the
    aggregated container schema while this admin authors first-class `ViewItem`s,
    and the container used to strip `viewKind` / `config` in silence — so no view
    draft ever had one of its own keys checked. It now validates each shape
    against its own schema (objectui#3312).
  - **The console's worked examples were wrong**, and being stripped rather than
    refused: `view.list.object` (the container root already declares it),
    `job.concurrency` / `job.timeoutMs` (no such keys; the spelling is `timeout`,
    already in ms), `email_template.from` / `.to` (a template is not a send —
    the sender override is `fromOverride`, an object), and
    `datasource.capabilities` / `.healthCheck` (objectstack#4583 removed the
    former; the latter was never a datasource key). These are the drafts an
    author — or a model generating metadata — copies.
  - Action key inventory re-derived: `ActionSchema` gained the package-lock
    envelope (`_lock*` / `_package*` / `_provenance`), so a packaged action no
    longer reports them as unknown keys.
  - The schema-diff panel labels the new `default_mismatch` finding.
  - Test fixtures pinning the retired `managedBy: 'system'` bucket now use
    `engine-owned`. Protocol 17 split that value (objectstack#3355), so it
    resolved to the default-writable fallback and a batch of "stays locked"
    assertions had quietly stopped asserting anything.

### Patch Changes

- d2363e7: The legacy `page-header` alias stops advertising `description` as an authorable
  key (objectui#3226).

  FROM: `registerLayout()` declared `inputs: [title, description]`. TO:
  `inputs: [title, subtitle]` — the key `@objectstack/spec/ui`'s `PageHeaderProps`
  declares, and the one the canonical `page:header` renderer in
  `@object-ui/components` already declares.

  `inputs` is a DECLARATION surface, not documentation: the designer builds its
  property palette from it, and the framework's `check:react-declaration-parity`
  diffs it against the spec schemas. Declaring `description` therefore did not
  merely tolerate a legacy spelling — it published a second dialect for the one
  concept the protocol calls `subtitle`, and told authors (an AI author most
  readily, since the registry is what it reads to learn the shape) that the
  non-spec key was legal. Metadata that took the offer renders a subtitle under
  `page-header` and silently loses it under `page:header`: same JSON, two results,
  which is the outcome a single contract exists to prevent.

  No runtime behaviour changes. `PageHeader` still reads `subtitle ?? description`,
  deliberately: this alias exists for out-of-repo consumer schemas, so "no in-repo
  author writes `description`" (verified — zero hits) is not evidence that nobody
  does, and dropping the read today would delete an external page's second line
  while its title kept rendering, the least reportable failure mode there is. That
  read is retired together with an ADR-0087 D2 conversion entry
  (`page-header-subtitle-alias`, `description` → `subtitle` rewritten at load
  time), which lives in the framework repo and is tracked separately. Narrowing the
  declaration did not need to wait on it and breaks no consumer; leaving the
  declaration wrong in the meantime keeps minting the metadata the conversion would
  then have to absorb.

  New tests pin both halves so neither can drift back: the registration may not
  declare `description`, must declare `subtitle`, and — checked against the spec's
  own shape rather than a hand-written allowlist — may declare nothing
  `@objectstack/spec` does not; while the runtime fallback is pinned as a sequencing
  guard, to be deleted in the same change that lands the conversion entry.

## 17.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a51e77: Stop declaring 14 symbols across ten packages under names `@objectstack/spec`
  owns (objectui#3161, objectstack#4115 batch 7 — the long tail, one or two
  entries per package). All ten packages leave the ledger, which drops from 17
  collisions across 11 packages to 3 across 1.

  **Renamed exports** — in every case the spec exports the same name for a
  _different_ thing, so the old name was a mis-description rather than a dialect:

  | package                    | was                                | now                                                  | what the spec's same-named export is                                                                                                       |
  | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `@object-ui/fields`        | `FieldWidgetProps`                 | `FieldWidgetComponentProps`                          | the DECLARED field-widget plugin props contract (a zod object; `field.type` is the `FieldType` enum, `readonly`/`required` carry defaults) |
  | `@object-ui/layout`        | `PageHeaderProps`                  | `PageHeaderComponentProps`                           | the authored `page:header` node — a zod schema of `title`, `subtitle`, an icon NAME, `breadcrumb`, `actions: string[]`                     |

  | `@object-ui/plugin-grid`   | `ColumnSummaryConfig`              | `ColumnSummarySetting`                               | the OBJECT form of `ListColumn.summary` **only** — the local one was the whole union, shorthand included                                   |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-grid`   | `isMultiValueField`                | `hasMultiValueShape`                                 | the spec's classifier, which requires a def with a `type`; the local one is called with `undefined`                                        |
  | `@object-ui/collaboration` | `RealtimeConfig`                   | `RealtimeSubscriptionConfig`                         | the app's realtime DECLARATION (`enabled`, `transport`, `subscriptions[]`)                                                                 |

  | `@object-ui/plugin-form`   | `FormSection` / `FormSectionProps` | `FormSectionContainer` / `FormSectionContainerProps` | the authored form-section metadata (`name`, `pane`, `visibleWhen`, `fields`)                                                               |
  | `@object-ui/providers`     | `Theme`                            | `ThemePreference`                                    | a whole theme DOCUMENT (`name`, `label`, `colors`, `typography`)                                                                           |
  | `@object-ui/runner`        | `App` (default export)             | `RunnerApp`                                          | the authored application metadata type **and** the `App.create()` builder                                                                  |
  | `@object-ui/sdui-parser`   | `ValidationResult`                 | `ManifestValidationResult`                           | plugin-manifest validation (`{ valid, errors?, warnings? }`), exported from both `kernel` and `contracts`                                  |

  `ManifestValidationResult` follows the `<what was validated>Validation<Error|Result>`
  convention registered on objectstack#4115 (`@object-ui/core` took
  `SchemaNodeValidationResult` in batch 4). `PageHeaderComponentProps` deliberately
  reuses the name `@object-ui/app-shell` already chose for its own header props in
  batch 3, so one concept does not acquire two dialect names one package apart.

  **Now derived from the spec instead of hand-written:**

  - `@object-ui/fields` — `isFileIdToken` is re-exported from
    `@objectstack/spec/data`. The local copy was character-for-character identical
    to the spec's function while its comment said it "mirrors" it, so every
    behaviour test passed and only reference identity could tell the two apart.
    The regex is a wire decision: widening it server-side while a copy here kept
    the old bound would make every new id read as "not a reference", and the
    widget would submit the legacy inline blob to a backend expecting a reference.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail` — `FeedFilterMode` is re-exported from
    `@objectstack/spec/data`, in a file that already imported the sibling
    `FeedItemType` from the spec.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-grid` — the eleven-member aggregation union is now the
    spec's `ColumnSummary` enum, so the total `Record<ColumnSummaryType, string>`
    label map turns a member the spec adds into a compile error instead of a
    blank footer cell. `ColumnSummarySetting` is `NonNullable<ListColumn['summary']>`,
    i.e. whatever forms the spec itself accepts. `hasMultiValueShape` delegates to
    the spec's `isMultiValueField` rather than re-deriving it from
    `MULTI_OPTION_TYPES` / `MULTI_CAPABLE_TYPES`.
  - `@object-ui/providers` — `ThemePreference` is the spec's `ThemeMode` union
    plus the one legacy `'system'` spelling this provider still honours for stored
    preferences, read off the schema's own `_zod` carrier so the package takes no
    zod dependency.

  `@objectstack/spec` moves from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in
  `@object-ui/fields` (it re-exports a runtime function) and `@object-ui/providers`
  (its public `.d.ts` now references the spec).

  Scored `minor`, not `major`, per this repo's fixed-group rule — objectui's major
  tracks `@objectstack`, so breaking changes of our own ship as minor with the
  semantics spelled out above (see AGENTS.md §版本号策略). A `major` here would carry
  all 39 packages of the fixed group to `18.0.0` and off objectstack's 17.x line.

- 07de7be: Navigation `action` items actually run now (framework#4509).

  A `type: 'action'` nav item rendered, gated like any other item, and did
  **nothing** when clicked. `NavigationRenderer` dispatches such a click to an
  `onAction` prop it expects the host shell to supply — it deliberately never
  reads `item.actionDef` itself — and no shipped sidebar supplied that prop. So
  `actionDef.actionName` reached no dispatcher: an author could put an action in
  the menu, watch it render with its icon and label, and never find out that
  clicking it was a no-op. The framework's liveness ledger recorded this as the
  single gap in the AppSchema navigation surface.

  **New `useNavActionDispatch`** (`@object-ui/app-shell`) resolves the nav item's
  `actionName` against `action` metadata at click time — the same source
  `DeclaredActionsBar` reads for a record toolbar — and dispatches the resolved
  definition through `useAction()`. `UnifiedSidebar` now passes it. No new
  provider is involved: the sidebar already renders inside `ConsoleShell`'s
  `GlobalActionRuntimeProvider`, so nav actions get the fully-wired console runner
  including the confirm, param-collection, result and navigate dialogs. A declared
  `params` array becomes the runner's param-dialog input, and the nav item's own
  `actionDef.params` is passed as the value bag, so a menu entry can pre-fill the
  action it launches.

  Nav actions are inherently **global**: `ActionNavItemSchema` is strict with
  exactly `{ actionName, params? }` and carries no `objectName`, so resolution is
  by name alone and no record context rides along.

  **Behaviour change:** a shell that passes no `onAction` no longer renders
  `action` items at all, instead of rendering them dead. This mirrors the existing
  capability guards — an item the host cannot serve is hidden — and it makes the
  omission diagnosable: a missing prop now shows up as "my action item is gone",
  which leads to the prop, rather than "clicking does nothing", which for three
  releases led nowhere. Every failure at dispatch time (an unnamed item, an
  unresolvable action, a throwing action) warns and toasts instead of returning
  silently.

- 6d868e1: Remove `PageNodeRenderer`, the dead page-node renderer (objectui#3223, ADR-0049
  enforce-or-remove).

  **Removed:** the `PageNodeRenderer` export and its `./Page` module. It was
  registered under no component key and imported by nothing — a whole-repo grep
  found zero call sites — so it reached consumers only through
  `export * from './Page'` in the package barrel. `registerLayout()` was already
  saying so in a note that told the next reader _not_ to register it. Its props
  were also `{ schema: PageNodeSchema; … } & any`, and an intersection with `any`
  absorbs the whole type, so the signature asserted nothing beyond "there is a
  schema".

  **Migration:** there is nothing to re-point in a working app — an unregistered
  renderer had no call site to migrate. If you imported the symbol directly:

  ```diff
  -import { PageNodeRenderer } from '@object-ui/layout';
  +import { PageRenderer } from '@object-ui/components';
  ```

  `PageRenderer` in `@object-ui/components` is, and remains, the renderer for the
  `page` component key. It is the one that supports page types
  (record/home/app/utility), named regions and `PageVariablesProvider` — the
  deleted one rendered a header plus children and nothing else. Schema-driven
  consumers are unaffected: a `{ type: 'page' }` node has always resolved through
  the registry to `PageRenderer`, never to this export.

  Also note: this supersedes the `Page` → `PageNodeRenderer` rename shipped for
  this package in the batch 7 symbol burn-down — the renamed symbol is gone rather
  than renamed again. `PageHeaderProps` → `PageHeaderComponentProps` from that same
  batch is unaffected.

  Scored `minor`, not `major`, per this repo's fixed-group rule — objectui's major
  tracks `@objectstack`, so breaking changes of our own ship as minor with the
  semantics spelled out above (see AGENTS.md §版本号策略). A `major` here would carry
  all 39 packages of the fixed group to `18.0.0` and off objectstack's 17.x line.

### Patch Changes

- b5b97e2: fix(types,layout): nav item type `component` joins `NavigationItemType` and its zod enum — objectui#2918

  The renderers have carried a full `type: 'component'` implementation (Phase 3b:
  `componentRef` colon-split to `/component/<ns>/<name>`, `params` serialised as
  querystring, `metadata:*` special-cases) — but the vocabulary never gained the
  member, and `@objectstack/spec` has had `ComponentNavItem` all along. The zod
  enum was the part that bit: `NavigationItemTypeSchema` rejected
  `type: 'component'` at validation time, so authors could not declare one and
  the renderer half was unreachable — dead on arrival rather than dead code.

  - `NavigationItemType` and `NavigationItemTypeSchema` gain `'component'`;
    `NavigationItem` gains the fields the renderer consumes, `componentRef` and
    `params` (also used by `type: 'page'`), mirroring spec's `ComponentNavItem` —
    declared in zod too, so parse no longer strips them.
  - The `(item as any).componentRef` / `params` casts in `NavigationRenderer`
    and `AppSchemaRenderer` become typed access.
  - `NavigationDesigner`'s exhaustive type-meta map gains a `component` badge
    (new `appDesigner.navTypeComponent` key in all 10 locales).
  - `@object-ui/layout` gains `type-check` (src + tests) with the #2915 `paths`
    override; its DEBT entry in `check-type-check-coverage.mjs` is deleted.

### Patch Changes

- ebe6494: chore(lint): clear the baseline lint errors in nine more packages (objectui#2713 Wave 2)

  Second wave of the #2713 lint-gate restoration (after #2730). These nine package
  lints were red at baseline on `main`, so their per-package `lint` gate could not
  catch new violations. Cleared every **error** (no behavior change; warnings out
  of scope):

  - **`react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`** (`i18n`, `plugin-grid`, `plugin-view`,
    `plugin-list`) — translation helpers (`useSafeFieldLabel`,
    `useRowActionTranslation`, `useViewLabel`, `useViewTabLabel`, `useMoreLabel`)
    wrapped a provider-safe hook (`useObjectTranslation`/`useObjectLabel`, which
    never throw) in try/catch; removed the wrapper (the same fix #2709 applied in
    fields). `plugin-kanban` `ObjectKanban` moved its `if (error)` early return
    below the `useCallback` so hooks run unconditionally. `collaboration`
    `__unsafe_usePresenceContext` keeps its deliberate danger-prefix name via a
    justified scoped disable.
  - **`react-hooks/static-components`** (`layout`, `plugin-list`, `plugin-report`)
    — dynamic-icon / registry lookups (`resolveIcon`, `useRegistryComponent`) are
    stable component references, not components created during render → scoped
    disable with justification. `plugin-charts` `TreemapCell` was a _genuine_
    inline component and is hoisted to module scope (it is purely props-driven).
  - **`no-irregular-whitespace`** (`plugin-grid` `ImportWizard`) — the literal
    U+FEFF BOM prepended to exported CSV/text blobs (so Excel detects UTF-8) is
    now written as the `﻿` escape: byte-identical at runtime, no literal
    irregular-whitespace character in source.
  - **`no-useless-assignment`** (`plugin-grid` `BulkActionDialog`) — dropped a
    dead `= null` initializer that the exhaustive `switch` (incl. `default`)
    overwrites before it is read.
  - **`no-unsafe-function-type`** (`plugin-view` `ViewTabBar`) — the dnd-kit
    render-prop `listeners` map is typed `Record<string, (...args: any[]) => void>`
    instead of bare `Function`.
  - **`no-require-imports`** (`plugin-kanban`, `plugin-view` tests) — hoisted
    `vi.mock` factories use an `async` factory with `await import('react')`.

### Minor Changes

- 06e92ac: feat(console-ai): ChatDock — right-docked AI rail behind a default-off flag (ADR-0057 P3a)

  Stands up the ADR-0057 P3 docked rail as an ADDITIVE, DEFAULT-OFF shell: until an
  operator sets `features.chatDock`, nothing changes and the FAB stays the
  canonical entry.

  - `@object-ui/layout`: `AppShell` gains an optional `rightRail` prop, rendered as
    a flex sibling of the main content so the rail REFLOWS the content beside it
    (VS Code / Cursor idiom), not overlaying it. Absent → unchanged single-pane.
  - `@object-ui/app-shell`: new `ChatDock` — a collapsible, resizable right rail
    that reuses the shared `ChatPane` engine over the P1 `(user, app, product=ask)`
    conversation (the same ambient thread the FAB/`/ai` shows; it's a VIEW, not a
    new conversation). Default COLLAPSED (a fixed edge launcher → zero layout cost
    until invoked); ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+I toggles it. Gated on `useAiSurfaceEnabled` AND
    the flag, so OSS / no-seat runtimes render nothing.
  - `runtime-config`: `chatDock?` rollout flag, parsed default-OFF (opt-in only).

  Live-verified with the flag forced on: the launcher expands to a rail rendering
  the ask chat, the dashboard content reflows narrower beside it, and collapse
  restores the launcher. Unit-tested: width clamp, the composer-safe shortcut
  matcher (⌘⇧I, no collision with the ⌘⇧O/S page shortcuts), and the flag's
  default-off/opt-in parse. FAB retirement (P3b) and `/ai`-as-maximized-dock +
  Studio reflow (P3c) follow.

### Minor Changes

- e7b6eae: `NavigationRenderer` now resolves a group's initial open state with two
  platform-aware defaults:
  1. **`expanded` field honored.** `@objectstack/spec` `AppNavigation`
     uses `expanded: true | false` on group items; objectui historically
     only read `defaultOpen`. App authors who wrote `expanded: false`
     would see no effect because the renderer silently fell back to the
     "open unless `defaultOpen === false`" rule. Both field names now
     resolve to the same explicit override.
  2. **Auto-collapse long groups.** When the author has set neither
     `expanded` nor `defaultOpen`, groups with **8 or more direct
     children** default to collapsed. Long sidebar sections (e.g. 10+
     reports) doubled the sidebar height and pushed siblings below the
     fold — Slack, Linear, and Notion all default-collapse oversized
     sections for the same reason. Short groups (typical 3–6 items) still
     open by default.
  3. **Active-route override.** Both heuristics are bypassed when the
     current route lives inside the group, so users never lose visual
     orientation to a hidden active item.

### Patch Changes

- b703480: feat(layout): smoother sidebar transitions

  `SidebarNav` now animates the previously-instant state changes:

  - Active-state colour swap on `SidebarMenuButton` /
    `SidebarMenuSubButton` is wrapped in `transition-colors duration-150`
    so navigating between rows glides rather than snaps.
  - `CollapsibleContent` (group children) fades + slides in / out when
    the parent group is expanded/collapsed (chevron already rotated;
    the children now match).

  All animations are gated on `motion-safe:` so users with
  `prefers-reduced-motion` see the original instant UI.

### Patch Changes

- 95b6b21: feat(page:header): record-aware chip + dedupe registrations (Phase D)

  The `page:header` schema renderer is the visual anchor of every custom
  record detail page (lead, opportunity, future account/contact/case).
  Before this change it had two problems that bled into every custom
  page across the product:

  1. **Quadruple registration**: `@object-ui/layout` registered both
     `page-header` and `page:header`, and `@object-ui/components`
     independently registered `page:header` (and `page:section`).
     Whichever package loaded last won the unqualified `page:header`
     lookup — visually unstable.
  2. **Bare `<h1>`** with no record affordances (no icon, ★ favourite,
     copy-id, edit, ⋯ menu) — every custom page shipped a thinner header
     than the default detail view it was meant to supersede.

  This commit:

  - Removes the `@object-ui/layout` `page:header` registration. The
    layout package keeps the legacy kebab-cased `page-header` alias only.
    The canonical renderer now lives in `@object-ui/components` and is
    always the one resolved.
  - Upgrades `PageHeaderRenderer` to render a `<RecordTitleChip>` when
    wrapped in a `RecordContext`. The chip mirrors the default detail
    header: title (resolved from `data.name` / `data.title` /
    `data.display_name`, or an interpolated `schema.title`), a favourite
    star, the object label, and a copy-record-id button. Authors opt out
    via `recordChrome: false` or hide individual affordances with
    `showStar: false` / `showCopyId: false`.
  - Extracts the chip into a new shared `RecordTitleChip` component in
    `@object-ui/components/custom`. It carries an inline zh-CN/zh-TW
    dictionary for star/copy tooltips so it stays i18n-correct without
    pulling in a translation dependency.
  - Fixes `interpolate()` so a `{account}`-style token that resolves to
    a related-record object renders as empty instead of
    `"[object Object]"`. Authors who want a field of the related record
    should use a deeper path (`{account.name}`).

  Verified at 1440×900 on `lead_detail` and `opportunity_detail`:
  both pages now show the same chip with star + copy-id and the
  opportunity highlights strip looks coherent with the chip above it.

### Patch Changes

- d714e85: Lookup display-name resolution now falls back through a Salesforce-style chain
  when an `$expand`'d reference object lacks a top-level `name`/`label`/
  `display_name`/`title` field:

  1. Standard display fields (existing behaviour)
  2. `salutation first_name last_name` composite — handles person records that
     only carry first/last name parts
  3. `email` — last-resort identifier, beats the opaque id

  Applies to `LookupCellRenderer`, `PageHeader.subtitle` interpolation,
  `DetailView` page-mode `titleFormat`, and the shared `formatRecordTitle`
  utility. Concretely: a Contact reference with `first_name: Bob`, `last_name:
Lin` and no `name` field now renders as `Bob Lin` everywhere — instead of
  the email or [object Object] fallback.

## 4.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 67dabe1: feat(page-header): first-class `actions` property on page:header

  PageHeader now accepts an `actions: ActionDef[]` (or string[]) property
  and renders the toolbar inline in the header's right-aligned action slot.
  Removes the need for authors to declare a sibling `record:quick_actions`
  node and the `-mt-12` visual offset hack to pair the toolbar with the
  title. The hack still applies for legacy schemas using the sibling form
  (via location:'record_header'); the new in-header rendering opts out via
  an `inline: true` flag automatically set by PageHeader.

### Patch Changes

- 63eb66d: fix(detail): expand lookup fields so subtitle + lookup cells show display names

  The record-page fetch in `RecordDetailView` (the page-mode path) now
  requests `$expand` for every lookup/master_detail field on the object,
  mirroring the behaviour the legacy `DetailView` already had. Combined
  with two small downstream fixes — `PageHeader` subtitle interpolation
  now extracts `name/label` from expanded reference objects instead of
  rendering `[object Object]`, and `LookupCellRenderer` now short-circuits
  to `pickRecordDisplayName` when the value is already a nested record —
  all `record:*` renderers and the page header subtitle (`Owned by
{account}`) now display the related record's name rather than the raw
  foreign-key id.

- ef0e30d: feat(page-header): back-to-list arrow on record pages

  `page:header` now renders a ← back arrow at the left when a record
  context with an id is present. Clicking it strips the trailing
  `/record/{id}` segment from the URL so users return to the object list,
  falling back to `history.back()` for deep-linked entry. The legacy app
  pages without a record context are unaffected.

- 2bd45af: feat(shell): main becomes the scroll container; record tabs are sticky

  - `AppShell`'s SidebarProvider wrapper is now constrained to viewport
    height (`h-svh overflow-hidden`) instead of expanding with content via
    the default `min-h-svh`. This makes the inner `<main>` (which is
    `overflow-auto`) the actual scroll container instead of the window.
  - `RecordDetailView` page-mode container drops the redundant
    `h-full overflow-auto` (avoids nested scrollers; main owns scroll now).
  - `page:tabs` (horizontal) gets `sticky top-0 z-20` with a translucent
    backdrop so the tab strip stays visible while users scroll through
    long record pages — the Salesforce Lightning behaviour our schemas
    were already implying.

### Patch Changes

- 6b683c8: fix(detail): clean up record page rendering

  - Drop `ai:chat_window` from the protocol-component placeholder list. The
    floating chat overlay (plugin-chatbot) is the canonical AI entry point;
    inline page schemas that still reference `ai:chat_window` now surface
    as an explicit "Unknown component type" so the misconfiguration is
    fixed at the source instead of silently leaking a placeholder card.
  - `page:header` now resolves `{field.path}` tokens in `title` / `description`
    against the current record context (matching the behaviour of the
    alternative `containers.tsx` renderer). Without this, schemas like
    `title: "{first_name} {last_name}"` rendered the literal template.
  - `containers.tsx` `PageHeaderRenderer`: also read from `schema.properties.*`
    as a fallback so both inlined and raw-bag schema shapes are supported.

- 0d8eb98: feat(detail): Salesforce-style record header + section field grid

  - `page:header` now renders an icon chip (resolves Lucide names via
    `LazyIcon`) plus subtitle, so detail pages can show
    "Name / Company" without an extra component.
  - `record:details` normalises string field entries (`fields: ['email']`)
    into the `{name, label?}` shape expected by `DetailSection`, and maps
    section `label` → `title`. Schemas authored against `@objectstack/spec`
    now produce a real grouped field grid instead of an empty card.

### Patch Changes

- 1dc6061: fix(build): inline dynamic imports in library outputs

  Library `vite build --lib` outputs were emitting separate code-split chunks
  (`rolldown-runtime-*.js`, `LookupField-*.js`, etc.) when source files used
  `React.lazy()` / dynamic `import()`. When consumer apps re-bundled these
  multi-file dists, the library's per-chunk rolldown-runtime collided with the
  consumer's own runtime, causing "TypeError: i is not a function" at runtime
  when lazy components tried to register themselves (e.g. TextField in
  `@object-ui/fields` after 4.0.4).

  Adding `output.inlineDynamicImports: true` to all `@object-ui/*` library vite
  configs forces a single `dist/index.js` per package, which lets consumer
  bundlers handle the library as an opaque ESM module without identifier
  mismatches across chunks.

  Affected packages: components, fields, layout, plugin-aggrid, plugin-ai,
  plugin-calendar, plugin-charts, plugin-chatbot, plugin-dashboard,
  plugin-designer, plugin-detail, plugin-editor, plugin-form, plugin-gantt,
  plugin-grid, plugin-kanban, plugin-list, plugin-map, plugin-markdown,
  plugin-report, plugin-timeline, plugin-view, plugin-workflow.

## 4.0.4

### Patch Changes

- d2b6ece: fix: externalize all bare imports in library builds

  Library builds (vite lib mode) now externalize every non-relative import instead of bundling third-party CJS dependencies into the published dist. This avoids inlined `require("react")` / `require("react-dom")` calls that cause `Calling \`require\` for "react" in an environment that doesn't expose the \`require\` function` runtime errors when consumer apps re-bundle the published dist.

  Specifically fixes:

  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` no longer inlines `react-grid-layout` (and its transitive `react-draggable` / `react-resizable` CJS bundles). `react-grid-layout` is now declared as a peer dependency so consumers install a single ESM-friendly copy.
  - `@object-ui/components`, `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/plugin-charts`, `@object-ui/plugin-designer` no longer inline `react-i18next` / `i18next` / `use-sync-external-store` CJS shims.
  - All plugin packages now use a unified `external: (id) => !/^[./]/.test(id) && !id.startsWith(__dirname)` rule, ensuring future additions of CJS deps are automatically externalized.

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).
