 * stays exported and stays in use — `ObjectKanban` renders it — it is only the
 * REGISTRY KEY that is gone.
 *
 * ## The measurement the ruling was taken on
 *
 * Exact node-type spellings, whole repo: `kanban-ui` was authored 0 times in
 * JSON and 0 times in TS/TSX as a registry-resolved node, against a firing
 * control of 2 JSON / 128 TS occurrences for the live sibling `object-grid` and
 * a silent control (`zzz-not-a-type`, 0). ⇒ a registered type key no document
 * in this repository has ever authored. Declaring an arm for it would have
 * committed the repo to a validation face for a spelling with no writers — the
 * opposite of what ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove asks.
 *
 * ## Why unregistering is the whole retirement
 *
 * ⚠️ `BaseSchema` closes with `[key: string]: any` and `BaseSchemaCore` ends
 * `.passthrough()`, so a dropped MEMBER KEY is KEPT, not refused (objectui#7664).
 * That hazard needs a schema face to arise on, and this key never had one:
 * measured whole-repo, `@object-ui/types` declares `kanban-ui` as a component
 * node type ZERO times (firing control: `object-kanban`, 2 — `objectql.ts` and
 * its Zod mirror). There is no arm to convert into a named refusal.
 * ⇒ Registration-only retirement.
 *
 * ## ⭐ What this closed as a side effect — objectui#8818
 *
 * `SchemaRenderer` strips a fixed, enumerated metadata list and spreads the
 * REST as React props. When this registration was retired `objectFields` was
 * not on that list, and `KanbanRenderer` — then registered here for
 * `kanban-ui` — declares `objectFields` as a real prop (objectui#7742). So an
 * AUTHORED `objectFields` reached the predicate layer verbatim on this entry,
 * with no schema face declaring or judging it. Retiring this registration
 * closed that ENTRY: nothing resolves `kanban-ui` any more, so no authored node
 * reaches `KanbanRenderer` through the registry.
 *
 * The CLASS is closed as well, at the boundary: since objectui#8818
 * `objectFields` is on `SchemaRenderer`'s stripped-metadata list, and the
 * legacy `props` alias bag drops it too, so an authored value reaches no
 * component prop on any type key, whichever renderer declares the prop next.
 *
 * Pinned in `src/__tests__/kanban-family-registry-keys-retired-8257.test.ts`.

 *
 * ## What went, and what went with it
 *
 * The registration read `onColumnToggle`, `enableVirtualScrolling` and
 * `virtualScrollThreshold` off `schema` and declared them as `inputs`, while
 * `@object-ui/types` declared no `kanban-enhanced` arm at all: the type was
 * dispatched by the registry and validated by nothing but `BaseSchema`'s
 * passthrough. ⇒ Re-measured on this branch and CONFIRMED rather than assumed:
 * with the registration gone those three keys have NO authorable surface left
 * anywhere in the repo — 0 declarations on any schema face, 0 remaining
 * `inputs` entries, 0 read sites (firing control on the same instrument:
 * `groupBy`, which keeps 1 declaration + read sites on the surviving
 * `object-kanban` face). objectui#8257's question is resolved by the removal of
 * its subject, not by an answer.
 *
 * ## The measurement the ruling was taken on
 *
 * `kanban-enhanced` was authored 0 times in JSON and 0 times in TS/TSX, against
 * the same firing control (`object-grid`, 2 JSON / 128 TS) and silent control
 * (`zzz-not-a-type`, 0) the `kanban-ui` note above cites.
 *
 * `KanbanEnhanced` was NOT, and never had been, reachable from outside this
 * package: `package.json` `exports` publishes exactly two entries — `.` and
 * `./style.css` — and this barrel never re-exported the component, so
 * `@object-ui/plugin-kanban/KanbanEnhanced` was never a resolvable specifier
 * for a consumer. (An earlier revision of this note claimed it was; that claim
 * was wrong and is corrected here rather than deleted, because it is what a
 * reader would otherwise copy.) What this card removed is the registry key and
 * the `React.lazy` wrapper that existed only to serve it. It left the module
 * itself on disk, with zero non-test importers, because deleting published
 * source is a further narrowing that needed its own maintainer ruling.
 *
 * ⚠️ That ruling came: objectui#8932 (2026-09-11, ratified 2026-09-24) deleted
 * `KanbanEnhanced.tsx`, the two test references it had left, and with them the
 * `dist/KanbanEnhanced.d.ts` typings the package still emitted for it. (Through
 * 17.6.0 the component itself was also bundled into `dist/index.js`, behind the
 * `kanban-enhanced` key; it left the bundle with this card's retirement.)
 *
 * Pinned in `src/__tests__/kanban-family-registry-keys-retired-8257.test.ts`
 * (the key) and `src/__tests__/kanbanEnhancedRetired-8932.test.ts` (the file).

/**

 * resolveRowLimit(schema.limit, DEFAULT_KANBAN_LIMIT)`).
 *
 * `limit` was unmapped until objectui#4025, on the rationale that the board
 * "fetches with a fixed `$top: 100`, so there is no key to write it to". That
 * rationale was false in a way nobody could see from here: the cap was written
 * `{ options: { $top: 100 } }`, and `options` is not a `QueryParams` key — no
 * adapter reads it, so the window was not fixed, it did not exist. #4025 moved
 * the cap to a real top-level `$top` and made it read `schema.limit`, so the
 * flag comes with the read site (the order `object-timeline` did it in, #4009)
 * and a bound view's `pagination.pageSize` now actually caps the board.
 *
 * Still deliberately NOT mapped:
 *
 * - `columns` — a board's `columns` are its SWIMLANES (`{ id, title }` per
 *   `groupBy` value), not a field projection; a saved view's field list written
 *   there would render one empty lane per field name.
 *
 * `sort` IS mapped (objectui#10068). The binding declares it for every element
 * (`ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT`, the spec's `ElementDataSourceSchema`), and it
 * used to be accepted here and dropped: the board fetched with no `$orderby`.
 * The fetch now lowers it onto `$orderby` the way every sibling block does
 * (`convertSortToQueryParams`), so the order is the server's. Lanes keep that
 * order: records are bucketed by `groupBy` in fetch order and nothing re-sorts
 * a lane. There is no manual in-lane rank to contend with — a same-lane drop
 * persists nothing and the board claims no position (objectui#8826).
 *
 * ⚠️ `schema.sort` is the GATE's carrier for `dataSource.sort`, not an authoring
 * key on this block: the spec's `object-kanban` props declare no top-level

/**
 * The authoring surface both `ObjectKanbanRenderer` tags publish, spelled ONCE
 * and spread into both registrations (objectui#8201).
 *
 * ## Why it is shared rather than hand-copied
 *
 * `object-kanban` and `view:kanban` are the SAME renderer, so the only way the
 * two lists could ever disagree is a hand-copy that missed one — which is
 * precisely what this card found: `filter` reached both because objectui#8186
 * edited both, but nothing structural said it had to.
 *
 * ## Why these keys were added
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s `ComponentPropsMap['object-kanban']` declares FOURTEEN
 * top-level keys on the installed 17.4.0 pin; this list published three until
 * objectui#8186 added `filter`. ⚠️ It declared THIRTEEN when objectui#8201 was
 * filed — 17.4.0 added `limit` (see below), and the count moved with it. Both
 * numbers are correct about their own pin, which is why this one names its pin.
 * The gap was STRUCTURAL rather than considered — the console registers this
 * block with `ComponentRegistry.registerLazy` and `getConfig` is loaded-only by
 * design, so the block sat outside the console's reverse-parity population
 * entirely until objectui#8176 loaded it. objectui#8201 asked the per-key
 * question that census never got to ask.
 *
 * Each key below was measured against a read site that CHANGES BEHAVIOUR on the
 * `ObjectKanban` path — not a mention, and not a read site belonging to the
 * sibling `kanban-ui` block, which is a different renderer with a different
 * declared surface:
 *
 *   - `groupBy` — `ObjectKanban.tsx` materializes the lanes from this field's
 *     picklist options, `bucketCardsIntoColumns` buckets records by its value,
 *     and a drag between lanes writes the new value back to the record.
 *   - `cardTitle` / `titleField` — one choice with two spellings, `cardTitle`
 *     first; it selects the record field rendered as the card title.
 *   - `swimlaneField` — becomes `effectiveSchema.swimlaneField`, which
 *     `KanbanImpl` splits the board into horizontal swimlanes on (and keys its
 *     per-lane collapsed-state storage by).
 *   - `coverImageField` — `bucketCardsIntoColumns` maps it onto each card's
 *     `coverImage`, which `KanbanImpl` renders as the card's `<img>`.
 *
 * objectui#8313 added the four ARRAY/OBJECT-armed keys the same census left
 * behind. Each was measured at ITS OWN SINK rather than assumed to share one,
 * because the four sinks answer four different questions and only one of them
 * is a pass-through:
 *
 *   - `data` — read TWICE, and the two reads differ. As a GATE it SUPPRESSES
 *     the board's own query; as a VALUE, `rawData = external || boundData ||
 *     schema.data || fetchedData` selects it and `effectiveData` REBUILDS every
 *     member into a card, so it is not a pass-through and no identity claim is
 *     true of it. ⚠️ The gate is DOUBLY guarded on the authored-node path, and
 *     naming only one guard would be wrong: `SchemaRenderer` spreads
 *     non-metadata schema properties as React props, so an authored `data`
 *     arrives as `schema.data` AND as this component's `data` prop — which
 *     makes `hasExternalData` true and returns from the fetch effect at its
 *     first line, BEFORE `if (schema.objectName && !boundData && !schema.data)`
 *     is reached. Measured, not reasoned: removing either guard alone leaves
 *     the query suppressed and the member pin green; removing both makes the
 *     board query and reddens both of its gate rows by name.
 *   - `cardFields` — `resolveKanbanCardFields(schema.cardFields, objectDef)`,
 *     exported and pure. It answers WHICH FIELD NAMES the author chose, which
 *     is a different question from which cells a card ends up carrying: the
 *     card loop further drops a name that duplicates the title and one whose
 *     value is empty. Both are measured; the pin says which row is which.
 *   - `grouping` — one nested position and no more:
 *     `schema.grouping?.fields?.[0]?.field` is the FALLBACK for
 *     `swimlaneField`. Everything else inside `grouping`, later `fields`
 *     entries included, is inert on this board — which is why the declared
 *     description says so rather than implying a shape the board does not read.
 *   - `conditionalFormatting` — the only one this file reads NOWHERE.
 *     `ObjectKanban.tsx` never names it (measured: zero occurrences, against
 *     nine for `cardFields` in the same file); it travels on the
 *     `{ ...schema }` spread into `effectiveSchema` and then into
 *     `KanbanRenderer`, which forwards it to `KanbanImpl`'s `getCardStyles`.
 *     An edit replacing that spread with an explicit key list would drop the
 *     key silently, and the member pin is the only thing that would notice.
 *
 * ## What declaring them widens, and on what grounds (clause ②)
 *
 * Declaring an input WIDENS the authoring surface, so the grounds are stated
 * rather than assumed. They are the same grounds objectui#8186 (`filter`) and
 * objectui#8223 (`sort`) cleared on: the SPEC already declares all five and the
 * RENDERER already honours all five, so this restores `declared = enforced`
 * instead of publishing anything new. Measured with a control on the same
 * `safeParse` call — because "the spec declares it" is an assumption
 * objectui#8172 once falsified for `limit`: four faces taught the key and the
 * strict `ComponentPropsMap` refused it BY NAME. ⚠️ That reading is HISTORY as of
 * @objectstack/spec 17.4.0. objectstack#16503 (landed as objectstack#16562)
 * added `limit: z.number().int().positive().optional()` to
 * `ComponentPropsMap['object-kanban']` — the maintainer's option-A ruling on
 * objectui#8172, the contract catching up with a capability that was already
 * implemented, typed, mapped and documented — so `limit` is DECLARED below with
 * the others. Re-measured here rather than inherited: all four faces now agree
 * (renderer `$top: schema.limit ?? DEFAULT_KANBAN_LIMIT`; BOTH `@object-ui/types`
 * faces, TS and zod; `content/docs/plugins/plugin-kanban.mdx`; the spec).
 * ⛔ The declaration carries NO default: a materialised `limit` would defeat the
 * gate's `readLimit(base) === undefined` branch, and a bound view's
 * `pagination.pageSize` would then never fill it. `DEFAULT_KANBAN_LIMIT = 100`
 * stays documented rather than declared. An unrecognised probe key draws
 * `unrecognized_keys` on these calls while none of the declared keys does.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT here yet
 *
 * ONE of the fourteen keys stays undeclared, keeping its live entry in
 * `apps/console/src/__tests__/registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts`:
 *
 *   - `quickAdd` is RULED, and the ruling is PREMATURE. This renderer does not
 *     honour it at all: `KanbanImpl` gates the control on `quickAdd &&
 *     onQuickAdd`, and `onQuickAdd` is an objectui#6124 RUNTIME SLOT the zod
 *     twin refuses by name; nothing on the `ObjectKanban` path supplies one.
 *     objectui#8201 escalated the DISPOSITION rather than guessing it, and the
 *     PM answered (Q1 = A, 2026-09-07): PREMATURE — the renderer does not
 *     honour it, and objectui#8285 owns the fix.
 *     ⭐ PREMATURE commits nobody to building quick-add. It is also NOT the
 *     stronger reading that the object-bound board is not going to grow it:
 *     nothing measured supports that, and `KanbanRenderer` below contradicts
 *     it by forwarding the same `quickAdd` + `onQuickAdd` pair by identity to
 *     a React host that can supply the function.
 *     ⛔ The exit is NOT a declaration — publishing the key would advertise
 *     configuration this renderer drops. objectui#8285 was ruled (director
 *     seat 2026-09-08, decision batch #91) to retire `object-kanban.quickAdd`
 *     from the spec's `ComponentPropsMap`; the day that lands, the key leaves
 *     the accepted set and the console entry is harvested by its own dangling
 *     and stale checks. Pinned from this side by
 *     `__tests__/quickAddIsDiagnosedNotDropped-8285.test.ts` row 5, whose
 *     reddening IS that day.
 *
 * The declarations are pinned per tag and per key, so removing one from this
 * list reddens a NAMED row rather than a file:
 * `__tests__/scalarKeysAreDeclaredAndHonoured-8201.test.ts` for the five scalar
 * keys, `__tests__/structuredKeysAreDeclaredAndHonoured-8313.test.ts` for the
 * four array/object-armed ones. The MEMBER shape of those four — the second
 * obligation objectui#8212 created, which a declaration pin cannot carry — is
 * `__tests__/ObjectKanban.structuredMembersReachTheirSinks-8313.test.tsx`.

 *
 * ## What this dissolves rather than patches
 *
 * The two published faces of this key returned OPPOSITE verdicts on the same
 * document: the registry `inputs` above (shared into both registrations by
 * objectui#8201) declared `titleField`, while the `kanban` Zod arm refused it
 * BY NAME after batch #70. With the key gone there is no arm left to disagree
 * with — objectui#8802's four options are all moot.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Unlike its `gantt` / `kanban-ui` / `kanban-enhanced` siblings, this one
 * had a DECLARED FACE, so unregistering is only half of it
 *
 * `@object-ui/types` declared `KanbanSchema` with `type: 'kanban'` and mirrored
 * it in `zod/complex.zod.ts`. A plain deletion there would have been the
 * objectui#7664 failure: `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`, so a document naming
 * a dropped spelling validates GREEN and renders nothing. The Zod arm is
 * therefore a NAMED REFUSAL (`retiredNodeType()`, `zod/tombstone.zod.ts`)
 * pointing the author at `object-kanban`, and the TS face leaves `ComplexSchema`
 * and `SchemaRegistry` so `tsc` refuses the literal at the authoring site.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Two layers, and only one of them moved
 *
 * `kanban` is ALSO a STORED `NamedListView.type` — the value `CreateViewDialog`
 * writes and every tenant's database holds. That layer is untouched:
 * `packages/plugin-view/src/ObjectView.tsx`'s `switch (viewType)` already emits
 * `object-kanban` for a stored `kanban` view, as it emits `object-*` for all
 * twelve view types. ⇒ Every kanban view any user ever created through the
 * console already renders through the surviving spelling; this retirement moves
 * zero stored documents.
 *
 * Pinned in `src/__tests__/kanban-family-registry-keys-retired-8257.test.ts`
 * and `@object-ui/types`' `__tests__/bare-kanban-node-key-retired-8802.test.ts`.
