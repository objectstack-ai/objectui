/**
 * objectui#4376 — a value that is byte-identical to `en` inside a NON-LATIN pack
 * is untranslated, and nothing in the i18n gate family could say so.
 *
 * `list.loading` was the specimen: `en` says `Loading records…` and so did
 * `ja`, `ko`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, `pt`, `ru` and `ar` — eight of the nine packs
 * served the raw English sentence, `zh` alone had translated it. A Japanese,
 * Korean, Russian or Arabic user reading a list view saw a Latin-script English
 * sentence in the middle of an otherwise translated screen, and in `ar` it was
 * left-to-right text inside a right-to-left layout. Three more keys were in the
 * same state: `designer.undo`, `designer.redo` and `appDesigner.snakeCaseHint`.
 *
 * ## Why no existing gate sees it — the value-domain blind spot, fourth instance
 *
 * This is the same hole as objectui#3582 / #3625 / #3810, one more shape:
 *
 *   - `all-locales-key-parity` compares key SETS and placeholder shapes. All
 *     four keys were present in all ten packs with matching holes: full parity,
 *     green, and correctly so — asking a key-set test to judge meaning is how
 *     you get a test that owns nothing clearly.
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` asks only whether a key RESOLVES.
 *     All four resolved.
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` fires on an `en` VALUE CHANGE. These
 *     values were identical from the day the packs landed, so no drift event
 *     ever existed for it to fire on. It is blind to a value that was never
 *     right rather than one that stopped being right.
 *   - `ellipsis-glyph-3878.test.ts` scans the GLYPH, not the sentence. It is why
 *     `list.loading` surfaced at all — converging its ellipsis made the
 *     untranslated body of the value obvious — but its green says nothing here.
 *
 * ## The probe, and why it is scoped to the five non-Latin packs
 *
 * `value === en[key] && /[A-Za-z]{4,}/.test(value)`, over `zh`/`ja`/`ko`/`ru`/`ar`
 * only. In a pack whose script is not Latin, a real translation of a run of four
 * or more Latin letters essentially cannot be byte-equal to the English, so
 * identity is decidable evidence of omission rather than a hint.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT extended to `de`/`fr`/`es`/`pt`, where identity can be
 * genuine — `Standard`, `Import`, `Text` and friends are simply the same word,
 * and a probe that flagged them would be a false-positive generator whose
 * allowlist grew without bound. That scoping has a real cost and it is stated
 * rather than hidden: `list.loading` was ALSO untranslated in `de`/`fr`/`es`/`pt`,
 * and `appDesigner.snakeCaseHint` in `pt`, and this file cannot see either. Both
 * were fixed by hand in the same change; a Latin-pack omission still needs a
 * human to notice it. objectui#3582 measured the inverse probe ("no ASCII English
 * in a non-Latin pack") and found it produces false NEGATIVES; this is the
 * narrower, decidable form of the same idea.
 *
 * The `{4,}` floor is what keeps acronyms and units out of the report without an
 * allowlist entry each: `URL`, `API`, `ID`, `CSV`, `KB`, `v1` and the bare
 * `{{count}}`-style format strings never reach the identity check at all.
 *
 * ## The allowlist is the cost, and it is keyed by KEY, not by key+lang
 *
 * The keys below are byte-identical to `en` in at least one non-Latin pack and
 * are RIGHT that way — proper nouns, protocol and format names, example
 * addresses, generated filenames, and pure interpolation. Each carries a
 * one-line reason so the next reader can re-judge it instead of trusting it.
 * (This sentence used to state the entry count. It said 22 while the list held
 * 23, because nothing asserts the number and additions did not have to touch it;
 * the count is deleted rather than corrected so the prose cannot drift again —
 * the list itself is the count, and `no dead entries` below is what keeps it
 * honest.)
 *
 * Key-level rather than key+lang is a deliberate trade: it is looser (an entry
 * excuses the identity in all five packs, not just the one that has it today)
 * but it does not churn every time another pack legitimately adopts the same
 * proper noun. `assert the allowlist has no dead entries` below is what pays for
 * the looseness — an entry that stops being an identity anywhere has to be
 * deleted, so the list cannot quietly accumulate cover for keys it no longer
 * describes.
