 * objectui#7234 — an object-declared action DOES reach the toolbar, and the
 * thing that hides it is the capability gate, not the relay.
 *
 * ## What the card predicted, and what was measured
 *
 * #7234 reports that an action declared on `objectDef.actions[]` with valid
 * `locations` renders at NO location, although the API serves the complete
 * declaration — and points at the relay, on the shape of objectui#7199 (a
 * per-view `description` served but never copied onto the ListView schema).
 * The `(objectDef as any)?.actions` cast at the `rowActionDefs` rung reads like
 * more of the same: a renderer casting its own object to reach a key.
 *
 * Measured on this tree, the relay is NOT the discard point. Case E below
 * answers the card's exact wire payload from the client the provider actually
 * calls (`meta.getItems('object')`) and walks it through `MetadataProvider`'s
 * own `objects` getter — `extractItems` → `normalizeSchemaReferenceKeys` →
 * `mergeViewsIntoObjects` → `attachInlineSubforms` — into this component's
 * props. The button is in the DOM at the end of it. No hand-built `objects`
 * array is involved in that case, which is what makes it evidence about the
 * chain rather than about the fixture.
 *
 * ## What actually hides it: ADR-0066 D4, `requiredPermissions`
 *
 * `action:bar` filters its own set through `useCapabilityGate` before
 * `actionRendersAt` ever runs, and so do the other two surfaces this card names
 * (`page:header` for `record_header` / `record_more`, the grid's row menu for
 * `list_item`) — one shared hook exactly so the three cannot drift apart. An
 * action declaring a capability the viewer does not hold is filtered out, at
 * every location at once, with no error and no 4xx. That is the reported
 * symptom, and it is this gate rather than a dropped key.
 *
 * The gate fails OPEN on unknown (`systemPermissions` absent → the action
 * shows) and CLOSED on a known array that lacks the capability — including the
 * empty array, which means "holds nothing", not "unknown". Cases F/G/H pin all
 * three readings, and F↔G are one differential: same payload, same code path,
 * only the held set differs.
 *
 * ⚠️ This file therefore pins CURRENT, DELIBERATE behaviour. It is not a fix
 * for #7234 and does not claim one.
 *
 * ## Ruled 2026-09-08, and case J is this file's half of the ruling
 *
 * Whether a declared-but-ungranted action should stay silently invisible was
 * the open question this file was written under. The maintainer ruled option
 * B: the hide STAYS for end users, and the reason becomes visible in an
 * author/admin channel that already exists — the action designer, pinned by
 * `capabilityGateChannel-7234.test.tsx`. Option C (drawing the action greyed
 * out with the missing capability named) was considered and REJECTED, because
 * it advertises to end users capabilities they do not have.
 *
 * ⇒ "No end-user change" is an acceptance criterion of that ruling, not a
 * side effect of it, so it gets a pin rather than a promise. Case J asserts the
 * end-user list surface still explains NOTHING in the gated state: an
 * implementer who lands the author-facing reason on a running app's list
 * surface turns it red. F establishes the button is gone; J establishes that
 * nothing took its place.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification — direction predicted before running
 *
 * Predicted, then observed (measurements recorded on the PR):
 *   • Deleting the `list_toolbar` gate's `objectDef.actions` read in
 *     `ObjectView.tsx` turns every presence case RED (A, D, E, G, I) and
 *     leaves every absence case GREEN (B, C, F, H) — an absence case asserts
 *     absence, which a deleted renderer supplies for the wrong reason. That
 *     asymmetry is why the presence cases carry the claim and the absence
 *     cases are only controls. Measured: 5 failed / 4 passed.
 *   • Making `useCapabilityGate` return `() => true` turns F and H RED and
 *     leaves every other case GREEN, which is what holds the two mechanisms
 *     apart: one ablation cannot redden both sets. Measured: 2 failed /
 *     7 passed.
