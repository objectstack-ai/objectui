/**
 * objectui#5587 — `ObjectChart` reads `fieldOptionLabel` DIRECTLY and still
 * fetches exactly once.
 *
 * `fetchData` used to hide that resolver behind a ref, because
 * `useSafeFieldLabel()` handed back a fresh object on every render outside an
 * i18next provider (objectui#5564). A direct dependency therefore made
 * `fetchData` fresh on every render, and the effect that depends on `fetchData`
 * refetched on every render — an unbounded loop, which is what the ref was
 * written to stop.
 *
 * `useObjectLabel`'s memo now holds on BOTH paths, so the ref is dead weight
 * and the dependency can be honest. This file is what pins that: it asserts a
 * FETCH COUNT across forced re-renders, not rendered output. Nothing renders
 * wrong when the loop is present — the chart just refetches forever — so an
 * output assertion is green against the defect.
 *
 * Ablation, run while writing this file: revert `packages/i18n/src/useObjectLabel.ts`
 * to its pre-#5585 state and both cases below go red with a fetch count in the
 * dozens instead of 1.
 *
 * NOTE ON ORDER: `createI18n` registers its instance as react-i18next's
 * process-global, and `useTranslation` falls back to that global when no
 * context supplies one. The no-provider case therefore runs FIRST, and asserts
 * the raw option label rather than the localized one — if an instance ever
 * leaked into it, that assertion fails instead of the case quietly becoming a
 * second test of the with-provider path.
