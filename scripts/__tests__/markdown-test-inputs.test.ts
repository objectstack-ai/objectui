/**
 * The firing control for objectui#8861 — a markdown-only pull request must now
 * run the shard that reads the markdown.
 *
 * ## Why a green run is not evidence here
 *
 * The defect this file guards is invisible in the one way that matters: it makes
 * CI green. objectui#8857 changed exactly one file,
 * `packages/plugin-dashboard/README.md`, and the test that reads that README
 * extracts its fences and evaluates them. Every check on the pull request page
 * was green — `Test (shard 1/4)` reported success in ten seconds having run
 * nothing — and the merge_group build then failed the same shard in 907 seconds
 * and dequeued the pull request.
 *
 * ⇒ a test that only checks the NEW behaviour cannot tell a working trigger from
 * one that always says `true`, and a test that runs the class derivation without
 * running the workflow cannot tell a correct class from a step that never asks
 * it. So this file drives the REAL step, extracted from `ci.yml` and executed by
 * bash against a real git repository, and it drives it in THREE directions:
 *
 *   fires   the objectui#8857 shape — one package README a test reads — now
 *           yields `should_run=true`.
 *   before  the SAME input through the `type-check` job's copy of the same step,
 *           which is the unwidened shape, yields `should_run=false`. That copy
 *           is not a reconstruction: `ci.yml` carries three copies of this step
 *           and the other two are untouched by this change, so the "before"
 *           answer is a real one taken from the file rather than from history.
 *   inert   an excluded change nothing reads still yields `should_run=false`,
 *           through the WIDENED step. Without this leg, deleting the exclusions
 *           entirely would pass every other assertion in this file.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ objectui#9096 moved the inert leg off markdown, and that is the ruling
 *
 * The inert leg used to add a markdown document nothing reads. That leg is gone,
 * because after objectui#9096 added `scripts` to the scan roots there is no such
 * document: 1734 of 1734 tracked markdown files are opened by at least one test
 * under `scripts/__tests__`. ⛔ So this file does NOT pretend the class stayed
 * narrow. It pins the opposite — `every markdown path is an input` is asserted
 * outright below, so the day that stops being true someone is told — and it
 * moves the inert leg to what the exclusion list still buys: a NON-markdown
 * change under `apps/site/**`, which is the shape of the one commit in the
 * measured 513-merge window that still skips and should.
