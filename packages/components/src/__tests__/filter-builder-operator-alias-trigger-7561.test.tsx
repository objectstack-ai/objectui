/**
 * The operator trigger shows a label for every spelling of the operator the
 * row actually holds (objectui#7561).
 *
 * ## The one site
 *
 * This component already resolves BOTH dialects everywhere the operator's
 * MEANING matters — `filterValueArity` folds through the spec's
 * `normalizeFilterOperator`, and so does `reconcileOperatorForField`. The one
 * place it did not was the operator `Select`'s IDENTITY comparison:
 * `value={condition.operator}` was matched LITERALLY against the mounted
 * `SelectItem`s, whose ids are the dropdown's camelCase vocabulary. A row
 * holding `greater_than` (the spec's canonical spelling) or `gt` (the spec's
 * alias table, which three catalog entries author) matched no mounted item,
 * and Radix drew a BLANK trigger over a row that went on filtering correctly.
 *
 * ⇒ The blank is NOT the vocabulary divergence. It is one site not using this
 * component's own existing normalisation. The repair routes that one
 * comparison through the same fold, and nothing else:
 *
 *   - ⛔ the mirror's accepted set is untouched;
 *   - ⛔ no id a stored filter carries is rewritten;
 *   - ⛔ no second spelling is admitted to the dropdown — the emitted
 *     vocabulary is byte-identical.
 *
 * Which vocabulary should WIN is a separate ruling and is not decided here
 * (objectui#7561's body; note direction 3 there collides with the
 * `contains` / `icontains` ruling cited on objectui#7379 — `AST_OPERATOR_MAP`
 * holds that one operator "must never be folded onto" its sibling).
 *
 * ## DIRECTION, predicted before running
 *
 * Every case in `the trigger names the operator the row holds` is RED on the
 * base tree and green after — EXCEPT the three rows marked `overlap`.
 * `equals` / `contains` / `in` are the three-member intersection of the two
 * vocabularies, so they render a label TODAY; they are carried here as the
 * OVER-REACH guard (a repair that rewrote or re-spelled the row would move
 * them) and are explicitly NOT controls — a pin built only on them could not
 * fail. The sharpest controls are `eq` / `lt` / `gt`, a THIRD spelling that
 * neither vocabulary contains.
 *
 * The four `describe`s below the table are green in BOTH directions by
 * construction: they are the boundaries the repair must not cross, so they
 * fail only for a repair that over-reaches.
