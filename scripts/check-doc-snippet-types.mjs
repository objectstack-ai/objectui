/**
 * Every fenced `ts` / `tsx` snippet in the documentation this gate covers must
 * COMPILE, `--strict`, against the packages' BUILT `dist/*.d.ts` — the surface a
 * reader who copies it actually imports.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-doc-snippet-types.mjs   (also `pnpm check:doc-snippets`)
 *       node scripts/check-doc-snippet-types.mjs --build-filter   (filter args for
 *       turbo or pnpm; each carries the `...` dependency-closure suffix)
 * Exit: 0 = every covered snippet parses and type-checks, the harness proved
 *       itself on its own controls, and the coverage ledger is exact.
 *       1 = THE GATE RAN AND FOUND ERRORS. A snippet failed to parse or to
 *       type-check, or the coverage ledger is stale. Everything printed above
 *       the summary is a verdict about a document.
 *       2 = THE GATE COULD NOT RUN, so nothing printed above is a verdict about
 *       any document: the packages the covered snippets import are not built (or
 *       are typed from source), or one of the harness's own controls failed.
 *       Fix the tree and re-run. Never read this as a documentation defect, and
 *       never as a pass.
 *
 * ## Why "could not run" is its own exit code (objectui#5465)
 *
 * Both 1 and 2 are non-zero, so no caller's pass/fail changes: this gate is
 * invoked from exactly one workflow step (`doc-snippet-types.yml`), which fails
 * on any non-zero, and which builds this gate's own `--build-filter` closure
 * BEFORE invoking it — an unbuilt tree is not a state CI can reach. The
 * distinction exists for the reader. "I could not run" and "I ran and found
 * errors" are different facts, and while they shared one exit code they were
 * indistinguishable at the exit-code level: three separate agents in one evening
 * (objectui#6171, #6186, #5259) each had to notice the printed message and
 * rebuild before their exit code meant anything, and #6171 wrote it down as
 * "an unbuilt-tree exit is indistinguishable from a real failure at the
 * exit-code level". `scripts/check-eager-closure-budget.mjs` had already drawn
 * this same line for this same reason — 1 for "over budget" (a verdict about the
 * bundle), 2 for "the gauge produced nothing" (a verdict about the gauge) — so
 * this is the repository's convention, not a new one.
 *
 * ⛔ What is NOT an option here: printing the reason and exiting 0. Zero with
 * nothing run reads as coverage, which is the exact failure shape this whole
 * gate family exists to prevent (objectui#4846: an unexaminable package must not
 * read as a clean one).
 *
 * ## What this gate answers, and the three things it does NOT (read this first)
 *
 * It answers exactly one question: **does this snippet still compile against the
 * published types.** That catches an import of a symbol the package does not
 * export, a prop or key the type does not have, a signature the call no longer
 * matches, and a key whose TYPE was repurposed underneath the prose.
 *
 * It does NOT answer:
 *
 *   1. **Schema-key validity.** Whether a metadata literal would survive
 *      `ReportSchema.safeParse` is a different question with a different
 *      answer: `@objectstack/spec`'s schemas are strict, so they reject keys a
 *      TypeScript annotation never sees (an object literal assigned through a
 *      widened type, or written with no annotation at all). That is objectui#5138
 *      shape 1, left unruled on purpose — it needs a way to mark which blocks are
 *      complete documents rather than prose fragments, and guessing that boundary
 *      is what produces a gate people learn to ignore.
 *   2. **Whether a `type` literal names a registered component.** That is
 *      `scripts/check-doc-component-types.mjs`, the first dimension, and it stays
 *      its own gate: it needs no install and no build, and it must keep running
 *      unfiltered on every docs-only PR.
 *   3. **Whether a shell example runs** (objectui#5151). A ```bash block is not
 *      read here at all.
 *
 * That list is not modesty, it is the point. objectui#5138 measured what a gate
 * with an unstated blind spot does: `check-doc-component-types` verified the
 * `type` literals `summary` / `matrix` / `joined` — which were correct — while
 * four separate falsehoods sat beside them in the same snippets (`objectName` and
 * `groupingsDown`, keys the strict `ReportSchema` rejects; `columns:
 * [{ field, aggregate }]`, a key repurposed to `string[]`; `import type
 * { ReportInput }`, a type the spec does not export; and `registerDrillHandler`,
 * a fabricated export). Three gates were green on that prose for the whole
 * interval. The card's sentence for it:
 *
 *     The gate looked at the one key that was correct.
 *
 * A gate that checks the one thing that is right converts "unverified" into a
 * green, which is worse than no gate. So this file states its edges out loud, and
 * the ledger below states, by name, every document it does not read.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all: it is consolidation, not new capability
 *
 * The harness had already been hand-rolled three times, each time privately, each
 * time finding defects its reviewer had not listed:
 *
 *   objectui#5053  README export-surface probe — proved the name set had to come
 *                  from the package's EXPORTS, not from a grep of `src/`
 *                  (`ReportScheduleConfig` appears twice in `src/` and is not
 *                  exported; a grep-based check calls it real).
 *   objectui#5060  README signature probe — extracted the blocks BY SCRIPT rather
 *                  than by hand, and carried a wiring self-check (deliberately
 *                  swap two arguments; the probe must go red) so a silently-`any`
 *                  program could not pass as green.
 *   objectui#5047  the two plugin-report documents — compiled against the built
 *                  `dist/index.d.ts` with a resolution self-check proving it, and
 *                  a planted `ThisNameIsDefinitelyNotExported` sentinel.
 *
 * All three practices are kept here (see "Controls"). One practice is
 * deliberately NOT kept: #5047's first run was a FALSE GREEN, and the mechanism
 * is the most important thing this file inherits — see "Syntax is not semantics".
 *
 * ## The rule for fragments: explicit marker, never a silent skip
 *
 * Documentation legitimately contains partial snippets. The rule this gate uses,
 * stated rather than inferred:
 *
 *     EVERY `ts` / `tsx` fenced block in a covered document is compiled, in
 *     ISOLATION, as its own module. A block that is not meant to compile must be
 *     DECLARED by a marker line immediately above its fence, carrying a written
 *     reason. There is no third case: a block that fails to parse is a FAILURE,
 *     never a skip.
 *
 * Two kinds of block need the declaration, and the reason says which: a genuine
 * FRAGMENT (a shape excerpt, a block continuing the one above it, a call into
 * the host's own router), and a block that is deliberately about code that no
 * longer exists — a migration guide's "before" example naming a retired package
 * is correct documentation and must not compile. The marker keyword stays
 * `fragment` for both rather than growing a second vocabulary; what
 * distinguishes them is the written reason, which is the part a reviewer reads.
 *
 * The two marker spellings are quoted verbatim in `FRAGMENT_MARKER_EXAMPLES`
 * below — an MDX expression comment for `.mdx`, an HTML comment for `.md`. They
 * live in code rather than in this header because a block comment cannot quote a
 * block comment's delimiters.
 *
 * Two halves of that rule are load-bearing:
 *
 * **Never skip on failure to parse.** The tempting rule — "if it does not parse
 * it must be a fragment, skip it" — turns every real defect into a skip, silently,
 * and it degrades exactly when the docs get worse. A block nobody has declared and
 * that does not parse is reported.
 *
 * **In isolation, as its own module.** Blocks on one page are NOT compiled into a
 * shared scope, and every block with no top-level `import`/`export` has an
 * `export {}` appended so it cannot see another block's globals. This models the
 * reader, who copies ONE block: objectui#5047 found three README examples calling
 * `defineReport` with no import of their own, and fixed the documents rather than
 * the harness. A shared scope hides that whole defect class — and it hides it
 * INVISIBLY, because the page still reads fine to a human going top to bottom.
 *
 * **A fragment's reason says why it cannot compile. It never claims the block was
 * checked** (objectui#7505). A DECLARED fragment is the one thing this gate does
 * not compile, so a reason asserting the block agrees with some shipped artifact
 * is an assertion the gate structurally cannot re-verify — and a reader has no
 * way to tell the two apart, because both arrive in the same marker. Measured:
 * `content/docs/utilities/data-objectstack.mdx` declared a signature excerpt
 * "checked against the shipped `dist/index.d.ts` … with the same type". The
 * claim was TRUE when written and went silently false when objectui#7503 widened
 * the factory's return from `DataSource<T>` to `ObjectStackAdapter<T>`. Three
 * independent readers looked for exactly that falsehood and did not find it —
 * card objectui#7323 never listed the page, the implementer reported "no
 * swappability note anywhere" after searching, and the seat that briefed the
 * search accepted that. The failure was not diligence: the page reads as
 * verified and nothing contradicts it. That makes the marked page WORSE than an
 * unmarked one, because it converts a reader's correct instinct — go check this
 * against the source — into a step they skip.
 *
 * The reusable rule, which is why this is worth a gate and not a convention:
 *
 *     A claim that something was verified is only as good as the check that
 *     re-verifies it on every commit. A one-time verification written into prose
 *     is a fact with an expiry date and no alarm.
 *
 * So `VERIFICATION_CLAIM` below refuses the COMBINATION, never the exemption:
 * exempting a fragment from compilation stays a legitimate declaration, and a
 * verification claim stays legitimate on a block this gate actually compiles.
 * Only the two together are refused, and the author has two ways out — say why
 * the block cannot compile without asserting it was checked, or move the block
 * into the compiled tier where the claim becomes one this gate re-verifies. ⛔
 * Not an option: adding an exemption list. An exemption here would be a second
 * unverifiable assertion about an unverifiable assertion.
 *
 * The verb set is deliberately small and it is a closed list, because a census
 * of this corpus showed it can be: of 158 declared fragments, exactly 2 carried
 * a claim, and both spelled it `verified` / `hand-checked`. `type-check` is
 * excluded on purpose — it names THIS gate's own action, so "type-checked on the
 * complete example at the end of the page" (content/docs/guide/component-registry.md)
 * is a claim about a check that does re-run on every commit, which is the shape
 * this rule wants, not the shape it refuses. ⚠️ Stated limit: the check reads the
 * marker's reason, not the page's prose, and it matches verbs rather than parsing
 * meaning — "type-checked by hand" would pass it. It closes the spelling that has
 * actually been written here, and it turns a silent gap into a red build on the
 * commit that reintroduces it.
 *
 * ## Syntax is not semantics — the false-green mechanism this gate is built around
 *
 * objectui#5047 measured it, and it nearly cost that review its result: `tsc`
 * reports syntactic diagnostics and, IF THERE ARE ANY, never reports semantic
 * ones — program-wide, not per-file. Two prose fragments with a bare
 * `filter: { ... }` line produced five parse errors and ZERO semantic
 * diagnostics, over a program whose whole purpose was the semantic half. The run
 * was red, so it read as "the check works" while proving nothing at all about
 * every other block in it.
 *
 * Three consequences, all of them structural here rather than advisory:
 *
 *   - The two phases are SEPARATE. Blocks are parsed one at a time first;
 *     anything with a parse error is reported as a `syntax` failure and is kept
 *     OUT of the semantic program, so one unparseable block cannot blind the
 *     rest.
 *   - Every failure line is tagged `[syntax]` or `[semantic]`, and the summary
 *     always prints the semantic COVERAGE — how many blocks the semantic phase
 *     actually judged, out of how many exist. A syntax-only red therefore cannot
 *     be read as a semantic pass, and a semantic green cannot be read as covering
 *     blocks that never reached the checker.
 *   - When any block fails to parse, the summary says so in the same breath as
 *     the semantic result, in words.
 *
 * ## Controls — a probe that cannot fail is not a probe
 *
 * Three run on every invocation, before any verdict about the documents:
 *
 *   RESOLUTION  `@object-ui/types` is resolved through the same host the program
 *               uses, and the resolved path is PRINTED. It must land in a
 *               `dist/` `.d.ts`. The repository's own root `tsconfig.json` maps
 *               `@object-ui/<name>` to each package's `src`, so a harness that inherited
 *               it would silently check the docs against SOURCE — green while the
 *               published surface is broken. Nothing here extends that config,
 *               and every source file the program loads is checked not to live
 *               under a package's `src/`.
 *   SENTINEL    a synthetic module importing `ThisNameIsDefinitelyNotExported`
 *               from a real package MUST produce TS2305. A probe that silently
 *               resolves everything to `any` reports green forever; this is the
 *               only thing that can tell the two apart.
 *   POSITIVE    a synthetic module importing a real symbol MUST be clean. Without
 *               it, a harness broken in the other direction (wrong `lib`, missing
 *               types, unbuilt tree) turns every document red at once and reads
 *               as "the docs are full of defects".
 *
 *   UNDECLARED  a synthetic module importing `@floating-ui/react-dom` MUST produce
 *               TS2307. That package IS installed in this workspace — Radix's
 *               popper pulls it in, under `@object-ui/components`'s declared
 *               `@radix-ui/react-popover` — and NO package a covered document
 *               imports declares it, so no reader of the documented packages can
 *               import it either. It is the control on the third-party rule
 *               below: the moment resolution widens past what the imported
 *               packages declare, this control goes green and the gate has become
 *               a rubber stamp no snippet can fail — invisibly, because every
 *               document stays green while it happens. It also fails loudly if
 *               the specifier ever BECOMES a declared dependency (pick another),
 *               or is not installed at all (a specifier that resolves nowhere
 *               proves nothing about how far resolution reaches).
 *
 *   ROOT-       a synthetic module importing `vitest` MUST produce TS2307.
 *   DECLARED    `vitest` is declared by this repository's ROOT `package.json`,
 *               which pnpm symlinks into `/node_modules`, so it USED to resolve
 *               here and now must not — it is the control on the bound stated
 *               in the next section. Its three failure modes are the UNDECLARED
 *               control's, for the same reasons: the specifier becoming mapped
 *               (pick another), the specifier no longer being declared by the
 *               root (it then proves nothing about the root's set), and the
 *               specifier not being installed (a specifier that resolves
 *               nowhere anyway proves nothing about how far resolution reaches).
 *
 * ## The bound: what the repository ROOT declares does not resolve either
 *
 * The rule in the next section maps what the IMPORTED PACKAGES declare. Nothing
 * in it says anything about the repository's own `package.json` — and under pnpm
 * the root's own dependency set IS symlinked into `/node_modules`, one directory
 * above where every block is compiled. So a bare specifier that neither map
 * covers still resolved, as long as this repository happened to declare it as a
 * devDependency: measured, `vitest` and `@playwright/test`. A snippet importing
 * one was green because of what THIS WORKSPACE installs to test itself, which is
 * not a claim about anything its reader installs. The UNDECLARED control does
 * not reach this: it bounds TRANSITIVE packages (which pnpm leaves only under
 * `.pnpm/`, unreachable from here), a different leak.
 *
 *     A bare specifier that resolves ONLY through the repository root's own
 *     manifest is REFUSED, in this harness, for every consumer of it.
 *
 * Ruled by the maintainer on 2026-09-03 (objectstack#14909 item 1, option A;
 * objectui#7463 item 2) after the objectui#7490 flight measured both halves. ⛔
 * What it is deliberately NOT: a parameter defaulting to off. Two resolution
 * regimes behind one function would answer "did resolution stay narrow?" with
 * "depends who is asking", which is the consumer-side tolerance this whole file
 * is built against. There is one regime, and the control above proves it is on.
 *
 * ONE predicate (`resolvesOnlyThroughRootManifest`), enforced at two points
 * because a bound needs to be both TOTAL and ATTRIBUTABLE:
 *
 *   - **In the resolver** (`host.resolveModuleNames`, for files inside the
 *     virtual probe directory only — the bound is about what a SNIPPET may
 *     import, never about how a `.d.ts` deep in `node_modules` resolves its own
 *     imports). This is the regime, and the ROOT-DECLARED control is exactly the
 *     probe that it is live.
 *   - **Per block** (from the parsed AST, never a regex — the corpus is prose,
 *     and a specifier-shaped string in a template literal is not an import). A
 *     block importing such a specifier is kept OUT of the semantic program and
 *     reported as its own failure class, the way an unparseable block is: its
 *     other diagnostics would be noise cascading off an import that resolves
 *     nowhere, and the summary's coverage count then tells the truth about what
 *     was judged instead of counting it as checked.
 *
 * The manifest, not the disk, decides — the same direction as "declared, never
 * merely installed" below. A specifier the root declares AND a mapped package
 * declares is mapped, and stays resolvable: it reaches the reader through the
 * package they install, so the root's copy is not what backs it.
 *
 * ONE exemption, and it is about authorship rather than about resolution: the
 * JSX factory module (`react/jsx-runtime`). It is the only module the compiler
 * imports on the author's behalf — see `JSX_RUNTIME_SPECIFIERS` for the measured
 * reason, which is that refusing it would red blocks over a line nobody wrote,
 * unevenly between the two corpora.
 *
 * ⛔ What this rule exists INSTEAD of, again: adding `@playwright/test` to some
 * package's `dependencies` so the map covers it. See the 2026-08-24 ruling
 * quoted at the end of the next section — a manifest is a claim about what a
 * package needs, and a doc gate's convenience is not that claim.
 *
 * ## Third-party specifiers resolve exactly as far as the imported packages declare
 *
 * A snippet that imports `@object-ui/layout` may also import `lucide-react`,
 * because `@object-ui/layout` DECLARES `lucide-react`: a reader who installs that
 * package gets it in their `node_modules`, and `SidebarNav`'s `NavItem.icon`
 * genuinely takes a lucide icon. This program compiles every block at the
 * repository ROOT, where under pnpm a workspace package's own dependency is not
 * hoisted and so does not resolve — five correct blocks across
 * `content/docs/layout` failed TS2307 on nothing but that (objectui#6120). The
 * snippets were right; the resolution environment was the gap.
 *
 * The rule, stated here because its EDGES are the whole of its value:
 *
 *     For every workspace package a COVERED document imports, each specifier that
 *     package declares in its own `dependencies` is mapped to the types a
 *     consumer of that package would resolve — resolved from inside that
 *     package's own directory, exactly the way that package's own code resolves
 *     it.
 *
 * Four edges, each deliberate:
 *
 *   - **Declared, never merely installed.** The set comes from `dependencies` in
 *     the imported packages' manifests, never from a walk of `node_modules`. A
 *     blanket mapping would let a snippet import a transitive package no consumer
 *     can reach and still pass green, which is strictly worse than the gap it
 *     would close: the gate's whole value is that it fails where a reader fails.
 *   - **`dependencies` only** — not `peerDependencies`, not `devDependencies`. A
 *     dependency is what the package installs FOR its consumer; a peer is a
 *     requirement ON the consumer that may be unmet; a devDependency reaches no
 *     consumer at all. A snippet importing a peer therefore still fails here.
 *     That is the conservative direction on purpose: this rule fails CLOSED, and
 *     widening it later is a visible edit with a reason, not a silent drift.
 *   - **Imported packages only.** A package no covered document imports
 *     contributes nothing, so this map grows only as coverage grows — the same
 *     property `--build-filter` has, for the same reason.
 *   - **The bare specifier only, no subpath wildcard.** `lucide-react` is mapped;
 *     `lucide-react/dynamic` is not, and fails closed. Mapping `<pkg>/*` would
 *     reach past the package's own `exports`, and `exports` is precisely the
 *     boundary a reader hits.
 *
 * ⛔ What this rule exists INSTEAD of: declaring `lucide-react` at the repository
 * root. That would put an entry in this repository's dependency graph that exists
 * only to make a checker pass — changing what the repo claims to need in order to
 * satisfy a tool. The 2026-08-24 ruling on objectui#6120 rejected that route by
 * name, alongside objectui#5329 (minting a `$schema` URL because prose named one)
 * and objectui#6107 (minting exports because docs imported them). A manifest is a
 * claim about what a package needs; a doc gate's convenience is not that claim.
 *
 * ## Coverage is declared, never assumed — and the scan surface is stated here
 *
 * A document is covered unless it is named in `UNGATED_DOCS` with a reason. The
 * default is therefore COVERED: a new page is compiled from the day it lands,
 * and opting one out is an edit a reviewer can see. Entries are re-derived every
 * run — an entry naming a file that does not exist, or that holds no `ts` / `tsx`
 * block at all, fails as a stale entry, so the list can only shrink.
 *
 * That rule is only true of documents the walk actually reaches, so the SCAN
 * SURFACE is stated in the same breath as the coverage rule rather than left to
 * be read off the collector:
 *
 *     every `.mdx` and `.md` page under `content/docs`, every
 *     `packages/<name>/README.md`, every `.md` / `.mdx` page at the TOP LEVEL of
 *     the repository-root `docs/` tree (objectui#7856 card 1 — not its
 *     subdirectories), and the root `README.md`.
 *
 * Stating it here is objectui#5174's finding, and the finding was not the missing
 * extension — it was that a reader had to open `listDocuments` to learn that
 * "covered by default" meant "covered if the filename ends in `.mdx`". The
 * collector admitted 143 `.mdx` under `content/docs` and silently excluded 40
 * `.md` guides — the getting-started pages a reader copies from most. None of
 * them was in the ledger, so they were neither covered NOR declared ungated:
 * they were invisible to this gate's own accounting, and the summary line below
 * could not mention them. That is precisely the silent skip the fragment rule
 * exists to prevent, arriving one level up, at the document instead of the block.
 * Anything added to the scan surface later belongs in that list, on the same day.
 *
 * ⚠️ The honest limit, stated because a reader of a green run needs it: an
 * ungated document is NOT compiled and NOT counted. Its snippets are unverified,
 * exactly as they were before this gate existed. The ledger is a debt list with
 * names, not a coverage claim. It carries no per-file failure count on purpose:
 * a count would have to be produced by compiling every ungated document, which
 * means building every package in the workspace on every run — the per-PR
 * full-repo build the 2026-08-16 ruling on objectui#4846 rejected (see
 * `.github/workflows/published-dist-gate.yml`). The build here is scoped to the
 * packages the COVERED documents import, which is why `--build-filter` exists and
 * why the cost grows only as coverage grows.

 * `check-doc-component-types`, and not `lint:root`, whose script literally passes
 * `--ignore-pattern 'docs/**'`. Three phantom-teaching sites (objectui#7838,
 * objectui#7854) were found in it by hand, which is the only instrument that was
 * ever pointed at it.
 *
 * `recursive: false` is the whole design of this leg, and it is a boundary rather
 * than an optimisation. The tree's SUBDIRECTORIES are a different review route:
 * `docs/adr/**` is a GOVERNED surface (`GOVERNED_SURFACES` id `adr` in
 * `check-governed-queue-guard.mjs`, so a pull request touching it stops in draft
 * for a human to merge) and `docs/audits/**` travels with it as objectui#7856's

 * fix (26 + 3, as objectui#7856 measured them on `8507a2283`) — which is how a
 * widening turns into a change nobody can land. The same
 * reasoning, in the same words, as `APP_DOCS`' "one level of app directory and no
 * deeper": a scan surface says where it stops.
 *
 * So the enumeration below is by DIRECTORY ENTRY and filtered to FILES. Adding
 * `docs/adr/**` later is then an edit to this file that a reviewer sees, never a
 * side effect of a page being moved into a subdirectory.
 *
 * Exported — the constant and the enumerator both — so a sibling census can ask
 * this gate what its leg contains instead of re-spelling it. That is what
 * `check-doc-fence-languages.test.ts` does: `check-doc-fence-languages` does NOT
 * carry this leg (its walk is `check:doc-fences`' own surface, and moving it is

 *
 * Stated once, here, because this gate has the widest surface and holds the

 * at this block.
 *
 *   root                        fences · snippets · types
 *   ─────────────────────────── ─────────────────────────

 *   apps/<app>/docs/**              ✓        ✓       ✓     objectui#6600

 *   docs/*.md (top level only)      ✗        ✓       ✗     objectui#7856 card 1
 *
 * The `docs/*.md` row is the one leg THIS gate carries alone, and the asymmetry
 * is deliberate rather than an oversight to be tidied up later: objectui#7856
 * card 1 moves this gate's population only, so `check-doc-fence-languages` and
 * `check-doc-component-types` keep the surface they had. `check-doc-fence-
 * languages.test.ts` therefore no longer compares the two walks for equality
 * flat — it subtracts exactly `rootDocsPages()` and compares the rest, so the
 * divergence is named and bounded instead of being a list that silently drifted.
 * ⛔ The subdirectories are NOT this row: `docs/adr/**` is governed and
 * `docs/audits/**` travels with it (objectui#7856 card 2).
 *
 * `check-doc-component-types` does not read the package READMEs — it asks
 * whether a documented `type` literal is a registered component key, and a
 * package README teaches its own package's API rather than the schema vocabulary.
 * That is the ONE deliberate asymmetry, and it is why that gate cannot join the
 * document-list equality pin the other two share.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERYTHING ELSE authored in markdown is read by no doc gate at all. That is
 * a statement of what the roots are today, ⛔ not a plan and not a promise. In
 * descending order of size, the unscanned population is: non-README `.md` under
 * `packages/**` (by far the largest); `docs/adr/**` and `docs/audits/**` — the
 * root `docs/` tree BELOW its top level, which objectui#7856 card 2 holds and
 * card 1 deliberately left where it was; the PUBLISHED
 * `skills/objectui/**`; the root pages that are not `README.md` (`AGENTS.md`,
 * `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and the rest); `examples/**`; the `apps/**`
 * pages that are not under an `apps/<app>/docs/` tree; `.claude/**`;
 * `.github/**`; and `patches/**`. The ephemeral `.changeset/` is excluded as
 * noise rather than counted as debt.
 *
 * ⛔ Deliberately NO count is written here, neither a total nor a per-tree one.
 * That is not laziness, it is objectui#7448's defect avoided at the source: a
 * hand-copied number in a header drifts from the tree and nothing fails when it
 * does, which is the same lesson `UNGATED_DOCS`'s own header records after both
 * halves of its `12 .mdx pages and 32 package READMEs` went stale ("a pointer to
 * the list now rather than a copy of its length"). The first draft of THIS block
 * proved the point inside a single pull request: it said 114, counting the three
 * `apps/<app>/docs/` guides that the very same change was bringing under the
 * gates.
 * The command below is the durable answer, and it answers both "how many" and
 * "which":
 *
 *     git ls-files '*.md' '*.mdx' \
 *       | grep -vE '^(content/docs/|apps/[^/]+/docs/|packages/[^/]+/README\.md$|README\.md$|docs/[^/]+\.mdx?$|\.changeset/)'
 *
 * ⛔ `skills/objectui/**` is NOT claimed by any gate here, and this line is the
 * opposite of a claim on it: it is a governed, published surface with its own
 * review path, so pointing a doc gate at it is a decision for whoever owns that
 * surface — never a side effect of a root move. Writing an unscanned tree down
 * is what keeps it a KNOWN debt; a tree nobody names is objectui#5174's
 * "neither covered NOR declared ungated", which is strictly worse.
 *
 * Documents whose snippets are NOT compiled, each with the reason. The default
 * is covered; this list is the debt, by name, and it can only shrink.
 *
 * ⚠️ ZERO of these entries are now `.md` pages under `content/docs`. There were 19
 * when objectui#5174 made them visible — the collector reads `.md`, and an entry
 * with a measured reason is what a page that cannot pass yet is owed — and that
 * card then walked every one of them back OFF this list rather than re-wording its
 * reason. The direction on that card was entries LEAVING, and it finished: what
 * remains here is `.mdx` pages under `content/docs` plus package READMEs, and the
 * ENTRIES BELOW are that list — re-derived every run and shrink-only, so the names
 * in it are the count. This sentence carried the literal `12 .mdx pages and 32
 * package READMEs` until objectui#5174's batch 7, by which point BOTH halves had
 * drifted: the README count has been 31 since objectui#5259, and the `.mdx` count
 * moves with every batch. Nothing fails on a stale number written here, which is
 * why it is a pointer to the list now rather than a copy of its length.
 *
 * Batch 1 took ten: `api/schema-reference`, `plugins/index`, and the `guide/` pages
 * `architecture-overview`, `deployment`, `expressions`, `notifications`,
 * `public-forms`, `schema-overview`, `troubleshooting` and `user-state-persistence`
 * — clearing 90 diagnostics. Batch 2 took four more — `guide/plugins`,
 * `guide/building-crud-app`, `rfcs/0001-clipboard-paste` and `guide/architecture`
 * — clearing 89. Batch 3 took three — `guide/plugin-development`,
 * `guide/schema-rendering` and `guide/theming` — clearing 81. Batch 4 took the
 * final pair, `guide/component-registry` (59) and `guide/layout` (45), clearing
 * 104. Each page reached zero the honest two ways — a block
 * that should compile was made self-contained against the built `dist/`, and a
 * block that genuinely cannot compile got a `FRAGMENT_MARKER` declaration with a
 * written reason. Nothing about this gate's strictness moved to get them there.
 *
 * Batch 4 in the same terms as the batches below: 32 blocks brought under the gate
 * — 23 declared fragments and 9 that compile, of which 5 already compiled untouched
 * and 4 were edited to. Its defect was in the page's ONE complete copy-paste
 * example: `guide/component-registry`'s `RatingComponent` calls `useState` while
 * importing only `forwardRef` from `react`, so the block a reader is invited to
 * take whole was broken at the first hook. The same block took `cn` from the
 * reader's own `@/lib/utils` alias when `@object-ui/components` exports `cn`
 * itself. Two things this gate CANNOT see on that page, stated because a green run
 * must not be read as more than it is: `ComponentRegistry` is a `Registry<any>`, so
 * `register()`'s component argument is `any` and no registered component's props
 * are checked against what `SchemaRenderer` passes; and `BaseSchema` carries
 * `[key: string]: any`, so a wrong key on a `BaseSchema`-shaped literal is
 * structurally invisible here. What IS sealed — and therefore really checked —
 * is `ComponentMeta`, `ComponentInput`, `NavItem`, `NavGroup`, `AppShellProps` and
 * `SidebarNavProps`; every literal of those six on the two pages was measured
 * clean, the `lucide-react` blocks by probing them with the icon import shimmed
 * rather than by inferring it from the TS2307 that hid them.
 *
 * Batch 2's two routes in proportion, because the ratio is the reviewable part: it
 * brought 42 blocks under the gate — 34 declared fragments and 8 that compile, of
 * which 4 already compiled untouched and 4 were edited to. Three of those four
 * edits were genuine documented-API defects the ledger had been hiding, and they
 * are why a page like `guide/architecture` was worth covering rather than
 * declaring wholesale: `building-crud-app`'s REST adapter
 * passed `QueryParams['$orderby']` — a four-shape union — straight into
 * `URLSearchParams.set`, which takes a string; its `TaskDetail` component used
 * `SchemaRenderer` with no import of its own; and `guide/architecture`'s section
 * titled "Type Safety", marked `// ✅ Type-checked`, set `ButtonSchema.onClick` to
 * the STRING `'handleClick'` where the declared type is `() => void | Promise<void>`.
 * The pages that are mostly fragments are mostly fragments for a stated reason:
 * Batch 3 in the same terms: 38 blocks brought under the gate — 26 declared
 * fragments and 12 that compile, of which 7 already compiled untouched and 5 were
 * edited to. Its defect was the largest single one this card has surfaced, and it
 * was hidden the way objectui#5138 describes: `guide/theming`'s three `Theme`
 * objects were annotated `Theme` but the annotation itself errored (`Theme` was
 * never imported in two of them), so TypeScript never excess-checked the literals
 * underneath. With the annotation resolving, the `brand` palette alone had TEN of
 * its fourteen `colors` keys off `ColorPalette` — `"primary-foreground"`,
 * `foreground`, `muted`, `ring`, `destructive` and the other `*-foreground` pairs
 * are Shadcn CSS VARIABLE names, not palette keys — plus `radius` and `fonts`,
 * neither of which is a `Theme` key, and no `label`, which is required. Every one
 * of those is dropped in silence at runtime: `generateColorVars` iterates
 * `COLOR_TO_CSS_MAP`, so it can only ever emit the keys `ColorPalette` declares.
 * The pages were teaching theme JSON most of which the engine ignores. The fix
 * routes them through the two doors that do work — the real palette keys, each
 * annotated with the variable it emits, and `customVars` for the rest, which the
 * engine emits verbatim as `--<key>: <value>`.
 *
 * `guide/plugin-development` also had the documented Vitest example asserting
 * `toBeInTheDocument()` with no `@testing-library/jest-dom` import, the matcher's
 * own package — a reader copying that test got neither the types nor the matcher.
 *
 * The pages that are mostly fragments are mostly fragments for a stated reason:
 * `guide/plugin-development` walks the reader through building a plugin package,
 * so its blocks import `./types` and `./BoardImpl` — files the reader has just
 * been told to write — and `guide/theming` quotes the published `Badge` source,
 * which imports `class-variance-authority`, a peer that resolves in the reader's
 * app but is not a root dependency here.
 * `guide/plugins` and the clipboard-paste RFC document packages the reader is being
 * taught to create, and an RFC's signature excerpts have no bodies by design.
 * `guide/layout` is the same shape as `guide/theming`, one layer out: four of its
 * nine blocks import `lucide-react` for the icon COMPONENTS `NavItem.icon` takes,
 * and that package — a dependency of ten workspace packages here, including
 * `@object-ui/layout` — is not a root dependency, so the specifier does not resolve
 * in this program. Hoisting a package to the repo root to buy a doc snippet
 * coverage is a real dependency edge, so those blocks are declared instead, with
 * what sits underneath them measured (via a shimmed icon import) rather than left
 * unknown. `guide/component-registry`'s six category lists were markdown BULLET
 * LISTS inside `tsx` fences — the fence language was the defect there rather
 * than anything in the blocks, so they were declared here and left to their own
 * change. objectui#5997 (PR #6056) then made that change: the six fences are
 * plain markdown bullet lists on the page now, which takes those blocks out of
 * the ts/tsx population this gate collects at all, so the six `FRAGMENT_MARKER`
 * declarations came out with them — a marker on a block the gate no longer
 * collects is debt nothing would ever fail to prompt the removal of. The entry
 * stays here because this ledger keeps the record of why each declaration
 * existed, not because the page still carries them.
 *
 * objectui#5343 then read that list back and cleared it for the getting-started
 * pages: no entry for `content/docs/guide/**` or for
 * `content/docs/api/schema-reference.md` names a missing export any more. Every
 * symbol those pages documented now exists on the built `dist/index.d.ts`, so
 * their reasons record what each fabricated name BECAME instead. objectui#5360
 * then closed out the last one. `content/docs/utilities/index.md` named
 * `ObjectStackProvider` (@object-ui/data-objectstack) — a React context provider
 * on a package that is headless — and that page LEFT this ledger rather than
 * getting a re-measured reason: it holds exactly ONE ts/tsx block, so rewriting
 * that block against the real surface (`createObjectStackAdapter` injected
 * through `@object-ui/react`'s `SchemaRendererProvider`, the shape PR #4129 had
 * already established on the sibling `content/docs/utilities/data-objectstack.mdx`)
 * retired the two undefined-name diagnostics in the same stroke and took the page
 * to zero. No entry on this list names a missing export any more.
 *
 * The reasons are deliberately concrete about WHAT would have to change, because
 * "does not compile" is three different jobs: a page whose snippets reference
 * ambient names it never defines needs the blocks made self-contained (or
 * declared fragments); a page whose ```ts fences hold bare object literals needs
 * the fence language corrected to `json`; a page whose snippets are genuinely
 * wrong needs the documented API fixed. Only the third is a defect this gate
 * would report, and telling them apart is per-page work.
 *

// ── Emitted-code census: what a generator WRITES into someone else's file ────

/**
 * A generator that emits `import` statements is a documentation surface, and
 * nothing compiles it (objectui#7864).
 *
 * Code a generator emits from a template literal under `packages/NAME/src/**` is
 * read by nothing: `tsc` sees a STRING, `tsup` copies it through, and every doc
 * gate's scan surface — this one's `listDocuments()` included — stops at
 * `content/docs`, the per-app docs trees and the package READMEs. The class has
 * two known members. `packages/vscode-extension/src/extension.ts`'s
 * `generateReactComponent()` emitted a phantom `registerDefaultRenderers`
 * import into every file the *Export to React* command ever wrote for a user
 * (fixed by PR objectui#7863, measured there as `tsc` exit 2 / TS2305 on the
 * emitted file); `packages/cli/src/utils/app-generator.ts` is objectui#7472,
 * still open and still unfixed.
 *
 * ⭐ REPORT-ONLY, and the CENSUS is the deliverable. The card's binding
 * constraint, and the same posture `check-doc-expression-carriage.mjs` landed
 * under: objectui#7472's site is a KNOWN UNFIXED member, so a blocking gate on
 * first landing would go red on somebody else's card and turn one card into
 * two. What the population is — how many code-emitting templates exist, how
 * many diagnostics they produce, and how they split by package — is what
 * decides clean-the-corpus versus build-a-ledger, and ⛔ this file does not
 * make that decision.
 *
 * Report-only means it declines to fail on its FINDINGS, never that it passes
 * without looking (objectstack#4928, objectui#4690). A failed harness control,
 * an unbuilt closure or a walk that collapsed is the gate's own
 * `EXIT_CODES.couldNotRun`, loudly — a check that runs, goes green and looked
 * at nothing is the counterfeit this whole file is built against.
 *
 * ## The recogniser: the static heuristic, with the marker kept as its escape
 *
 * Ruling: compile a template only when something says it is code. Three routes
 * were priced.
 *
 *   HEURISTIC  a template whose text contains an `import … from '…'` statement.
 *              Sees the whole class without anybody opting in; can MISFIRE, and
 *              on this corpus it does — `packages/create-plugin/src/templates.ts`
 *              emits a README whose ```tsx fence carries an import, and emits
 *              vite configs importing `vite` and `@vitejs/plugin-react`, which
 *              no documented package declares. Under report-only a misfire
 *              costs a reported line, never a red build.
 *   MARKER     an opt-in comment on the template. Cannot see an unmarked
 *              emitter — and that is disqualifying HERE, not merely weaker:
 *              this card may not touch `app-generator.ts` (objectui#7472 is on
 *              hold), so under a marker route the one site the ruling requires
 *              the census to show RED could not be marked at all, and the
 *              census would report one site and zero diagnostics. A census that
 *              cannot see the member it was filed for measures nothing.
 *   PATH LIST  a hand-kept list of emitting files. Rots silently in the
 *              direction that produces a green over a file nobody added.
 *
 * ⇒ The heuristic is the recogniser. The marker is kept and HONOURED as its
 * escape hatch — a template the heuristic cannot see (it emits a module that
 * imports nothing, or builds its import line out of holes) is opted in by one
 * comment, and the census reports how many templates arrive that way. Kept, and
 * honoured, rather than merely counted: a marker the gate reads and does not
 * act on is a declaration the runtime does not cash, which is the shape
 * AGENTS.md commandment #0.1 refuses. It carries ONE vocabulary with the
 * fragment marker above — `doc-snippet:` — because a second spelling of the
 * same idea is the thing readers stop being able to keep straight.
 *
 * The blind side is reported rather than assumed, every run, because a census
 * that cannot see what it excludes is not a census: the marker population (what
 * the opt-in route alone would have reached) and the count of unrecognised
 * templates that open a top-level `export` (what NEITHER route sees today) are
 * both printed beside the recognised count.
 *
 * ## `${…}` holes, and the one transformation this makes
 *
 * A template's holes are substituted by the placeholder identifier
 * `EMITTED_HOLE_PLACEHOLDER`, and a body that had any gets ONE appended line
 * declaring it. Both halves are load-bearing and both are stated because the
 * snippet compiled is then not byte-identical to what the generator writes:
 *
 *   - The placeholder is an IDENTIFIER because the corpus interpolates in
 *     identifier position as often as in expression position — this repository's
 *     generators write `${vars.pascalName}Plugin` and `const schema =
 *     ${schemaJson};` in the same breath. An expression-shaped placeholder
 *     (`null`, `0 as any`) is a syntax error in the first; an identifier is
 *     legal in both.
 *   - The declaration is APPENDED, never prepended, so every diagnostic's line
 *     number still points at the real source line. `var`, not `const`: a
 *     block-scoped declaration read above its own line is TS2448, which would
 *     be a diagnostic this instrument invented.
 *
 * What the substitution therefore cannot judge, said out loud: whether the
 * VALUE a hole interpolates type-checks where it lands. This census answers
 * only whether the code AROUND the holes does.
 *
 * ## Where it walks
 *
 * `packages/NAME/src/**` — `.ts` and `.tsx` — minus `TOOLING_FILE`, imported from
 * `check-phantom-dependencies.mjs` rather than copied, so tests, mocks,
 * benchmarks and stories drop out by the same rule that file already enforces.
 * The excluded population is COUNTED and printed: a member hiding in a test
 * fixture is a different fact from no member at all.
 *
 * Each recognised template is then compiled through `compileSnippets()` — the
 * same call, the same built `.d.ts` closure, the same root bound, the same
 * controls — so an emitted snippet is judged EXACTLY the way a documentation
 * block is. That is the whole argument for putting this here instead of in a
 * per-package test: the harness already exists, and route B would have bought
 * one template at the cost of real `devDependencies` in a package that builds
 * in 23 ms (objectui#7864's own table).

 *                   placeholder: the emitted import TARGET is itself
 *                   interpolated, so there is no specifier for any compiler to

 *                   `./index.css`, `./theme-provider`, `./Layout` are files the

 * buildable unit: a package the docs import pulls in workspace packages no
 * snippet ever names, and those still have to be built before the imported one

 *     bare list and the `...` list select the IDENTICAL 33 tasks, so the suffix
 *     changes nothing for the workflow that consumes this — it is a no-op where
 *     the closure was already right.
 *   - `pnpm <args> run build` did NOT, because pnpm's `--filter` selects exactly
 *     what it matches and runs each package's own script. Measured on this tree:
 *     21 packages selected instead of 33, and the build died at
 *     `ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_RUN_FIRST_FAIL @object-ui/components` on
 *     `TS2307: Cannot find module '@object-ui/sdui-parser'` — a workspace
 *     package no snippet imports, so nothing put it in the list.
 *
 * Both spellings wear the same `--filter=` flag, so which one closes the gap was
 * invisible at the point of use. Carrying the closure in the emitted list makes
 * the answer independent of the tool the reader reaches for, which matters most
 * for the reader who is here because the gate just told them to build something.
