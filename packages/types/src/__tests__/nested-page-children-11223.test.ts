/**
 * objectui#11223 — a component nested in a `page:` container's props bag is
 * judged, on both faces, at the positions `@objectstack/spec`'s page walk
 * descends.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The containers take their child lists in the bag (`properties.children`;
 * `properties.items[].children` on `page:tabs` / `page:accordion`), and the
 * spec rows the arms read by reference type every one of those slots
 * `z.array(z.unknown())`. So `safeValidateSchema` (what `objectui validate`
 * runs) and `StrictAnyComponentSchema` passed a malformed nested block, and a
 * nested `type` no arm declares, while the same child in a node-level child
 * slot was refused. Every row in (a) below parsed green on both faces before
 * this card; the last row of (b) is the node-level slot that already judged.
 *
 * ## What each block pins
 *
 *   (a) the refusals: every container, a malformed child and an unknown nested
 *       `type`, both faces, each issue at the child's real path;
 *   (b) the controls: valid nested pages parse on both faces, and the nesting
 *       is judged at every depth and through a node-level child slot;
 *   (c) the strict face judges a nested component STRICTLY — the check is
 *       re-pointed at the strict twin, not copied pointing at the tolerant one;
 *   (d) parity: the positions are read off the installed spec's walk, here,
 *       without naming one; objectui's walk reaches every one of them, and
 *       each is a position a row of (a) judges on both faces;
 *   (e) the one slot the walks disagree on (`page:card`'s `footer`), held as a
 *       row that turns red the day the exported walk descends it;
 *   (f) a JavaScript value that nests a component inside itself still gets a
 *       verdict.
 *
 * An ablation of the check on `AnyComponentSchema` turns the refusal rows of
 * (a), (b), (c) and (f) red and nothing else — the run is recorded on the pull
 * request for objectui#11223, not re-derived here.
