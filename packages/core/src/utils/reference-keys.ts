/**
 * Backend object schemas follow the ObjectStack convention and name a
 * relational field's target object `reference`
 * (e.g. `{ type: 'lookup', reference: 'showcase_account' }`), while ObjectUI's
 * types — and most in-repo consumers — historically read `reference_to`
 * (some legacy configs also carry camelCase `referenceTo`). A consumer that
 * reads only one key silently loses the relation under the other convention:
 * the exact bug HeaderHighlight had (#2407 / PR #2587), where a served
 * `reference`-keyed lookup rendered a raw id.
 *
 * `normalizeFieldReferenceKeys` stamps BOTH snake_case keys onto the field
 * definition whenever any of the three spellings is present, so downstream
 * reads work regardless of which single key they check. It mutates the field
 * in place — the ObjectStack adapter caches the schema object and re-serves
 * it, so the one pass must stick — and is idempotent. Keys that are already
 * set are never overwritten.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Why this file also WARNS — objectui#6837 half 2
 *
 * Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-31 (第 6 场总监席决裁批 #14), 原文照录:
 *
 * > objectui不是前端的项目吗?后端的元数据只要对,前端按协议执行就行了呀
 *
 * Protocol normalization belongs on the SERVER; the front end just executes
 * the protocol. objectstack#13847 landed that half: a `field-reference-to-alias`
 * conversion rewrites stored `reference_to` → `reference` on the serve path and
 * in `os migrate meta`, so a spec-compliant backend now emits `reference` only.
 * This repo's half deleted the per-reader `reference_to` fallback arms that
 * existed to absorb the un-normalized shape.
 *
 * The ruling asked for that deletion to be AUDIBLE rather than silent, and this
 * is the cheap defence-in-depth pin it named, placed here as dispatched.
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0's `FieldSchema` is strict and refuses
 * `reference_to`, `referenceTo` and `target` by name with `unrecognized_keys`,
 * each carrying its own "did you mean → `reference`" rename (measured on the
 * installed package, with `reference` as the positive control and a nonsense
 * key as the negative one — the nonsense key gets no rename hint, so the hint
 * is alias-table membership, not boilerplate). So a def that reaches this choke
 * point spelling ONLY a legacy key came from a producer the spec would reject,
 * and the producer is where it gets fixed.
 *
 * ## ⛔ WHAT THIS WARNING DOES NOT COVER — state it, do not overclaim it
 *
 * This warning fires ONLY where this file runs, and this file runs at exactly
 * three production call sites, all of them ingestion choke points:
 *
 *   packages/app-shell/src/providers/MetadataProvider.tsx  (`ensureType`, metadata type `object`)
 *   packages/app-shell/src/providers/MetadataProvider.tsx  (`getItem`,    metadata type `object`)
 *   packages/data-objectstack/src/index.ts                 (ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema)
 *
 * All three STAMP the def, so a def that triggers this warning is also a def
 * that still resolves. ⇒ The warning fires precisely where nothing is broken.
 *
 * ⚠️ The third of those is new in objectui#7650 and the count above used to
 * read TWO. The old count was true about where this file RAN and false about
 * the serve surface it was cited for: `MetadataProvider` normalized on its
 * LIST path only, so an object def fetched BY NAME — the published
 * `useMetadataItem` hook, and any cold-cache read behind it — was served with
 * whichever single spelling the producer stored. ⛔ Do not re-derive this list
 * by grepping for the call: derive it from the serve paths that hand an object
 * schema to a reader, and check each one calls in.
 *
 * ⚠️ The BREAK surface is the complement of that: `getObjectSchema` is a
 * required member of the published `DataSource` interface and the readers call
 * it on the generic `dataSource`, so a hand-written schema served through ANY
 * other `DataSource` reaches a reader RAW — it neither passes through here nor
 * warns. On that path the failure is exactly as silent as it was before.
 * Reader-side or shared-resolver diagnostics, which would cover it, remain an
 * open question on objectui#6837 (options B and C of its table §5).
 *
 * ⛔ Do not describe this pin as making the BYO break audible. It does not.
 *
 * ⛔ The stamping itself is deliberately UNCHANGED. It is the only thing
 * standing between a BYO `DataSource` and the break, and retiring it is a
 * separate decision with its own weight — not this card's.

/**
 * ## ⭐ THE RETIRED-DIALECT ARM — objectui#7650
 *
 * The `reference` pair above is one instance of a general problem this file is
 * now the choke point for. objectui#7650 measured the shape of it:
 *
 * > The strict schema gates the WRITE door — `PUT /api/v1/meta/object/:name`
 * > refuses a document carrying an undeclared key. It does not gate the READ
 * > door.
 *
 * `ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema` fetches the object document and returns
 * it with exactly two mutations applied and NO `ObjectSchema.parse` anywhere on
 * the path. So a document stored BEFORE a key was tightened is served, verbatim,
 * to every consumer, forever — it cannot be re-saved through the strict door,
 * but nothing ever asks it to be.
 *
 * That is why "no spec-compliant producer can emit this key" and "this consumer
 * read can never fire" are DIFFERENT claims. Several retirement cards in this
 * family (objectui#7155, #7166, #7435) narrowed consumer reads to the camelCase
 * spelling on the strength of the first claim alone. This arm supplies the
 * second half for them, exactly as objectui#6837 half 2 supplied it for
 * `reference_to`: the legacy spelling is canonicalised ONCE, here, at ingestion,
 * and never at a consumer.
 *
 * ## How the fold is DERIVED, and why it is not a table
 *
 * Maintainer route ruling (2026-09-09, objectui#7650 comment 5605081157): fold
 * by the spec's OWN alias-probe rule — lowercase, strip `_`, `-` and space —
 * matched EXACTLY against `FieldSchema`'s declared key set, which this repo can
 * read off `FieldSchema.shape`.
 *
 * Two properties of that rule are the reason it was chosen over a hand-written
 * three-row table:
 *
 *   - `id_field` needs NO special case. It probes to `idfield`, which matches no
 *     declared key — `FieldSchema` has no `idField`, the spec's only `idField`
 *     sits on `InlineGridColumnSchema` — so it lands in the leave arm on its
 *     own. `title_format` likewise (no declared `titleFormat`).
 *   - A TYPO is not folded. `sortible` probes to `sortible`, which matches no
 *     declared key, so it is left alone. ⛔ This is why the spec's published
 *     `lintAuthoredRecordKeys` is NOT called here: it falls through to a
 *     Levenshtein matcher when no `to` row exists, and would answer "did you
 *     mean `sortable`?" for that typo. A serve path that silently CORRECTS a
 *     typo is worse than the defect it is fixing.
 *
 * ⚠️ "Leave arm", not "drop arm" in the destructive sense: a key this arm does
 * not fold is left on the document EXACTLY as served. Nothing here removes a
 * key or a value. Dropping the legacy key was weighed on objectui#7650 and
 * REFUSED — a stored legacy document would lose the value instead of arriving
 * canonical, and silent data loss on a serve path is the worst of the shapes.
 *
 * ⭐ The leave arm is no longer SILENT, which is the other half of that
 * sentence: the document keeps the value, and the consumers — narrowed to the
 * canonical spelling by objectui#7155 / #7166 / #7435 — read none of it. See
 * {@link warnUnfoldableRetiredKey} (objectui#8938) for the diagnostic maintainer
 * ruling item 3 asked for, and for the two cases it deliberately stays out of.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The WIDTH of this arm is measured, never declared
 *
 * This arm accepts one spelling rule applied to `FieldSchema`'s WHOLE declared
 * key set, so its width is a property of the linked `@objectstack/spec` and
 * grows with it — ⛔ it is not the handful of keys the cards that asked for it
 * happened to name, and ⛔ no count of it belongs in prose here or in a
 * changeset (objectui#8938; AGENTS.md #9). The instrument that re-derives it is
 * the pin named `the width IS the spec's declared key set, not a list anyone
 * typed`, which drives every snake twin the live spec implies through this
 * choke point.
 *
 * ⛔ The `id_field` slice is BLOCKED, and not on a card. `@objectstack/spec`'s
 * `FIELD_KEY_GUIDANCE` grew an `id_field` row explaining why the key has no
 * successor, but that row is in NO PUBLISHED version — measured against 17.3.0
 * (installed) and 17.4.0 (newest on npm), both zero occurrences, with
 * `startingNumber` as the lit control in the same read. What is missing is a
 * RELEASE, not a decision. Quoting that sentence from a local copy here was
 * refused (a second copy of contract prose is the drift AGENTS.md #0.1 exists
 * to stop) and so was reading it optionally with a local fallback (an invisible
 * fallback that silently degrades on an older spec is this card's own defect
 * class). Until the cut lands, `id_field` is simply left alone.
 *
 * ## What this arm deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * ⛔ It never overwrites. A canonical key the producer already set keeps the
 * producer's value, whatever the legacy twin says — the same rule the
 * `reference` arm follows, for the same reason.
 * ⛔ It never folds a key `FieldSchema` already declares: those are canonical by
 * definition and skipping them is what keeps the pass idempotent.
 * ⛔ It folds nothing onto an AMBIGUOUS probe. If two declared keys ever collide
 * under the probe rule, that probe folds nothing rather than picking one.
 * Measured on 17.3.0: 74 declared keys, zero collisions. The guard is here so a
 * later spec addition cannot silently start choosing.

/**
 * ## ⭐ THE DIAGNOSTIC FOR A SPELLING THIS CHOKE POINT CANNOT FOLD — objectui#8938
 *
 * Maintainer ruling item 3 (objectui#7650, comment 5572018999) asked the
 * execution for "a loud diagnostic (not a silent drop) for a spelling the choke
 * point cannot fold". The fold arm shipped with a warning for the spelling it
 * CAN fold ({@link canonicalizeRetiredFieldKeys}) and nothing for the one it
 * cannot, which is the half the ruling named: a key that folds still reaches
 * every consumer, while a key that does not fold reaches none of them.
 *
 * ⛔ "Not a silent DROP" is about the reader, not about the document. Nothing
 * here removes a key or a value — the leave arm is lossless and stays lossless.
 * What is lost is the READ: the retirement cards in this family (objectui#7155,
 * #7166, #7435) narrowed the consumers to the canonical spelling, so a value
 * that never reaches a canonical key is a value nothing reads. That is the
 * silence this makes audible.
 *
 * ## The three refusals, and why each is a different sentence
 *
 *   - `no-declared-twin` — `FieldSchema` declares neither the key nor anything
 *     sharing its alias probe. `id_field` and `title_format` land here by the
 *     derived rule rather than by an exclusion, and so does a typo (`sortible`):
 *     ⛔ the diagnostic deliberately does NOT offer a near match, for the same
 *     reason the fold does not — the spec's `lintAuthoredRecordKeys` falls
 *     through to a Levenshtein matcher, and a serve path that suggests a
 *     correction is one revision away from applying it.
 *   - `ambiguous-probe` — two or more declared keys share the probe, so the
 *     fold refuses to choose. Unreachable against a spec with no collision;
 *     the pin that exercises it substitutes a colliding `FieldSchema`.
 *   - `canonical-occupied` — the declared twin is already on the def carrying a
 *     DIFFERENT value, and the fold never overwrites a value the producer set.
 *     The producer's value is served, the retired one is inert, and NOTHING said
 *     so before this. ⛔ Same value under both spellings is NOT this case: that
 *     is the state this pass leaves behind on its own second run, and reporting
 *     it would make every re-normalization of a correctly folded def noisy.
 *
 * ## ⛔ What it does NOT fire on — the two exclusions that keep it honest
 *
 *   - A key that DID fold. That case is {@link canonicalizeRetiredFieldKeys}'s
 *     own warning, and firing here as well would report a def that works
 *     exactly as loudly as one that does not.
 *   - `reference_to` / `referenceTo`, which probe onto no declared key and
 *     would otherwise report as `no-declared-twin` while the reference arm was
 *     in the middle of stamping them. They have their own arm and their own
 *     diagnostic ({@link warnOnLegacyOnlyReference}, objectui#6837).
 *
 * Dev-only and memoised, the discipline both existing warnings already use: the
 * adapter re-serves a cached schema and `MetadataProvider` re-normalizes on
 * every metadata refresh, so a warning that floods is a warning that gets muted.

/**
 * Apply {@link normalizeFieldReferenceKeys} to every field of an object
 * schema — BOTH arms: the `reference` pair and the retired dialect. Accepts
 * both field-container shapes the metadata API serves — a `name → def` map or
 * an array of defs — and tolerates anything else by returning the input
 * untouched. Mutates in place; idempotent.
 *
 * This is meant to run at the choke point where object schemas enter the
 * client (`ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema`, the app-shell metadata
 * provider) so per-consumer dual-key fallbacks can't drift.
 *
 * Field NAMES and the OBJECT name are forwarded so the dev-mode warning above
 * can name the whole producer site rather than half of it: the map form keys
 * the def by name, the array form carries it as `def.name`, and the object name
 * comes off `schema.name`.
