 * caller that made exporting it necessary (objectui#5654): it decides whether to
 * show the #3405 "paste a record id" placeholder and help text, and it used to
 * answer with its own literal over RAW param spellings
 * (`param.type === 'lookup' || param.type === 'reference'`). That copy disagreed
 * with this one in BOTH directions, so neither set contained the other:
 *
 *   - `master_detail` degrades here but got no hints there — a targetless
 *     `master_detail` param really did render as an unexplained empty box asking
 *     for a bare UUID, which is exactly the state #3405 added the hints for.
 *   - `reference` was hand-copied out of `PARAM_TYPE_ALIASES`, a spelling this
 *     side never sees: it is folded to `lookup` before the membership test.
 *
 * Note the parameter: an `ActionParamDef`, not a widget key. Callers must not
 * resolve the widget key themselves to ask this — re-deriving the input is how
 * the fork happened. The predicate is exactly equivalent to "`paramToField()`
 * replaced this param's own widget with the text fallback", pinned as an
 * equivalence over every spelling in `paramToField.test.ts` — which is what lets
 * the dialog drop its `field.type === 'text'` proxy for that question.

  // of it — the private copy `LOOKUP_WIDGET_TYPES.has(type) || type === 'user'`,
  // once with a fifth spelling `owner` that objectui#4814 retired (ruling A′).
  //
  // This comment used to add "and last". It was true as far as it had been
  // measured and is now known false, twice over: objectui#5692 found two older
  // copies in `plugin-dashboard`, and objectui#5874 four more (kanban, detail
  // ×2, `resolveActionParams`). No count is restated here on purpose — a
  // hand-kept census of this table is exactly what keeps going stale, and
  // writing a bigger integer would only re-create the defect. The census, its
  // falsification and the lineage of the conversions live in ONE place, the
  // family's canonical home: see the "One family, many consumers — and NO
  // reliable count of them" and "The LAST-private-copy claim was false"
  // sections of `packages/core/src/utils/expand-fields.ts`. The mechanical
  // fact, here and on every converted face, is the identity pin (objectui#5875).
  //
  // The comment that stood here claimed the disjunction "moves in lockstep with
  // plugin-grid's `bulkParamToField` twin — the two param faces are never
  // split". Measured on the tip before this change, that was false in BOTH
  // senses: mechanically, the twin had read core's Set since objectui#4815 while
  // this line read a private literal, so the two faces shared nothing and no
  // gate could report a split; and by membership they already differed, by
  // `tree`. Lockstep is true again — and for the first time it is mechanical,
  // not hand-kept: the identity pin in `paramToField.test.ts` fails on a
  // member-identical private copy, which is what a value check would not.
  //
  // `tree` is the member this face gains, and it is unreachable here: it is
  // absent from `fields`' widget map and `mapFieldTypeToFormType` sends it to
  // `field:lookup`, so every key tested here — always `resolveParamWidgetType`
  // output — arrives as `lookup`. Pinned, so registering a real `tree` widget
  // surfaces that behaviour change instead of shipping it silently.
  //
  // Extending this surface later: OR in a second, surface-local set, the way
  // `needsDataSourceWiring` does. Never `new Set([...EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES, …])`
  // — a copy re-forks the table, which is the defect this change removed, and
  // the identity pin fails on it by design.
