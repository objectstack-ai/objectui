 * Registry `inputs` <-> `@objectstack/spec` `ComponentPropsMap` parity, for
 * EVERY block that has both, in BOTH directions (objectui#3797, objectui#3808).
 *
 * PR #3795 landed both directions on one block (`record:highlights`, see
 * `packages/plugin-detail/src/__tests__/recordHighlightsInputs.spec-parity.test.ts`).
 * This file is the repo-wide half, and it carries the same two:
 *
 *   FORWARD (objectui#3797, PR #3806) — a block may not DECLARE a top-level
 *   input its spec props schema does not accept.
 *
 *   REVERSE (objectui#3808) — a top-level key the spec DOES declare must be
 *   discoverable from that block's `inputs`.
 *
 * Both live in one file on purpose. #3808 exists because PR #3806 shipped only
 * the forward half repo-wide and the reverse half stayed on the single block
 * PR #3795 had covered; keeping them side by side, over one `covered` set and
 * one exemption discipline, is what stops a direction from being forgotten
 * again.
 *
 * WHY THE FORWARD DIRECTION MATTERS. `inputs` is not documentation, it is the
 * published authoring surface, and four layers are silent about a key that only
 * exists there:
 *
 *   1. `packages/sdui-parser/scripts/gen-manifest.ts` serializes `inputs` into
 *      `sdui.manifest.json` (the save-gate + parser whitelist) and into
 *      `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts` (the JSX authoring type surface), so both declare
 *      the key legal;
 *   2. `packages/sdui-parser/src/validate.ts` walks a node's top-level props
 *      against `comp.inputs`, finds the key there, and raises nothing;
 *   3. the spec's props schemas are plain (strip-mode) `z.object`s, so
 *      `parse()` drops an undeclared top-level key with no error;
 *   4. the renderer never sees it.
 *
 * Net: the platform's own manifest tells an author — very often an AI author —
 * to write a key the platform throws away, and nothing anywhere reports it.
 * That is objectstack#5435 ("platform authority must not point at keys its own
 * gate rejects") in reverse, and the second dialect AGENTS.md #0.1 exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * It is not hypothetical on the objectstack side either. Since objectstack#5068,
 * `packages/lint/src/validate-component-props.ts` dispatches on the component
 * `type` and reports undeclared `properties.*` keys on `os validate` /
 * `os build` / `os lint`. So for the exempted keys below, the two platform
 * authorities disagree out loud about the same key today: objectui's manifest
 * offers it, the upstream linter warns on it, and the renderer honours it. Three
 * answers, and they cannot all be right — which is why an exemption here is
 * always paired with an issue that resolves the disagreement, never left as a
 * standing licence.
 *
 * WHY THE REVERSE DIRECTION MATTERS JUST AS MUCH. A key the spec declares, the
 * renderer honours, and `inputs` omits does not exist as far as an author can
 * tell — and the same four layers are just as quiet, only inverted:
 * `gen-manifest.ts` leaves it out of `sdui.manifest.json` and
 * `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts`, so it is in no designer panel and no `.d.ts`;
 * `validate.ts:74` does not find it in `comp.inputs` and reports `unknown-prop`
 * on it; and the renderer honours it anyway. An author who writes it is warned
 * off a key that works, and an author who doesn't never learns it is there.
 * That is objectui#3407's original complaint verbatim (`readonly` was enforced
 * by the HeaderHighlight gate and honoured by the renderer — the description
 * just never mentioned it), and objectui#3808 found it on three more keys plus
 * one this gate now covers as an exemption.
 *
 * The reverse direction bites non-public blocks too, which is the other reason
 * coverage is not limited to `PUBLIC_BLOCKS`: `element:text_input` never reaches
 * `sdui.manifest.json`, but `page.tsx:462` builds the JSX-page compiler's prop
 * whitelist from `getKnownTypes()` + these same `inputs`, so its undeclared
 * `defaultValue` was a live `unknown-prop` warning on a key the renderer seeded
 * page variables from.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE. The check needs the FULL registration graph — the same one
 * that produces the published artifacts. `dev/manifest-dump.tsx` builds them
 * from `src/register-plugins.ts` plus `@object-ui/components`, so this file
 * imports exactly that pair (as `public-contract.test.ts` next door already
 * does) rather than a hand-assembled list that could agree with itself and
 * prove nothing. Coverage is deliberately NOT limited to the public tier:
 * `packages/components/src/renderers/layout/page.tsx:462` builds the runtime
 * JSX-page validation manifest from `getKnownTypes()`, so a non-public block's
 * `inputs` are a live prop whitelist too — that is how `element:record_picker`,
 * absent from `PUBLIC_BLOCKS`, still publishes an authoring surface.
 *
 * EXPECTATIONS ARE DERIVED, NOT RESTATED. The accepted key set comes from
 * `ComponentPropsMap[type]`'s own shape at runtime. A spec release that adds or
 * removes a key therefore moves this gate with it instead of quietly widening
 * the gap — which is also how the stale-pin exemptions below are meant to
 * resolve themselves.
 *
 * EXEMPTIONS ARE EXPLICIT, EACH CARRIES A REASON, AND A STALE ONE FAILS. A new
 * divergence has to be registered in a diff someone reviews; it can never
 * arrive silently. And once the spec declares an exempted key, the entry must be
 * DELETED rather than kept — the last test in this file turns a no-longer-needed
 * exemption red, so the list cannot rot into a permanent allowlist.
 *
 * LIMIT — worth knowing before trusting a pass. Of the two things this gate
 * used to be unable to see, ONE IS NOW GATED and one is still deliberately not:
 *
 *   - member KINDS — CLOSED, objectui#8067. This gate used to compare top-level
 *     key names and nothing else, because an `inputs` entry of type
 *     `array`/`object` declared no member shape at all: `ComponentInput` had no
 *     slot for one, so a member that drifted from the contract was invisible
 *     here. That is what `page:header.actions` cost — spec `z.array(z.string())`
 *     ("Action IDs"), a renderer reading the members as `ActionDef` OBJECTS, and
 *     this gate green for the whole life of the drift because both sides had the
 *     key. `ComponentInput.of` now carries the member kind, and the MEMBER
 *     DIRECTION section below compares every declared one against what
 *     `ComponentPropsMap[type]` accepts at the member position. It stops at the
 *     KIND, exactly as the arm direction does: `of: 'object'` says the members
 *     are objects, never WHICH KEYS they have. Those keys — `record:details
 *     .sections`, `record:highlights.fields` and `record:related_list.add`
 *     among them — publish their members in prose and are pinned by per-block
 *     tests next to their renderers, and since objectui#8068 the MEMBER-PIN
 *     DIRECTION below makes naming that pin MANDATORY rather than voluntary.
 *     PR #3795's open question, half of it closed;
 *   - types, NARROWER than the contract. A key can be in perfect name parity
 *     while declaring fewer arms than the spec accepts, and this gate does not
 *     look. That half is deliberately left to per-block discipline, for the
 *     reason the ARM DIRECTION section below sets out: narrowing is NOISY, and
 *     noise is at least audible. It applies to `of` unchanged — a member union
 *     declared with one arm is not gated either, and the keys left undeclared
 *     for that reason are pinned in `MULTI_KIND_MEMBER_CONTRACTS`.
 *
 * A pass means the top-level key names are in parity, that no declared arm is
 * one the contract refuses outright, and that no declared MEMBER kind is —
 * nothing more.
 *
 * ── THE ARM DIRECTION, AND WHY ONLY ONE OF ITS TWO HALVES IS GATED ──────────
 *                                                             (objectui#4971)
 *
 * `ComponentInput.type` used to carry ONE coarse kind. objectui#3832 gave it
 * the ARRAY form so a key whose contract is a union can declare its real arms —
 * and in doing so created a SECOND way for a declaration to disagree with the
 * contract. The two are not symmetric, and the asymmetry is the whole argument
 * for gating one and not the other:
 *
 *   - NARROWING — declaring FEWER arms than the spec accepts — produces NOISE.
 *     `sdui-parser`'s `checkType` reports `type-mismatch` on a value the
 *     contract is perfectly happy with; the author is warned off a legal write.
 *     Annoying, occasionally harmful (noise on legal writes trains authors, AI
 *     authors included, to dismiss the reports that ARE real) — but AUDIBLE.
 *     Somebody sees it.
 *   - WIDENING — declaring an arm the spec REJECTS — is SILENT. `checkType`
 *     clears a value the contract refuses, the manifest and the generated
 *     `.d.ts` publish it as legal, and `os validate` / `os build` are the first
 *     thing in the chain to say no, long after the metadata was written.
 *     `declared = enforced` inverts, and NOTHING announces it.
 *
 * Before #3832 only the narrow mode existed, so the gap self-announced. After
 * it, the silent mode is live and needs a gate. That is this one, and it is
 * ONE-DIRECTIONAL on purpose: every declared arm must be a shape the contract
 * accepts (a SUBSET of what the spec takes on that key). It does not ask the
 * reverse question.
 *
 * MEASURED, and this is what "done" meant for #4971. Two fake arms were added
 * on the #3832 branch, one per specimen. `element:text_input.defaultValue` grew
 * an `'object'` arm the spec rejects and the per-block
 * `text-input-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts` pinned it red. `page:card.title` grew
 * a `'number'` arm the spec rejects and the WHOLE SUITE stayed green — 856
 * tests, not one gate noticing. The only difference between the two is that
 * `element:text_input` happens to have a per-block test and `page:card` does
 * not: the property held by DISCIPLINE, block by block, not by a gate.
 *
 * ## What an arm is compared against — the COARSE-KIND ceiling
 *
 * An arm names a value's KIND, never its DOMAIN (`ComponentInput.type`, and the
 * maintainer ruling of 2026-08-17 quoted there: "the coarse arm plus
 * `description` IS the publication face's expression ceiling today, and SPEC IS
 * THE SOLE JUDGE OF VALUES"). `page:header.maxVisible` is the worked example —
 * its contract is a POSITIVE SAFE INTEGER, its arm is `'number'`, and `0` /
 * `-1` / `1.5` pass this layer by design.
 *
 * So the question this gate asks is the one the ruling leaves it: does the
 * contract accept ANY value of that kind on that key? A `'number'` arm on a key
 * whose contract is `1..n` is in scope of the ruling and stays green. A
 * `'number'` arm on a key whose contract is a STRING accepts nothing the
 * contract accepts, and is what `declared = enforced` cannot survive.
 *
 * ## Kind-refusal vs value-refusal — the trap this gate is built around
 *
 * The naive probe ("does `safeParse` accept a representative value of this
 * kind?") is WRONG in two measured ways, and both make a CORRECT arm read as
 * invented — the false red triage flagged when this card was scoped:
 *
 *   1. ENUM CONTRACTS. `record:quick_actions.variant` is a spec enum, declared
 *      with a `'string'` arm. A representative string is refused — as a VALUE,
 *      not as a kind. Reading that as "the string arm is fake" would condemn a
 *      declaration the ruling above expressly permits.
 *   2. REQUIRED SIBLINGS. `{ filter: … }` alone fails `element:number`'s schema
 *      for the missing `object` / `aggregate`, and would report every arm of
 *      every key on such a block as fake.
 *
 * `specArmVerdict` therefore reads the ISSUES rather than the boolean: it looks
 * only at issues about THIS key (so siblings cannot speak for it), and it
 * refutes an arm only when the refusal is at the key's own node AND is a KIND
 * refusal (`invalid_type`, or an `invalid_union` whose every branch refuses the
 * kind). A refusal deeper in the value, or of any other code, means the kind got
 * in and the CONTENT was judged — which is precisely the ceiling above, so the
 * arm stands.
 *
 * That is the exemption for enum CONTRACTS, and it is a rule rather than a list.
 * The one thing it must not do is let #4971's own measurement through, so the
 * calibration is asserted by name: `page:card.title` + `42` must read
 * `refuses-kind` (the fake arm reds), while `record:quick_actions.variant` +
 * `'Account'` must read `refuses-content` (the enum arm does not).
 *
 * An `enum` ARM is judged differently and exactly, because it is the one arm
 * whose admitted set is FINITE and written down: `armAccepts` consults the
 * input's own `enum` list, so every declared member must be a value the spec
 * accepts. No coarseness is needed and none is taken.
 *
 * Two arm kinds are EXEMPT, listed rather than silent: `'slot'` (it describes a
 * CHILD POSITION, not a value — `armAccepts` admits everything for it, so there
 * is no value-shaped claim to compare), and an `'enum'` arm that declares NO
 * members (it admits nothing, so it can widen nothing).
 *
 * `retiredKey()` TOMBSTONES USED TO BE THE THIRD — CLOSED, objectui#3809.
 * ADR-0087 D2 retirement replaces a member with `z.never().optional()` instead
 * of deleting it, so raw `Object.keys(shape)` reported a key the spec rejects BY
 * NAME as though the contract accepted it. Both directions read that one set,
 * and they failed OPPOSITE ways on it: forward went falsely GREEN on a block
 * publishing a retired key, reverse went falsely RED demanding that a block
 * publish one. `specTopLevelKeys` now subtracts tombstones, which is the single
 * point that fixes both, and the derivation's own premise — that a retirement
 * KEEPS the member — is asserted rather than assumed (`the tombstone premise
 * still holds`), so the day upstream starts deleting keys outright this filter
 * is judged dead code instead of silently narrowing nothing.
 *
 * The blind spot was NOT dormant by the time it was fixed, which is worth
 * recording because the issue was filed believing it was. It was written against
 * `@objectstack/spec@17.0.0-rc.5`, where `ComponentPropsMap` carried no
 * tombstone at all; the rc.6 pin (objectui#4167) brought EIGHT, the 17.0.0 GA
 * pin (objectui#4636 / PR objectui#4639) carries the same eight, and the reverse
 * direction's red was live from rc.6 onward — absorbed, key by key, by the eight
 * `UNPUBLISHED_EXEMPTIONS` entries that named this issue as the only thing that
 * could resolve them. Those eight are deleted with this change; the pin below
 * (`the eight tombstoned keys are recognised, not exempted`) is what keeps their
 * deletion from being quietly undone by re-exempting a key instead.

 * "Not judged" used to be spelled as absence — a block simply failed both
 * filters and vanished from every set this file computes. Absence is the one
 * state a gate cannot report on, and it is how eight blocks stayed outside this
 * gate unnoticed for its whole life, two of them (`object-calendar`,
 * `object-kanban`) with a real, wrong declaration behind a lazy stub. Fixing

 * a block can no longer leave the judged population without a line here saying
 * so and a diff someone reviews.
 *
 * ## Two classes, each mechanically checked so an entry cannot rot
 *
 * `every unjudged-block ledger entry still describes a block this gate cannot
 * judge` asserts the reason, not just the name:
 *
 *   - EMPTY SPEC SHAPE — `ComponentPropsMap[type]` accepts no top-level key at
 *     all, so neither direction has a question to ask. Whether this repo happens
 *     to register the block is irrelevant to that, which is why it is the
 *     recorded reason even for the ones the app shell does register — a count
 *     this sentence deliberately does not carry, since nothing pins it and the
 *     pin moves it. Asserted as
 *     `specTopLevelKeys(type).length === 0`, so the day upstream gives one of
 *     these blocks props, this entry goes red and the block gets judged.
 *   - NOT REGISTERED, DELIBERATELY — this repo renders no such block on purpose,
 *     and the refusal is written at the site that refuses. Asserted as absent
 *     from `ComponentRegistry.getKnownTypes()` (lazy stubs INCLUDED, so the
 *     assertion cannot be satisfied by the very stub-blindness objectui#8176 is
 *     about), so registering one of them forces this entry out.
 *
 * `aria` is not a member of the empty-shape reasoning: it is a key on non-empty
 * shapes and has its own uniform cover in `GLOBALLY_UNPUBLISHED_SPEC_KEYS`.

 *
 * All twelve entries were deleted on the rc.6 bump, by the `carries no stale
 * exemption` test below, which named every one of them at once. Emptying it is
 * the discipline working end to end rather than an absence of divergence: each
 * entry cited the upstream issue that owned it, and rc.6 is where both of those
 * issues landed. Verified per key against the resolved
 * `ComponentPropsMap[type].shape` at this pin, not from the issues' wording:
 *
 *  - **objectstack#6776** — `page:header` now declares `recordChrome`,
 *    `showStar` and `showCopyId`; `page:accordion` declares `variant`;
 *    `page:tabs` declares `tabStyle`. The five keys the renderer had read all
 *    along are contract now. `page:tabs` is the interesting one: the spec
 *    declares BOTH `tabStyle` and `type`, so the carrier collision written up in
 *    the deleted entry was resolved upstream by declaring the alias rather than
 *    by renaming — which is why `page:tabs.type` stays in
 *    `UNPUBLISHED_EXEMPTIONS` below (spec-declared, unpublishable in a flat
 *    carrier) while `tabStyle` needs no cover at all.
 *  - **objectstack#5775 / PR objectstack#6281** — `element:record_picker`
 *    declares `labelField`, `valueField` and `label`; `page:card` declares
 *    `children` (replacing the retired `body`); and `page:section` /
 *    `page:footer` / `page:sidebar` carry the shared `PageContainerProps`, whose
 *    one key is `children`. Those seven were the objectui#4027 stale-pin set,
 *    predicted in their own reasons ("Delete this entry when the pin moves") and
 *    deleted exactly there.
 *
 * The map stays declared rather than removed: a future divergence needs

 *     and its own issue owns it.
 *
 * ONE CLASS IS GONE, and it is worth knowing which, because it used to be the

   * the reverse direction, reading raw `Object.keys(shape)`, demanded that this
   * repo publish a key the contract rejects by name, and each entry was cover
   * for that false red.
   *
   * They are not deleted by hand-picking. `specTopLevelKeys` now subtracts
   * tombstones, and the two checks that police this list did the rest: the key

   * `carries no stale unpublished-key exemption` reports each as STALE. Both
   * name all eight. Deleting them is the only way to get green, which is the
   * discipline this file's header promises working end to end.
   *
   * THE FIVE UPSTREAM RETIREMENTS these eight came from, kept for the reader who
   * needs to know why none of the keys is coming back — the prescriptions are
   * upstream's, not this repo's:
   *
   *   - objectstack#5775 / PR objectstack#6281 — the `element:record_picker`
   *     trio converges on `labelField` / `valueField` (which this renderer reads
   *     and this repo publishes); `PageCardProps.body` converges on `children`,
   *     the spelling every other container uses and the one `page:card` now
   *     publishes (objectui#4027);
   *   - objectstack#6946 / PR objectstack#7115 — `page:header.icon` (a header's
   *     identity is the record chrome plus each action's own icon),
   *     `page:card.actions` (buttons are authored as components in `children` or
   *     `footer`), and `record:details.layout` (withdrawn here by objectui#3818:
   *     its published `auto` | `custom` semantics were never implemented);
   *   - objectstack#6776 — `page:tabs.type`. This one resolves DIFFERENTLY from
   *     its own entry's prediction, and the difference is worth a sentence. The
   *     entry read it as a live spec key that the flat SDUI carrier cannot
   *     express (a node is `{ type: 'page:tabs', … }`, where `type` is the
   *     dispatch tag, and `validate.ts` lists `'type'` in `BASE_PROPS`), and
   *     called convergence "upstream". Upstream converged: it retired the `type`
   *     spelling in favour of `tabStyle`, which this repo already publishes. So
   *     the carrier collision is not tolerated any more, it is gone — the
   *     contract now has one spelling, and it is the publishable one.
   *
   * Renderer READS of these keys are untouched and stay untouched. A stored
   * document written against the old contract keeps rendering until an ADR-0087
   * D2 conversion rewrites it at load time; a back-compat read is not an
   * authoring surface, so it never belonged in `inputs` (the split
   * `page-header-subtitle-alias` established in `packages/layout`). This harvest
   * withdraws EXEMPTIONS, not capability.
   *
   * WHAT HAPPENS AT THE NEXT PIN BUMP, so nobody reads the next red as a
   * regression: the mechanism is now self-clearing. A key upstream retires after
   * this change enters the shape as a tombstone, leaves the accepted set on
   * arrival, and any exemption covering it goes dangling-and-stale in the same
   * run — no issue needed, no filter to remember.
   *
   * THAT PREDICTION HAS NOW RUN ONCE, AND IT HELD. The paragraph used to say two
   * entries below were queued for it: objectstack `origin/main` tombstoned
   * `targetVariable` on BOTH `element:text_input` and `element:record_picker`
   * while the installed 17.0.0 still carried both as live. The 17.1.0 pin
   * (objectui#5328) delivered those retirements, all three directions named the
   * two entries in the same run, and deleting them was the entire fix —
   * objectui#3834's "should we publish an intent-only key" question having been
   * answered upstream, in the negative. The mechanism needed no maintenance to
   * do that, which is the property worth keeping.
   *
   * DO NOT resolve a tombstone red by declaring the input. That publishes a key
   * the contract rejects by name and fails the forward direction immediately;
   * the two directions of this file are a vice on exactly that move, which is
   * why one of them could not be fixed without the other.

  // GA declares all five and the then-pinned 17.0.0-rc.6 declared none, so
  // declaring the inputs would have failed the FORWARD direction of this very
  // file, and a forward exemption to cover THAT would have gone stale the moment
  // the pin moved (the collision PR objectui#4660 recorded for `SECRET_MASK`).
  //
  // The GA pin landed (objectui#4636 / PR objectui#4639) and objectui#4668
  // declared all five at their registration sites, which is what made `carries
  // no stale unpublished-key exemption` name every one of them at once —
  // exactly as it killed `element:record_picker.filter` when #3830 declared that
  // one. They are pinned as DECLARED, by name, in `the five GA keys

  // derived reverse loop goes green just as readily if a declaration is swapped

  // forbids.
  //

  // ── object-grid's own @deprecated legacy spellings — the RULED carve-out ───
  //                                                          (10 keys)

  // NOT declared. The maintainer ruling of 2026-08-16 on that card reads:
  // "object-grid's own `@deprecated` legacy spellings … are NOT published as new
  // authoring surface — they get reasoned, cited exemptions so a deprecated
  // alias is not hardened."
  //
  // So the reason here is NOT the one every other entry gives. These ten are not
  // undecided, not upstream-owned, and not blocked on anything: the renderer
  // reads all ten and will keep reading them, because documents authored under
  // the old spellings must keep rendering. What is refused is PUBLISHING them —
  // an `inputs` entry is a recommendation to write the key, and recommending a
  // deprecated alias is how a second dialect gets hardened (AGENTS.md #0.1).
  // A back-compat read is not an authoring surface: the same split
  // `page:card.body` records above, and the one `page-header-subtitle-alias`
  // established in `packages/layout`.
  //
  // Each is tagged `@deprecated` in this repo's own `ObjectGridSchema`
  // (`packages/types/src/objectql.ts`), and GA's own `.describe()` text says the
  // same thing from the producer side ("Legacy … fallback, read only when
  // `filter` is absent. Prefer `filter`"). Both authorities agree, which is why
  // this is an exemption rather than an open question. The CANONICAL spelling of
  // each is declared by objectui#4648 in `plugin-grid/src/index.tsx` and named in
  // the reason below, so the pair reads as "write this one instead" rather than
  // as an unexplained hole.
  //
  // THESE DO NOT SELF-RETIRE ON A PIN BUMP, and that is deliberate: unlike the
  // GA-pending five above, no issue owns declaring them later. They retire only
  // if `@objectstack/spec` retires the keys upstream (an ADR-0087 D2 tombstone,
  // which by itself DOES make the entry dangling and stale here, because
  // `specTopLevelKeys` subtracts tombstones — the record_picker trio was
  // harvested that way, and `defaultSort` followed it at 17.3.0)
  // or if objectui un-deprecates a spelling. Do not resolve one by declaring the

  // ── objectui#8176: the two lazily-registered blocks, judged for the first ──
  //     time. FOUR keys left of the eighteen that entered. Three of them are
  //     still A DECLARATION SOMEONE OWES (the arm this map's docblock above
  //     says must name itself); the fourth, `object-kanban.quickAdd`, is the
  //     one ESCALATED entry — see the note further down. None has become a
  //     ruled carve-out, because nobody with standing has ruled yet.
  //
  //     ⚠️ IT STARTED AT EIGHTEEN, and the two that left are the ledger doing
  //     its job rather than a correction to it. `object-kanban.filter` and
  //     `object-calendar.filter` were objectui#7712's two keys; objectui#8186
  //     landed that declaration on all six registrations while this branch was
  //     open, which made both entries STALE — `carries no stale unpublished-key
  //     exemption` named them by name and stayed red until they were deleted
  //     here. That is the documented exit written into the ⛔ note below,
  //     observed on a real landing: a declaration retires its own cover.
  //
  //     These are NOT a new divergence. The registrations and the spec entries
  //     are unchanged; what changed is that this file now loads the two plugin
  //     packages, so `getConfig` answers for them and the reverse direction
  //     reaches them at all. Eighteen is the "dozens" case this file already
  //     owns a route for (see the member-pin transition note below): list them
  //     BY NAME, cite the issue that owns each, and let the existing dangling
  //     and stale checks force their deletion the moment a key is declared.
  //     `the objectui#8176 backlog has a ceiling` below stops the list growing.
  //
  //     ⛔ Not a licence to keep them unpublished — the bar is unchanged. A key
  //     the renderer honours gets DECLARED at its registration site, and the
  //     entry goes stale in the same change.
  // `object-kanban.filter` and `object-calendar.filter` stood here until
  // objectui#8186 declared them. Deleted, not updated — see the ⚠️ note above.
  // `object-calendar.sort` stood here until objectui#8171 declared it on both
  // `plugin-calendar` registrations (PR objectui#8223). Deleted, not updated —
  // the same documented exit the two `filter` entries took above, observed here
  // a second time.
  //   ⚠️ objectui#8201 took SEVEN more by the same exit, and WHICH seven is the
  //   slice boundary that card argued rather than an alphabet, so it is
  //   recorded here: `object-kanban`'s `groupBy`, `cardTitle`, `titleField`,
  //   `swimlaneField` and `coverImageField`, and `object-calendar`'s
  //   `defaultView` and `locale`. Every one of the seven is SCALAR-ARMED
  //   (`string`, or the three-member `enum`), so objectui#8212's tightened
  //   direction adds nothing to its obligation: `structuredInputs` below is
  //   keyed off the DECLARED arm, a scalar arm never enters that population,
  //   no `MEMBER_PINS` entry is owed and `MEMBER_PIN_EXEMPTION_CEILING` does
  //   not move. That is the MECHANICAL statement of the boundary, which is why
  //   it was chosen over "by package" — it is checkable rather than tasteful.
  //   The eight left behind were array/object-armed (`data`, `cardFields`,
  //   `grouping`, `conditionalFormatting`, `staticData`), coupled to one
  //   (`object-calendar.loading`, inert unless `data` is authored because
  //   `ObjectCalendar.tsx` applies it only under `hasExternalData`), or
  //   ESCALATED (`object-kanban.quickAdd` — measured NOT honoured, since
  //   `KanbanImpl` gates the control on `quickAdd && onQuickAdd` and nothing on
  //   the `ObjectKanban` path supplies that runtime slot; whether that is a
  //   permanent carve-out or a feature gap is a product ruling, so the entry
  //   stays as-is until the maintainer rules).
  //   ⚠️ objectui#8313 then took the FOUR `object-kanban` array/object-armed
  //   keys by the same exit, and paid objectui#8212's second obligation in the
  //   same change: each has a `MEMBER_PINS` entry below, none has a member-pin
  //   EXEMPTION, and `MEMBER_PIN_EXEMPTION_CEILING` stays 62 — a declaration
  //   entering the member population must be answered with a pin, which is the
  //   whole point of that ratchet. The four sinks were measured separately and
  //   only one of the four questions is the pass-through the `filter` pins
  //   answer; the `pins` prose on each entry says which. `object-calendar`'s
  //   three (`data`, `staticData`, `loading`) are untouched by that card — they
  //   are the other package, split out under the Q2 = B ruling on objectui#8201.
  //   ⚠️ objectui#8314 THEN TOOK THOSE THREE by the same exit — slice 2b, the
  //   other half of the Q2 = B split — and with them the LIST'S WHOLE
  //   `object-calendar` REMAINDER: `data`, `staticData` and
  //   `loading` are all declared on both `plugin-calendar` registrations, with
  //   a `MEMBER_PINS` entry apiece for the two array keys (registered below,
  //   never an exemption — objectui#8212's three-part obligation). Every
  //   `object-calendar` key the spec declares is now discoverable, and with
  //   objectui#8313's four gone too the entire remaining backlog is one key:
  //   `object-kanban.quickAdd`, the escalated one.
  //   ⚠️ The `loading` clause above was slice 1's REASONING and objectui#8314
  //   measured it: authored `loading: true` replaces a `data`-fed calendar with
  //   its loading placeholder and does nothing at all to a `staticData`-fed
  //   one. The prediction held, so the key was declared on exactly those terms
  //   — its published description names the coupling rather than hiding it.
  //   ⚠️ One correction that outlives the entries, recorded because a future
  //   reader would otherwise inherit the cheap reading of `data`. "An authored
  //   `data` skips the calendar's own fetch" is TRUE ON BOTH CARRIERS and
  //   therefore cannot fail as a pin: `SchemaRenderer` spreads non-metadata
  //   node keys as React props, so the same array is `rest.data` at the
  //   renderer boundary AND `schema.data` inside the component, where the
  //   record-source ladder returns it verbatim as a config that carries no
  //   `provider` and so matches no fetch branch either. Measured by ablation on
  //   objectui#8314: with the boundary's forward removed, "no query was issued"
  //   stayed green while every row asserting the authored ROWS ARE DRAWN went
  //   red. The pin registered below rests on the rows.
  //   ⚠️ One correction that outlives the entry, because the rider note that
  //   stood here asserted the opposite and a future reader would inherit it:
  //   `sort` is NOT a pass-through key, and its member claim is NOT the
  //   identity-forwarding one the two `filter` pins make. `ObjectCalendar.tsx`
  //   writes `$orderby: convertSortToQueryParams(schema.sort)`, and that sink
  //   BUILDS a `field -> direction` map rather than handing the authored array
  //   to the query — so `toBe` on `$orderby` is false about this key and could
  //   never have passed. The pin registered below asserts what is READ inside a
  //   member instead (`field`, `order`, an omitted `order` meaning ascending,
  //   and a member with no usable `field` dropped rather than invented). That
  //   is a SHARPER member claim than a pass-through, not a weaker one.

  // The gap is not new; being GATED is. `@objectstack/spec` 17.1.0 added

  // `plugin-detail/src/index.tsx:675` has always published `hideEmpty` and only
  // `hideEmpty`. Nothing about the renderer or its inputs changed on the pin
  // (objectui#5328).
  //
  // `entries` is an ARRAY OF OBJECTS — `{objectName, relationshipField, title,
  // limit, displayField}` per item — and `inputs` is a flat carrier of scalar
  // fields (`type: 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'enum'`). The same
  // "unpublishable in a flat carrier" reading `page:tabs.type` carried, except
  // here the carrier cannot express the SHAPE rather than colliding on a name.
  //
  // DO NOT resolve this by declaring a scalar input for it: a string field
  // standing in for a list of related-object bindings recommends a write the
  // renderer cannot honour, which is this gate's own failure mode one layer in
  // (the `page:tabs.alwaysShowStrip` note above).
  //
  // NOT blocked on a contract question any more — that half is settled. The
  // maintainer ruled Option B (2026-08-22) and objectui#5494 landed it:
  // `ReferenceRailEntry` is now DERIVED from `@objectstack/spec/ui`
  // (re-exported, never re-declared — `check:spec-symbols` enforces that), and
  // the `icon` key the old local interface carried retired with the
  // derivation. The spec's `ReferenceRailEntrySchema` is `$strict` over
  // {objectName, relationshipField, title?, limit?, displayField?} and refuses
  // `icon` at save, so it survives on neither side of the contract.
  //
  // The note this replaces also asserted that the renderer READ that key. It
  // did not — that premise was false when it was written, which is the whole
  // reason this block was rewritten (objectui#5792). Measured twice,
  // independently: the spec's `ui-reference-rail-unknown-keys-refused`
  // migration entry, and a grep over `plugin-detail/src` where the only
  // surviving `icon` mention in `record-reference-rail.tsx` is prose, while the
  // same grep finds real reads of `entry.objectName`, `.relationshipField`,
  // `.title`, `.limit` and `.displayField`. So the SHAPE limit above is the
  // entire justification for this exemption — it always was sufficient alone.

/**
 * Exemption entries whose KEY the installed spec is allowed not to declare yet.
 *
 * Every other entry in `UNPUBLISHED_EXEMPTIONS` describes a key the installed
 * spec declares right now — that is what `every unpublished-key exemption names
 * a key the spec really declares` asserts, and it is why a typo cannot hide in
 * the list. These ten describe keys of a block only @objectstack/spec 17.0.0 GA
 * carries, so on a pin predating the GA element set they describe nothing yet.
 *
 * Pinning them as a SET rather than skipping "any entry the spec does not
 * declare" is the whole safety of the mechanism: only these entries may be
 * dormant, and `every GA-pending exemption arms exactly with the installed
 * spec` asserts that their dormancy tracks the installed element set in BOTH
 * directions — so a GA release that dropped one of them fails here instead of
 * leaving an entry that quietly covers nothing.
 *
 * ONE GROUP NOW, and knowing which one LEFT matters more than the one that
 * stayed:
 *
 *   - the ten `object-grid` entries are objectui#4648's RULED carve-out. They
 *     are dormant only on a pin that does not carry `object-grid` at all, so
 *     none of its keys resolves; on a GA tree they are fully judged. They are
 *     not awaiting declaration — see their reasons above;
 *   - the FIVE that were listed first here (`page:header.maxVisible`,
 *     `page:header.mobileMaxVisible`, `page:tabs.alwaysShowStrip`,
 *     `record:details.inlineEdit`, `record:details.showHeader`) were the other
 *     kind: keys on blocks the pin already carried, awaiting declaration. They
 *     retired the way this mechanism intends — the pin moved to GA, objectui#4668
 *     declared all five, and their exemption entries went stale in the same run.
 *     A "pending" entry that never lands is the rot this set exists to make
 *     visible; these five are the worked example of it not happening.
 *
 * So the two arms of `isDormantOnThisPin` are no longer symmetric in practice:
 * a future entry here is either a ruled carve-out on a block the pin may not
 * carry, or a declaration someone owes. Say which in the reason.

 *  - `invalid_value` at the node — a closed list of literals — is decided by
 *    the list: a probe of a kind NO listed value has is refused for its kind,
 *    while one that shares a kind with some listed value is refused for its
 *    VALUE. Both halves are load-bearing and were measured on
 *    `record:quick_actions.variant`, a spec enum of strings: `'Account'` must
 *    read as a value refusal (or the block's correct `'string'` arm reads as
 *    invented — the false red triage flagged), and `42` must read as a KIND
 *    refusal (or a `'number'` arm on an enum contract would be exactly the
 *    silent widening this gate exists for, waved through by the same rule that
 *    protects the string arm). One key, both directions, so the two cannot be
 *    collapsed into one answer;
 *  - anything else at the node (`too_small`, `invalid_format`, a custom
 *    refinement) is a VALUE refusal, and the coarse-kind ceiling
 *    (`ComponentInput.type`, maintainer 2026-08-17) puts it outside what an arm
 *    claims — UNLESS an `invalid_type` sits beside it, which is the next
 *    paragraph.
 *
 * ## WHY `invalid_type` IS DECISIVE AND NOT JUST ANOTHER `every` MEMBER
 *
 * The two rules are not the same statement, and objectui#8204 is the difference.
 * A node can carry a kind refusal AND a content complaint at once, because Zod
 * keeps running a schema's checks after its type check has already failed: for
 * `z.string().min(1)` the probe `[]` comes back as BOTH `invalid_type`
 * (expected string) AND `too_small` (`[].length` is 0), at the same node, in
 * that order. Read by `every` alone that pair is a CONTENT refusal — one member
 * of the pair is not a kind code — and the value it describes is an array that
 * the contract refused for being an array.
 *
 * `some(invalid_type)` first is the fix, and it is a statement about the
 * contract rather than about Zod: `invalid_type` at a node says the value is not
 * of that node's type, and a value cannot be simultaneously the right kind and
 * the wrong one. Whatever else the node says about a value it has already
 * refused for its kind is downstream of that refusal, not a second opinion
 * competing with it. (`too_small` on a non-string is exactly such an artefact:
 * "too short" is not a claim anyone would make about `[]` against a string
 * contract.)
 *
 * MEASURED on the installed `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 artifact, on the union
 * this card was filed for — `record:activity.types`,
 * `z.array(z.union([FeedItemType, z.string().min(1)]))`. Two array probes, one
 * key, opposite readings under the old rule, and the ONLY difference between
 * them is the artefact issue:
 *
 *     probe `[]`          branch 2 issues -> [invalid_type, too_small] -> every() false
 *     probe `['Account']` branch 2 issues -> [invalid_type]            -> every() true
 *
 * so `[]` alone put `array` into the accepted kind set of a key whose array
 * members the contract measurably refuses, and the derivation gate read
 * `contract accepts {string,array}`. The union recursion below was NEVER the
 * missing piece — it runs, and it is what carries the branch verdicts up — the
 * per-branch reading underneath it was wrong.

//
// ⚠️ That merge changed a NUMBER in this paragraph and nothing else in this
// direction. `of` is a DECLARATION, not a pin, so it neither satisfies nor
// exempts anything below: the population this direction judges, its ledger and
// its ceiling are the same on the merged tree as they were on the branch that
// measured them.
//
// That note then names the mitigation — `record:details.sections`,
// `record:highlights.fields` and `record:related_list.add` "publish their
// members in prose and are pinned by per-block tests next to their renderers".
// All three pins are real. What was NOT real is any requirement that a fourth
// key get one.
//
// `page:header.actions` is that fourth key, and it is the measurement this
// direction exists for. Array-typed, member shape in `description` prose only
// (`packages/components/src/renderers/layout/containers.tsx`), spec
// `z.array(z.string())` — action IDs — while the renderer read the members as
// `ActionDef` OBJECTS and resolved nothing, so metadata satisfying the published
// contract rendered ZERO buttons. Every layer was green: the key names are in
// parity (forward and reverse), the `'array'` arm is a kind the contract accepts
// (the arm direction), and no per-block test existed to look inside. It took a
// human filing objectstack#11592 and a maintainer ruling (2026-08-25) to settle
// it, and `packages/components/src/__tests__/page-header-action-ids.test.tsx` —
// the fourth pin — arrived as part of that FIX (objectui#6252), not because
// anything demanded it.
//
// Three keys got it right, the fourth did not, and nothing noticed the fourth.
// So the discipline stops being voluntary here: every array/object-armed input
// on a covered block must name a pin, or carry an exemption.
//
// ## WHAT THIS DIRECTION CAN AND CANNOT JUDGE
//
// The criterion objectui#8068 sets is a JUDGEMENT, not a computation: a pin must
// constrain the shape the renderer actually READS, rather than restate the
// registration. A registration saying `of: 'string'` while the code reads
// members as objects is the exact hole, and no mechanical reader can tell the
// two apart — the four exemplars do it four different ways (a description
// derived from the spec's element schema, a spec-vs-declaration arm set, a
// renderer-default comparison, and a twice-authored render equivalence).
//
// So this direction is built the way every exemption in this file is: the
// judgement is made in a diff someone reviews, and what is MECHANISED is the
// part that rots silently. A registered pin must
//
//   1. exist on disk — a deleted or renamed pin file is the failure mode that
//      leaves the key uncovered while the registry entry still reads deliberate;
//   2. be a file the test runner collects, so "pinned" means "executed";
//   3. NAME the block and NAME the key, so an entry cannot point at a file that
//      says nothing about this key. That is the locator, and it is why the
//      calibration below asserts it discriminates: a check that matched any file
//      would license every entry at once.
//
// ## THE POPULATION, MEASURED FIRST — 58 of 77 (objectui#8071)
//
// objectui#8068 required the number before the gate, because the number chooses
// the route: single digits means add the pins and let the gate bite, dozens
// means a transition. Measured on this branch, over this file's own `covered`
// set: 77 array/object-armed inputs across 22 blocks, of which 19 already have a
// pin that meets both the criterion and the locator. 58 do not.
//
// ⚠️ THAT CENSUS WAS TAKEN OVER AN INCOMPLETE POPULATION — objectui#8176. Two
// spec-carried blocks were missing from `covered` because `getConfig` is
// loaded-only and the console registers plugin blocks with `registerLazy`, so
// 77/22/58 was never the whole tree. Re-measured over the corrected population:
// 81 array/object-armed inputs across 24 blocks, 19 pinned, 62 not. The four
// that moved are `object-calendar.calendar` / `.dataSource` and
// `object-kanban.columns` / `.dataSource` — pre-existing declarations, named in
// `NEWLY_JUDGED_UNPINNED_MEMBERS`, and the reason
// `MEMBER_PIN_EXEMPTION_CEILING` reads 62. objectui#8071's work is unchanged in
// kind and four keys longer in extent.
//
// ⚠️ THE POPULATION THEN GREW BY TWO, and they were answered with PINS rather
// than with room. objectui#8186 landed objectui#7712's declaration while this
// branch was open, so `object-calendar.filter` and `object-kanban.filter`
// became array-armed inputs on newly judged blocks — exactly the case this
// ceiling exists to refuse absorbing. Both are in `MEMBER_PINS` below: the
// calendar's is the file objectui#7711 already left behind, the kanban's was
// written for this change. 83 array/object-armed inputs across 24 blocks, 21
// pinned, 62 not — and the ceiling does NOT move. A genuinely new array key
// gets a pin, which is the whole rule, now demonstrated rather than only
// asserted.
//
// ⚠️ AND THEN BY FOUR MORE, answered the same way. objectui#8313 declared
// `object-kanban`'s `data`, `cardFields`, `grouping` and
// `conditionalFormatting` — the array/object-armed half of the backlog
// objectui#8201 left behind — so all four entered this population at once. All
// four got PINS. Measured over the ledger this file carries, before and after:
// 84 array/object-armed inputs, 22 pinned, 62 not -> 88, 26 pinned, 62 not. The
// exemption list is byte-identical and the ceiling is still 62, which is the
// demonstration the paragraph above claims: FOUR new array keys at once could
// not be absorbed by room, because there is none to absorb them with.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE TRANSITION HAS STARTED SPENDING ITSELF DOWN. objectui#8071's
// first slice converted FOUR keys from exemption to pin — `object-form.fields`,
// `object-grid.exportOptions`, `object-grid.bulkActions` and
// `object-grid.bulkActionDefs` — the four the card singled out because a
// near-miss contract test already existed for each. Measured over this file's
// own ledger, before and after: 90 array/object-armed inputs, 28 pinned, 62
// exempt -> 90, 32 pinned, 58 exempt. The population does not move (a pin and
// an exemption are the two halves of one partition), and
// `MEMBER_PIN_EXEMPTION_CEILING` moves WITH the list, 62 -> 58 — see its own
// docblock for why a ceiling that does not follow the count down is a budget
// rather than a ratchet.
//
// ⛔ What those near-miss tests were NOT. Two of the three the card named cover
// a NEIGHBOURING key rather than the one they were credited with.
// `sectionFields.spec-parity.test.ts` pins `sections[].fields`, whose member is
// the spec `FormFieldSchema` object keyed on `field`, while the top-level
// `object-form.fields` reads BARE NAMES and drops that very object in silence;
// `bulk-action-spec-parity.test.ts` pins the `BulkActionDef` TYPE against the
// spec and never touches either key's member read. So three of these four pins
// are new behavioural files rather than one added assertion, and the fourth
// (`exportOptions`) grew a third direction on an existing scanner. The locator
// would have accepted the first file on its STRINGS alone — it already contains
// both `object-form` and `fields` — which is the concrete reason `MEMBER_PINS`
// is reviewed rather than computed.
//
// ⚠️ SECOND SLICE, AND THE FIRST ONE TAKEN A BLOCK AT A TIME. objectui#8071's
// second slice converted four keys on ONE block — `record:related_list`'s
// `columns`, `dataSource`, `filter` and `sort` — chosen for a coherent file
// surface rather than for near-miss tests: one renderer
// (`renderers/record-related-list.tsx` over `RelatedList.tsx`) and one existing
// spec-parity file. Measured over this file's own ledger, before and after: 90
// array/object-armed inputs, 32 pinned, 58 exempt -> 90, 36 pinned, 54 exempt,
// and `MEMBER_PIN_EXEMPTION_CEILING` follows 58 -> 54 in the same commit.
//
// ⭐ Two of the four were PROMOTED pre-existing files, and slice 1's trap is the
// reason that sentence needs the qualifier. `RelatedList.listFilter.test.tsx`
// and `RecordRelatedListRenderer.elementDataSource.test.tsx` were read end to
// end before being credited, and they really do pin the member shape their key
// names. The second one ALSO names `columns` and `sort` — it asserts a saved
// view's `columns`/`sort` reach the list — so the locator would have accepted it
// for those two keys as well, on its strings, while pinning nothing about what
// an authored member of either key IS. Those two got new behavioural files
// instead. That is `sectionFields.spec-parity.test.ts` one slice on, in the same
// file the correct credit came from.
//
// ⛔ AND THE BLOCK IS NOT EMPTY. `record:related_list.actions` stays exempt on a
// reason of its own: nothing reads it. The registration declares it
// (`of: 'string'`, "Action IDs available for related records"), the SPEC
// declares it (`RecordRelatedListProps.actions`), and the renderer never touches
// `schema.actions` — the row and toolbar actions it draws come from the host
// bridge `useRelatedRecordActions()`. A member pin constrains what the RENDERER
// READS, so there is nothing here to constrain; the honest pin available is "the
// key is dead", which is a statement that the contract is wrong rather than a
// member shape, and fixing it is an ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove decision the spec
// owns. See `NO_READ_SITE_TO_PIN`.
//
// ⭐ THIRD SLICE, AND THE FIRST BLOCK LEFT WITH NO EXEMPTIONS AT ALL.
// objectui#8071's third slice converted the four remaining keys of
// `element:record_picker` — `dataSource`, `label`, `placeholder` and `sort` —
// the batch this card's own dispatch names as the example of "one block
// family". Unlike `record:related_list`, nothing here needed a
// `NO_READ_SITE_TO_PIN`: every declared key on this block has a real read site,
// so the block drops out of `MEMBER_PIN_EXEMPTIONS` entirely rather than
// leaving one entry behind. Measured over this file's own ledger, before and
// after: 90 array/object-armed inputs, 36 pinned, 54 exempt -> 90, 40 pinned,
// 50 exempt, and `MEMBER_PIN_EXEMPTION_CEILING` follows 54 -> 50 in the same
// commit. Two of the four pins PROMOTE pre-existing files (`dataSource`, and
// one file covering both `label` and `placeholder`), read end to end first;
// `sort` — the standalone `properties.sort` key, as opposed to the
// `dataSource.sort` sub-member the promoted `dataSource` file already
// exercised — had no existing candidate anywhere in the repo, so it is a new
// file. See `MEMBER_PIN_EXEMPTION_CEILING`'s own docblock for the accounting.
//
// ⭐ FOURTH SLICE, THE SECOND WHOLE BLOCK CLOSED, AND A TWO-KEY FAMILY.
// objectui#8071's fourth slice converted both remaining keys of ONE block —
// `record:quick_actions`'s `actionNames` and `requiredPermissions` — chosen
// because the block's remaining population is small enough to close outright
// (the shape this card's own dispatch names, over an arbitrary four). Neither
// key needed `NO_READ_SITE_TO_PIN`: `actionNames` drives a real
// `useMetadataItem` lookup against the object's own `actions`, and
// `requiredPermissions` is a block-level gate (`required.every((p) =>
// perms.can(objectName, p))`) that hides the whole bar before anything is
// drawn — a DIFFERENT mechanism from an `ActionDef`'s own per-action field of
// the same name, which a pre-existing fixture already exercised without
// touching this key at all. Measured over this file's own ledger, before and
// after: 90 array/object-armed inputs, 40 pinned, 50 exempt -> 90, 42 pinned,
// 48 exempt, and `MEMBER_PIN_EXEMPTION_CEILING` follows 50 -> 48 in the same
// commit. One of the two pins PROMOTES a pre-existing file
// (`recordQuickActionsInputs.actionNamesFallback.test.tsx`); the other
// (`requiredPermissions`) is new, for the reason above.
//
// A list this size is the transition case, and this file already owns the
// pattern for it —
// `OFF_SPEC_EXEMPTIONS` / `UNPUBLISHED_EXEMPTIONS` / `OFF_SPEC_ARM_EXEMPTIONS`
// are explicit, reasoned, issue-backed, and go RED once stale. This is the same
// mechanism, not a second one: `MEMBER_PIN_EXEMPTIONS` below lists all 50
// remaining keys BY NAME, every entry cites an issue, and an
// entry whose key acquires a pin is reported STALE and must be deleted in the
// same change. The list has a CEILING as well as a stale check, because the
// cheap way to green a new array key is to add a 51st entry rather than a pin.
//
// ## WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN THE POPULATION, stated rather than dropped
//
// `covered` — this file's own set, spec-carried blocks that declare inputs — is
// the population, unchanged. The wider registration graph carries 310
// array/object-armed inputs across 501 registered type names (aliases included:
// `object-grid`, `plugin-grid:object-grid` and `view:grid` are three names for
// one registration), and 233 of those sit on blocks with no `ComponentPropsMap`
// entry. NO direction in this file has ever judged them — a member pin needs a
// published contract to compare a member shape against, and those blocks have
// none. That boundary is pre-existing rather than a narrowing taken here, and it
// is recorded in objectui#8071 so it cannot go quiet.

Those defaults are NOT uniform, which is the trap this pin exists for and is asserted per member: `showCommentInput` is `!== false` (ON when absent) while `enableReactions` and `enableThreading` are `?? false` (OFF), so `feed: {}` silently takes reactions and threading down while leaving the composer up.

/**
 * How many keys may be exempt. Ratchet: this number may only ever go DOWN.
 *
 * Measured with objectui#8068 and pinned so the list cannot grow. Without it the
 * cheapest way to green a newly added array-typed input is an exemption entry
 * with the same reason as its 58 neighbours — which is exactly the "voluntary"
 * state this direction was built to end, one entry further in.
 *
 * ## 58 -> 62, and why that is a CORRECTION rather than a loosening
 *
 * ⚠️ The one number in this file that has gone UP. It is the judgement call in
 * objectui#8176's change and it is written out here rather than left in a diff,
 * because a reviewer who disagrees with the reading should be able to find it
 * without reading the whole card.
 *
 * The 58 was measured "over this file's own `covered` set" — and objectui#8176
 * is the finding that `covered` was wrong: it held 27 of the 42 spec-carried
 * blocks, because `getConfig` is loaded-only and the console registers plugin
 * blocks with `registerLazy`. `object-calendar` and `object-kanban` were never
 * offered to objectui#8068's census. Over the corrected population the same
 * measurement, by the same method, yields 81 array/object-armed inputs across 24
 * blocks, 19 pinned and 62 not.
 *
 * So this raise admits no new key. It admits four PRE-EXISTING declarations that
 * the census could not see, named individually in
 * `NEWLY_JUDGED_UNPINNED_MEMBERS` above and asserted by name below. Nothing
 * about what the ratchet forbids changes: a genuinely new array-typed input
 * still cannot be absorbed, because 62 is now the true measured floor and the
 * count may still only go down from it.
 *
 * ⛔ The reading a future edit must not take from this: that a ceiling may be
 * raised to fit a list. The ONLY thing that licensed it here is that the
 * population itself was mis-measured, and that fact is independently asserted —
 * if `states the size of the population it judges` and
 * `no spec-carried block is registered but unloaded` ever stop holding, this
 * paragraph stops being true and the number owes a re-derivation, not a bump.
 *
 * ## 62 -> 58, and why the number MOVES WITH the list rather than trailing it
 *
 * objectui#8071's first slice converted four keys to pins — `object-form.fields`
 * and `object-grid`'s `exportOptions` / `bulkActions` / `bulkActionDefs` — and
 * deleted their four entries. A ceiling left at 62 would then have held FOUR
 * unused slots, and unused slots are exactly the thing this constant exists to
 * deny: the next genuinely new array-typed key could have been greened with an
 * exemption entry and no pin, which is the "voluntary" state the ratchet was
 * built to end. So the ceiling follows the list down in the same change that
 * shortens it. That is what "may only ever go DOWN" has to mean to be worth
 * anything — a number nobody lowers is a budget, not a ratchet.
 *
 * ## 58 -> 54, the second slice, and the rule applied rather than restated
 *
 * objectui#8071's second slice converted four keys on ONE block —
 * `record:related_list`'s `columns`, `dataSource`, `filter` and `sort` — and
 * deleted their four entries, so the ceiling follows to 54 in the same commit.
 * Nothing about the argument above changes; this is the paragraph existing to
 * show it is a rule and not a one-off.
 *
 * ⚠️ The block is NOT emptied: `record:related_list.actions` stays exempt, and
 * on a reason of its own (`NO_READ_SITE_TO_PIN`) rather than the shared one. A
 * ceiling of 54 counts it like any other entry — a key that cannot be pinned
 * still occupies a slot, because the ratchet counts EXEMPTIONS, not excuses.
 *
 * ## 54 -> 50, the third slice, and the first WHOLE BLOCK closed
 *
 * objectui#8071's third slice converted all four remaining keys of ONE block —
 * `element:record_picker`'s `dataSource`, `label`, `placeholder` and `sort` —
 * and deleted their four entries, so the ceiling follows to 50 in the same
 * commit. Unlike `record:related_list` (slice 2), this block has no
 * `NO_READ_SITE_TO_PIN` leftover: every key it declares now carries a real
 * member pin, and the `element:record_picker` header comment above stays only
 * as a landmark for a future grep, not because anything under it is exempt.
 *
 * Two of the four were PROMOTED pre-existing files, read end to end before
 * being credited rather than trusted on their strings — the same discipline
 * slices 1 and 2 applied: `record-picker-element-data-source.test.tsx` (for
 * `dataSource`) and `record-picker-label-placeholder-i18n.test.tsx` (for BOTH
 * `label` and `placeholder`, which is why those two rows in `MEMBER_PINS` point
 * at the same file — it was written to cover the pair). `sort` had no
 * candidate at all — nothing in the repo exercised the flat, standalone
 * `properties.sort` key before this slice — so it is the one genuinely new
 * file.
 *
 * ## 50 -> 48, the fourth slice, and a two-key block closed the same way
 *
 * objectui#8071's fourth slice converted both remaining keys of ONE block —
 * `record:quick_actions`'s `actionNames` and `requiredPermissions` — and
 * deleted their two entries, so the ceiling follows to 48 in the same commit.
 * Like `element:record_picker` (slice 3) and unlike `record:related_list`
 * (slice 2), this block has no `NO_READ_SITE_TO_PIN` leftover: both declared
 * keys have a real read site in `renderers/record-quick-actions.tsx` — the
 * `actionNames` -> `useMetadataItem` lookup, and the `requiredPermissions`
 * block-level gate that runs before any action is drawn — so the block drops
 * out of `MEMBER_PIN_EXEMPTIONS` entirely.
 *
 * One of the two pins PROMOTES a pre-existing file
 * (`recordQuickActionsInputs.actionNamesFallback.test.tsx`, written for
 * objectui#4663 but already driving the exact `actionNames` read this key
 * needs, read end to end before being credited); `requiredPermissions` had no
 * candidate — every existing reference to that name in this renderer's test
 * suite is an ActionDef's own PER-ACTION field, a different mechanism — so it
 * is a new file.

 * ## 48 -> 46, the fifth slice, and a whole `object-calendar` block closed
 *
 * objectui#8071's fifth slice converted the two keys objectui#8176 had left
 * unpinned on `object-calendar` — `calendar` and `dataSource` — and deleted
 * their two entries, so the ceiling follows to 46 in the same commit. Every
 * OTHER key this block declares (`data`, `filter`, `sort`, `staticData`) was
 * already pinned, so the block now carries zero exemptions, the same shape
 * `element:record_picker` (slice 3) and `record:quick_actions` (slice 4)
 * closed in — chosen for exactly that reason: a two-key remainder on one
 * already-mostly-pinned block, closeable outright rather than left with a
 * straggler.
 *
 * `dataSource` is the per-element binding every `elementDataSourceBlock`
 * publishes (`ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT`, `@object-ui/core`) — the same
 * mechanism `element:record_picker.dataSource` and
 * `record:related_list.dataSource` already pin — and it PROMOTES a
 * pre-existing file, `ObjectCalendar.elementDataSource.test.tsx`, read end to
 * end before being credited: it already drove the binding's `object` write
 * onto `objectName`, `filter`/`sort` read off the named view, an unresolvable
 * `view` reporting instead of fetching unfiltered, and a calendar with no
 * binding behaving exactly as before. `calendar` had no single candidate that
 * covered its own member set (which keys of the config object become which
 * part of an event, and which of the two spellings — the nested object or the
 * flat legacy fields `getCalendarConfig` falls back to — wins when a schema
 * somehow carries both) — the ladder and all-day pieces of that config were
 * each already pinned narrowly (`ObjectCalendar.colorFieldLadder-7243.test.tsx`,
 * `ObjectCalendar.allDayFieldIsHonoured-8026.test.tsx`) but neither, nor
 * anything else, asserted `startDateField`/`endDateField` reaching an event's
 * `start`/`end`, `titleField` outranking the object's own display-name
 * resolution, or the object-vs-flat precedence — so it is a new file,
 * `objectCalendarConfigMembers-8071.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## 46 -> 41, the sixth slice, and FIVE whole blocks closed at once
 *
 * objectui#8071's sixth slice took the five `record:*` detail-panel blocks that
 * each carried exactly ONE unpinned key — `record:activity.types`,
 * `record:alert.action`, `record:chatter.feed`, `record:discussion.feed` and
 * `record:path.stages` — and pinned all five, so the ceiling follows to 41 in
 * the same commit. Every one of the five blocks now carries zero exemptions,
 * the shape `element:record_picker` (slice 3), `record:quick_actions` (slice 4)
 * and `object-calendar` (slice 5) each closed in; this slice is the first to
 * close more than one block, and the batch is coherent rather than opportunistic
 * — one package (`packages/plugin-detail`), one family, and the selection rule
 * is stateable in a sentence (every block whose remainder was exactly one key).
 *
 * `record:chatter.feed` and `record:discussion.feed` are ONE key on ONE
 * renderer: the console registers `RecordChatterRenderer` under both names
 * against the same `CHATTER_INPUTS`, so both rows point at one file that runs
 * every case against both names — the shape slice 3 used for
 * `record-picker-label-placeholder-i18n.test.tsx`, which covered `label` and
 * `placeholder` together.
 *
 * One of the five PROMOTES a pre-existing file: `recordActivityFeed.test.ts`
 * for `record:activity.types`, read end to end before being credited rather
 * than trusted on its greps — it already asserts the allow-list's member
 * semantics directly on `applyFeedConfig` (the call the renderer makes on every
 * render), including objectui#5841's three distinct ways an authored list can
 * name nothing and why none of them is "no filter". The other three files are
 * new: the six existing `record:path` suites all use `stages[]` as a FIXTURE
 * for a different subject (accessible names, the container label, the readout's
 * inertness, cross-row agreement) and none would fail if `value`, `label` and
 * `terminal` swapped roles; the six `record:alert` suites reference `action`
 * only inside a props bag whose subject is `resultDialog` or the `visible`
 * predicate; and the one `record:chatter` suite is about the host's `loading`
 * signal and never authors `feed` at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ RE-POINTED by objectui#8934, which reversed the reading this paragraph
 * used to carry. It recorded the `feed` pin as a LIMIT: `config.feed` reached
 * `RecordActivityTimeline`, which read the five AFFORDANCE members only, while
 * `record:activity`'s FILTER members (`types`, `limit`, `showCompleted`,
 * `unifiedTimeline`) were applied by `applyFeedConfig`, which only
 * `record-activity.tsx` called — so they were inert nested inside `feed`, and
 * that was called a contract defect. It was an IMPLEMENTATION GAP against a
 * WIDER protocol instead: `@objectstack/spec` declares
 * `RecordChatterProps.feed` as `RecordActivityProps` (`component.zod.ts:1366`),
 * so objectui#8934 closed the gap in `renderers/record-chatter.tsx` rather than
 * narrowing the declaration, and the four filter members are live on that path
 * now. (`filterMode` and `enableMentions` are still unread there —
 * objectui#8968.) This block's own row is unaffected either way: nothing in
 * this file asserts on that description string.
 *
 * ## 41 -> 37, the seventh slice, and the LAST four one-key blocks closed
 *
 * objectui#8071's seventh slice applied slice 6's selection rule to what it left
 * behind: every block whose remainder was exactly one key. Four qualified —
 * `element:button.action`, `element:number.filter`, `page:accordion.items` and
 * `page:tabs.items` — so the ceiling follows to 37 in the same commit, and all
 * four blocks now carry zero exemptions.
 *
 * The batch is coherent rather than opportunistic on the same terms slice 6 set:
 * one package (`packages/components`) registers all four, the two `element:*`
 * keys sharing `renderers/basic/elements.tsx` and the two `page:*` keys sharing
 * `renderers/layout/containers.tsx`, and the rule is stateable in a sentence.
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO one-key blocks were deliberately NOT taken, and neither is a leftover
 * this slice could have absorbed:
 *
 *   - `record:related_list.actions` is the `NO_READ_SITE_TO_PIN` sentinel, and
 *     the reading was RE-MEASURED here rather than inherited: on this tree
 *     `renderers/record-related-list.tsx` still contains ZERO case-sensitive
 *     occurrences of `actions` (control: `import` reads 9 in the same file), and
 *     the only near-matches are `useRelatedRecordActions` / `relatedActions` —
 *     the host bridge the constant already names. Nothing to pin, still.
 *   - `object-kanban`'s `columns` / `dataSource` are the
 *     `NEWLY_JUDGED_UNPINNED_MEMBERS` pair, held by an unruled contract question
 *     (objectui#8913) about whether `columns` survives as judged structure at
 *     all. Pinning a shape a pending ruling may delete would be worse than
 *     leaving it exempt, so `NEWLY_JUDGED_UNPINNED_MEMBERS` is UNCHANGED by this
 *     slice — no block it names was touched.
 *
 * ⇒ After this slice every remaining exemption sits on one of four
 * MULTI-key blocks (`object-grid` 15, `object-form` 7,
 * `object-master-detail-form` 6, `object-metric` 6) plus the two held keys. The
 * "close a block outright by taking its last key" shape is now EXHAUSTED, and
 * the next slice is the first that has to take a partial block or close a
 * multi-key one whole — stated here so the next reader does not spend the
 * search rediscovering it.
 *
 * Three of the four pins are new files; none of the four keys had a
 * pre-existing file covering its member SET, and each candidate was read end to
 * end before being rejected rather than dismissed on its greps.
 * `element-button-action.test.tsx` drives only `type` and `to` on one
 * navigation action; `action-bodyExtra-forward.test.tsx` pins one member across
 * four renderers; `page-accordion-icon.test.tsx` pins `icon` alone; the five
 * `page:tabs` suites pin one member each; and
 * `element-number.contractEnvelope-6726.test.tsx` drives the same `find()`
 * fallback branch but never authors a `filter`, so the locator itself would
 * refuse it. ⚠️ `action-bodyShape-forward.test.tsx` is the one that had to be
 * refused rather than merely passed over: it NAMES `element:button` and the key
 * `action`, so it would satisfy the locator, while what it actually says is
 * that `element:button` is deliberately out of its scope. Crediting it would
 * have been a pin that asserts the opposite of its claim — the false-negative
 * shape objectui#8068 exists to end. Its boundary is instead pinned as
 * behaviour in the new file, which authors `bodyShape` and asserts it is
 * dropped.
 *
 * ## 37 -> 33, the eighth slice, and the FIRST partial bite of a multi-key block
 *
 * objectui#8071's eighth slice is the first that could not close a block by
 * taking its last key — slice 7 exhausted that shape — so it takes a PART of
 * one, and the part is chosen by a rule rather than by convenience:
 *
 *   **every `object-metric` member that shapes the aggregate query behind the
 *   NUMBER the tile paints.**
 *
 * Four qualify — `dataSource`, `aggregate`, `filter` and `compareTo` — so the
 * ceiling follows to 33 in the same commit. The rule is mechanical, not
 * editorial: those four are exactly the members that reach
 * `ObjectMetricWidget`'s `fetchMetric` / `computeOne` (`dataSource` gates the
 * effect; `aggregateKey`, `resolvedFilterKey` and `compareToKey` are its other
 * dependencies), and the two left — `trend` and `drillDown` — reach neither.
 * They shape what is drawn AROUND the number once it exists: a STATIC badge
 * beside it, and a drawer opened by clicking it. Neither can change the number.
 *
 * ⇒ That is what the next slice inherits, and it is cheap to state: the two
 * PRESENTATION members of `object-metric`, `trend` and `drillDown`. They were
 * left together on purpose rather than one being swept in — `drillDown` does
 * issue a query of its own (the drawer's record list, off the same resolved
 * filter), so "reaches an adapter" would have been the wrong cut and is stated
 * here so the next reader does not have to re-derive why it was not used.
 *
 * TWO of the four pins PROMOTE pre-existing files, each read end to end before
 * being credited and each given the one row it was missing:
 *
 *   - `ObjectMetric.elementDataSource.test.tsx` (objectstack#6953) already drove
 *     the binding's `object` and `view` members through the real renderer, with
 *     an unresolvable `view` reporting rather than aggregating the whole object
 *     and a binding-less metric unchanged. What it did not have was the
 *     NEGATIVE direction, so this slice adds it: the view fixture's `columns`,
 *     `sort` and `pagination` are asserted absent from the aggregate call.
 *     Without that the pin would have been satisfied by a mapping that forwarded
 *     everything, which here would mean a metric silently ordered and paged by a
 *     list view's presentation settings.
 *   - `ObjectMetricWidget.compareTo.test.tsx` (objectui#3337) already asserted
 *     the `{ kind, dimension? }` member set — `kind` choosing both window and
 *     label on a quarter-scoped fixture where the two values disagree about
 *     each, `dimension` carried but inert, and the no-`compareTo` single-pass
 *     control. It drove `ObjectMetricWidget` directly, so this slice adds the
 *     row that mounts `type: 'object-metric'` through `SchemaRenderer`: the
 *     block's `ElementDataSourceGate` shell re-binds only `objectName` and
 *     `filter` and forwards the rest untouched, and that is now asserted rather
 *     than assumed. ⚠️ It is also why the file names the block at all — the
 *     locator requires it, and a docblock mention alone would have been the
 *     locator satisfied by prose rather than by behaviour.
 *
 * `aggregate` and `filter` share ONE new file,
 * `objectMetricQueryMembers-8071.test.tsx` — the shape slice 3 used for
 * `record-picker-label-placeholder-i18n.test.tsx` and slice 6 for the
 * chatter/discussion pair — because the two keys meet inside a single adapter
 * call and the assertions have to be written against each other to stay
 * independent: the `aggregate` rows author NO filter (so the bag comparison is
 * blind to the filter spelling), and the `filter` rows are the ones that pin it.
 *
 * Every other candidate was read end to end and rejected with a reason, not
 * dismissed on its greps: `public-block-binding-reach.test.tsx` states its own
 * narrowness — one question per block, "did any call carry the object name" —
 * and lists `aggregate` only as a plausible sample value;
 * `widget-dom-leak-sweep.test.tsx` is the DOM-attribute canary, where
 * `aggregate` is a stub returning `[]`; `ObjectMetricWidget.i18nLabel.test.tsx`
 * authors `aggregate`, `trend` and `drillDown` purely to make the drill-down
 * reachable, and its subject is `I18nLabel` resolution — crediting it for
 * `trend` or `drillDown` would have been slice 7's
 * `action-bodyShape-forward.test.tsx` mistake in a new place. The remaining
 * seven files that name `object-metric` do so in prose, in a membership list,
 * or in a designer-inspector fixture.
 *
 * ⚠️ Unchanged by this slice: `NEWLY_JUDGED_UNPINNED_MEMBERS` (no block it names
 * was touched) and `record:related_list.actions`, whose `NO_READ_SITE_TO_PIN`
 * reading was not re-measured here because this slice took a different block —
 * slice 7's measurement stands as the last one taken.
 *
 * ## 33 -> 31, the ninth slice, and the first multi-key block closed by halves
 *
 * objectui#8071's ninth slice takes what slice 8 left and named: the two
 * PRESENTATION members of `object-metric`, `trend` and `drillDown`, so the
 * ceiling follows to 31 in the same commit and the block drops out of
 * `MEMBER_PIN_EXEMPTIONS` entirely — the first block closed in TWO bites rather
 * than one, which is the shape every remaining block (`object-grid` 15,
 * `object-form` 7, `object-master-detail-form` 6) now has to be closed in.
 *
 * The cut is slice 8's, restated because it is the part that is easy to get
 * wrong: `drillDown` DOES issue a query of its own — the drawer's record list
 * runs off the same resolved filter — so "reaches an adapter" is not the line.
 * The line is `fetchMetric` / `computeOne`, the path that produces the NUMBER.
 * Neither of these two can change it; they shape what is drawn around it.
 *
 * BOTH pins are new files, and the measurement that decided it is worth
 * recording because it corrects the prior note rather than repeating it.
 * `ObjectMetricWidget.i18nLabel.test.tsx` was flagged for this slice as prior
 * art that "satisfies any mechanical locator for either" key. Re-measured here,
 * that is true only of a locator keyed on the KEY NAME: the file contains ZERO
 * occurrences of the string `object-metric` (control: `ObjectMetricWidget`
 * reads 15 in the same file), and `memberPinProblem` requires the BLOCK name
 * too, so this repo's own locator would have refused it. The substance of the
 * warning stands — it authors `trend` and `drillDown` purely to make the drill
 * reachable, and its subject is `I18nLabel` resolution — so it is left intact
 * rather than promoted. The only other file naming block AND key is
 * `ObjectMetricWidget.compareTo.test.tsx`, already the `compareTo` pin, which
 * never authors a `trend` prop at all: crediting it would have been slice 7's
 * `action-bodyShape-forward.test.tsx` mistake in a third place.
 *
 * ⚠️ `drillDown` is pinned on the members that ACT and deliberately not on the
 * ones that do not. When this slice landed, `ObjectMetricWidget` hand-rolled its
 * own drawer instead of using the shared `DrillDownDrawer`, so five members the
 * shared component honours had no read site here (`columns`, `maxRows`,
 * `target: 'navigate'`, `filter`, `mode`). That was filed (objectui#8970) rather
 * than frozen into the pin — the same choice slice 6 made for
 * `record:activity`'s filter members (objectui#8934), and for the same reason:
 * an assertion that a member is dead has to be deleted before anyone can make it
 * live.
 *
 * ⇒ That reason has since paid out. objectui#8970 routed the block through
 * `DrillDownDrawer`, and three of the five (`columns`, `maxRows`,
 * `target: 'navigate'`) now act; nothing had to be deleted to let them. They are
 * pinned on their effects in
 * `ObjectMetricWidget.drillRoutedToSharedDrawer-8970.test.tsx`. `filter` and
 * `mode` still have no read site — the shared drawer honours neither — and are
 * still not asserted, for the reason above.
 *
 * ⚠️ Unchanged by this slice: `NEWLY_JUDGED_UNPINNED_MEMBERS` (no block it names
 * was touched) and `record:related_list.actions`, whose `NO_READ_SITE_TO_PIN`
 * reading was not re-measured here either — slice 7's measurement still stands
 * as the last one taken.
 *
 * ⇒ The rule for every future slice of objectui#8071: delete the entry, register
 * the pin, and set this constant to the new count. Not to the new count plus
 * room.
