 * objectui#3955 — the REVERSE-POLARITY twin of objectui#3862, in the same
 * `useMemo` of the same file.
 *
 * `SchemaRenderer`'s visibility chain has six legs. The four `visible*` ones are
 * written `!evaluator.evaluateCondition(...)`; the `hidden` / `hiddenOn` pair is
 * not negated. `evaluateCondition` documents exactly ONE default for "there is
 * nothing here to evaluate": it returns `true`, meaning *visible/enabled*. Negated
 * that default lands on "shown", which is what "no gate" means anyway — benign.
 * Un-negated it means HIDE, so an empty predicate made the node disappear:
 *
 *   value                        | visible* legs | hidden / hiddenOn (before)
 *   ''                           | rendered      | HIDDEN
 *   '   ' (whitespace)           | rendered      | HIDDEN
 *   { dialect: 'cel', source: '' }| rendered     | HIDDEN
 *   null                         | rendered      | HIDDEN
 *   false                        | HIDDEN        | rendered
 *   true                         | rendered      | HIDDEN
 *
 * The `false` / `true` rows were already right — a declared verdict is honoured —
 * and the four "empty" rows were the defect, with the widest possible spelling in
 * front of them (`!== undefined`, so `hidden: null` counted too).
 *
 * Two things make this the generic-path defect rather than one renderer's, and
 * make it HARDER to diagnose than its `disabled` twin:
 *
 *   • the block runs in the `evaluatedSchema` useMemo with no type branch, so it
 *     covers EVERY node that renders through `SchemaRenderer`;
 *   • a greyed-out control is still on screen. A node that never rendered is
 *     indistinguishable from metadata that meant to hide it — the author sees
 *     "I wrote an empty `hidden` and the whole block vanished", with nothing on
 *     screen to attribute it to.
 *
 * `{ dialect, source: '' }` is not an exotic spelling: `@objectstack/spec`'s
 * `ExpressionInputSchema` normalizes every authored predicate into an envelope, so
 * "author left the predicate empty" compiles to exactly this.
 *
 * The fix reads core's ONE definition (`hasDeclaredPredicate`, objectui#3850's
 * ruling) rather than adding an Nth local `&& !== ''`, and it also brings the
 * fourth empty spelling — a blank-but-not-empty envelope `source`, objectui#3960 —
 * with it, since that widening happened in the same definition.
 *
 * ## What each case detects
 *
 *   • the empty shapes on `hidden` and on `hiddenOn` → the node RENDERS. THE
 *     defect. Each shape reaches "nothing to evaluate" by its own route (string
 *     identity, `trim()`, envelope `source` empty, envelope `source` blank), so
 *     each is an independent mutation detector.
 *   • non-predicate junk (`0`, `{}`, `[]`) → renders. Fail-open on junk, the
 *     posture every other gate now takes.
 *   • `hidden: true` / a holding expression / a holding CEL envelope → STILL
 *     hidden. Anti-mutation guards: "never hide anything" satisfies most of this
 *     file on its own, and these refuse it.
 *   • `hidden: false` → still rendered, and the key is not forwarded as a DOM
 *     prop (it is stripped in the destructure below `evaluatedSchema`), so "not
 *     hidden" cannot be confused with "hidden={false} reached the component".
 *   • precedence, both directions: an UNDECLARED `hidden` no longer
 *     short-circuits, so a declared `hiddenOn` is finally consulted — and a
 *     DECLARED `hidden` still wins over `hiddenOn`, which is the case that would
 *     stay green if someone "fixed" the defect by deleting the `hidden` leg.
 *   • the `visible*` legs still come FIRST and still keep `!== undefined`: their
 *     alias precedence is load-bearing and their `true` is benign (objectui#3850's
 *     ruling fenced them off deliberately).
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted before running)
 *
 * Restoring `newSchema.hidden !== undefined` / `hiddenOn !== undefined` must turn
 * RED exactly: every empty-shape case on both keys, the junk cases, and the
 * "undeclared `hidden` falls through to `hiddenOn`" precedence case (whose
 * `hiddenOn: false` becomes unreachable). Every `true` / `false` / expression /
 * envelope / `visible*` case stays GREEN — the change can only stop hiding a
 * node, never start.
 *
 * Reverting the objectui#3960 half alone (envelope blankness) turns RED only the
 * two blank-`source` rows on each key. Deleting either leg outright turns RED the
 * "a DECLARED `hidden` wins" case, which no other case here would catch.

/**

 * cast.
 *
 * The STRING form is different since objectui#7455 (ruled 2026-09-03):
 * `hidden` is declared `boolean | string`, so an expression-valued `hidden` is
 * authorable and the compiler is the right checker for it. Narrowing `hidden`
 * back to `boolean` makes the call sites below TS2322 -- and `tsc -p
 * tsconfig.test.json` (chained from this package's `type-check` script) is the
 * only thing that can see that; vitest cannot, because the annotation is erased
 * before a single case runs.
 *
 * The CEL ENVELOPE is declared too since objectui#7530 (ruled 2026-09-04,
 * option A, on all three keys at once): `hidden` is `boolean | ExpressionWire`,
 * where `ExpressionWire` is the string-or-envelope union `visibleWhen` already
 * carried, so the non-empty envelope pin below runs through this helper as
 * well. That its verdict is IDENTICAL to the string form's, on all three keys
 * and in both polarities, is `SchemaRenderer.predicateEnvelopeDeclared.test.tsx`.
