### Minor Changes

- 0db4fb3: html tier: a braced attribute value that is not strict JSON now draws a `inert-expression` warning instead of vanishing silently (objectui#6598)
  
  `interpretBrace` materializes strict-JSON values only; anything else — the
  single-quoted array every JSX author writes (`columns={['name','amount']}`),
  unquoted object keys, any JS expression — compiles to the deferred `{ $expr }`
  marker, and nothing downstream evaluates that marker: the html tier parses,
  never executes (ADR-0080), and no renderer consumes `$expr`. The value reached
  the renderer as an opaque object, defensive non-array/non-object reads degraded
  it to "not declared", and the author's binding vanished with zero diagnostics
  anywhere — a production page's `list-view` rendered its row count and toolbar
  with no data columns, through eight `columns` spellings (objectui#6598, moved
  from objectstack#12649). That is ADR-0078's prohibited parsed-but-silently-inert
  state.
  
  `validateTree` now emits a warning-severity `inert-expression` diagnostic when a
  declared input's value is the `$expr` marker, with the fix in the message: write
  the value as JSON (double-quoted strings and keys). Warning, not error, per the
  objectui#5709 posture for inert authored keys — pages keep compiling and
  rendering exactly as before; the silence is what changed. Escalating the
  severity, widening the accepted literal grammar (e.g. materializing
  single-quoted strings), and covering base props like `style` are contract
  decisions deliberately left on objectui#6598.
- 4703651: html tier: braced attribute values now materialize the JS literal subset — single-quoted strings and unquoted identifier keys work (objectui#6614)
  
  The html tier is the untrusted-safe DATA tier: source is parsed, never executed
  (ADR-0080), which makes it the only safe carrier for runtime AI- or
  tenant-authored pages. But `interpretBrace` accepted only strict JSON inside
  braces while the surface called itself JSX, so `columns={['name','amount']}` —
  the spelling every JSX author and every AI author writes by habit — compiled to
  the deferred `{ $expr }` marker that nothing downstream evaluates, and the
  author's whole data binding vanished at render. A production page's `list-view`
  rendered its row count and toolbar with zero data columns through eight
  `columns` spellings before the author gave up (objectui#6598, moved from
  objectstack#12649). That was a trap, not a contract.
  
  `interpretBrace` now materializes the JS **literal subset**. Exactly two
  widenings over JSON, and nothing else:
  
  1. **single-quoted strings**, in value position and in key position —
     `title={'Accounts'}`, `columns={['name','amount']}`, `{{'pageSize': 25}}`;
  2. **unquoted identifier object keys** — `options={{pageSize: 25}}`,
     `columns={[{field:'name',label:'Full Name'}]}`.
  
  Everything else JSON refuses is still refused, still compiles to `{ $expr }`,
  and still draws the warning-severity `inert-expression` diagnostic: trailing
  commas, comments, array holes, spreads, `undefined`/`NaN`/`Infinity`,
  `+1`/`.5`/`1.`/`0x1f`, template literals, and every genuine expression —
  identifiers, member access, calls, operators, ternaries. The subset contains no
  identifier lookup and no operator, so there is nothing in it to execute: this
  moves habitual spellings onto the materialized side, it does not move the
  boundary between data and code. An authored `__proto__` key becomes an ordinary
  own property, as `JSON.parse` gives it — never the prototype setter.
  
  Strict JSON is unchanged, structurally: `JSON.parse` still runs first and
  untouched, so any value it accepts takes byte-identically the path it always
  did, and the literal reader only ever sees input `JSON.parse` has already
  thrown on.
  
  The `inert-expression` message changed with the grammar. It used to advise
  "write it as JSON (double-quoted strings and keys)" and named
  `columns={['name','amount']}` as the wrong form — advice that would now send an
  author to edit working source. It names the accepted literal grammar instead.
  
  Maintainer ruling of 2026-08-28 (objectui#6614 Q1-A). ⛔ Two ruled items are
  deliberately NOT in this change: escalating `inert-expression` from warning to
  error (Q2 — it belongs at the save gate, once the framework wires the registry
  manifest into `validate-jsx-pages`), and base-prop (`style`) `$expr` inertness
  (Q3 — sequenced after this, so no warning is added for spellings this change
  legalises).
- cf1d29e: `ComponentInput.of` — the coarse kind of an input's MEMBERS, with readers on day one
  (objectui#8067).
  
  A registration's `type: 'array'` said a value was a list and stopped there, so a member
  that drifted from `@objectstack/spec` was invisible to every layer that reads a
  declaration. `page:header.actions` is the measured cost: the contract declares
  `z.array(z.string())` ("Action IDs"), the renderer read the members as `ActionDef`
  objects, and the repo-wide parity gate in
  `apps/console/src/__tests__/registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts` stayed green for the
  whole life of the drift because both sides carried the key and neither could say what
  was inside it. What settled it was a maintainer ruling, not a test — and even after the
  fix, "these are ids" survived only as English in the registration's `description`.
  
  **What is new.** `ComponentInput` gains an optional `of`, carrying the same coarse-kind
  vocabulary as `type` one level down: the ELEMENTS of an `array`, or the VALUES of an
  `object` used as a map. One kind, or an array of them for a member contract that is a
  union, with `type`'s semantics — a member passes when any declared arm accepts it. The
  manifest serializer forwards it, so `sdui.manifest.json` now carries seven keys per
  input instead of six.
  
  **Three readers ship with it**, which was the bar this slot had to clear (objectui#5905
  is the precedent: five `ComponentInput` keys declared and read by nothing). The
  repo-wide parity gate compares every declared `of` against the member kind
  `ComponentPropsMap[type]` actually accepts and fails on one the contract refuses;
  `sdui-parser`'s `validateTree` reports a member that fits no declared kind, as a new
  `member-type-mismatch` diagnostic naming the offending positions; and the generated
  `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts` narrows the authoring type — `page:header`'s `actions` is
  `string[]` where it used to be `unknown[]`.
  
  **Fifteen keys now declare one**, across ten blocks, each DERIVED rather than chosen:
  every container key's member position was probed with one value of each coarse kind and
  a declaration written only where exactly one kind was accepted. A member contract that
  admits several kinds — `record:highlights.fields` takes a field name or an inline field
  object — is deliberately left undeclared and pinned with its reason, because picking one
  arm there is a narrowing this repo leaves un-gated and picking all of them would
  advertise shapes only a per-block pin can vouch for.
  
  **The ceiling is unchanged.** `of` is a KIND and never a value domain, so the maintainer
  ruling of 2026-08-17 quoted on `ComponentInput.type` — the coarse arm plus `description`
  is the publication face's expression ceiling, and spec is the sole judge of values —
  stands exactly as written. `of: 'object'` says the members are objects; which keys they
  carry is still `description`'s job and `os validate`'s.
  
  **Nothing published before this changes.** An input that declares no `of` validates,
  serializes and types byte-identically: `validateTree` checks no member, the serializer
  emits no key, and the codegen emits the same `unknown[]`.
- 8d58f46: `validateTree` now reports a dashboard widget `options` key that no renderer
  consumes as a `unconsumed-widget-option` **warning** naming the consumed set
  (objectui#5709 ruling). The census behind the accepted set — the spec's five
  declared query keys (`dateGranularity`, `sortBy`, `sortOrder`, `limit`,
  `stageOrder`) plus the `description` sub-caption convention key — is
  re-measured on every test run against `@objectstack/spec` and the
  `plugin-dashboard` renderer sources. The check fires only on dataset-bound
  shorthand widgets (the spec-legal form) hosted by `dashboard` /
  `dashboard-grid` nodes, and honours the spec's per-widget
  `suppressWarnings: ['unconsumed-widget-option']` escape hatch. Warning
  severity only: documents keep parsing, saving and rendering. Exported for
  other surfaces: `checkDashboardWidgetOptions`, `CONSUMED_WIDGET_OPTION_KEYS`,
  `DASHBOARD_WIDGET_HOST_TYPES`, `UNCONSUMED_WIDGET_OPTION`.

### Patch Changes

- 0b1326d: Documentation no longer teaches the "JSX/HTML + Tailwind" framing for a page's
  `source`, which ADR-0080's own 2026-06-30 header amendment (under ADR-0065,
  Accepted) retracted. objectui#5461 corrected three sites; a multiline census
  found eight more, in three spellings a line-oriented grep could not see.
  
  A page's `source` is *runtime metadata*. The console's Tailwind is compiled at
  build time by scanning the console's own `src`, and there is no safelist, so it
  never sees your page: an authored utility class produces CSS only by coincidence
  (when objectui already ships that exact class) and otherwise produces nothing,
  with no error anywhere. That is the ADR-0065 "works only by coincidence" failure
  mode, and it is how a modal's `bg-black/50` backdrop reached production fully
  transparent. `os validate` reports it as `page-source-className-tailwind`, a
  warning on kinds `html`, `react` and `jsx`, shipped in `@objectstack/lint@11.5.0`.
  
  The tiers themselves are unchanged and every load-bearing claim survives —
  parse-never-execute, the untrusted-author safety argument for `html`, and the
  deprecated `'jsx'` alias. Only the styling primitive is corrected, to the wording
  `content/docs/guide/react-pages.md` §Styling already uses:
  
  | `kind` | Style with |
  |---|---|
  | `"html"` | The blocks' own structured props (`` `<flex direction gap>` ``, `` `<grid columns>` ``) plus a JSON `style` object. |
  | `"react"` | Inline `style` objects. |
  
  Colors on both tiers come from the theme as `hsl(var(--token))`.
  
  Why each package has an entry — each was measured against its built artefact, not
  assumed:
  
  - **`@object-ui/react-runtime`**: `README.md` is published to npm (npm includes
    `README.md` in the tarball regardless of `files`). Its "no sandbox" callout is
    the paragraph that routes untrusted-author work to the `html` tier, and it
    carried the retracted framing line-wrapped across `:17-18`. It also gains the
    §Styling section it was missing — the absence is why the framing survived here.
  - **`@object-ui/sdui-parser`**: the corrected header of `src/types.ts` projects
    verbatim into the published `dist/types.d.ts`.
  - **`@object-ui/components`**: the corrected header of
    `src/renderers/basic/html-elements.tsx` projects verbatim into the published
    `dist/renderers/basic/html-elements.d.ts`. The `kind === 'html'` dispatch-arm
    comment in `src/renderers/layout/page.tsx` does **not** project (it is inside a
    function body) and is included here only because the same package already owes
    an entry.
  
  No behaviour change: this is prose only. `CHANGELOG.md` occurrences are
  deliberately untouched — immutable release history.
- 305205a: `kind:'html'` page sources keep the space between a text run and an adjacent
  inline element: `A <strong>x</strong> page` now compiles to `A `/`<strong>`/`
  page` and renders as `A x page` rather than `Axpage` (objectui#5661).
  
  The parser collapsed each text run's whitespace to a single space — correct, and
  what HTML itself does — and then `.trim()`ed it, which is not: HTML collapses a
  whitespace run to one space, it does not delete it. The deleted space was
  precisely the separator between a run and its inline sibling, so every authored
  sentence carrying emphasis or a link in the tier the guide recommends by default
  rendered with its words run together. It was silent: the page rendered, the
  structure was right, no diagnostic fired.
  
  The rule is deliberately mechanical rather than a block/inline taxonomy invented
  for a schema tree that has none: keep one leading space when a sibling precedes
  the run, and one trailing space when a sibling element follows it. The parent's
  own start and end still drop their edge space, so `<p>  hi  </p>` is unchanged.
  
  Its one bounded cost: a whitespace-only run BETWEEN two siblings survives as a
  single space, so a pretty-printed `<ul>` gains one `' '` string child per gap
  between its `<li>`s — one space per gap, never the source's newline and
  indentation, never at the container's own edges, and never inside an item's own
  text. That bound is pinned by a test rather than left as a claim.

## 17.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 279fb13: `ComponentInput.type` can declare a UNION, so a block stops warning about legal
  writes its own description recommends
  
  A registration's `type` was one coarse control kind, while a good number of spec
  keys accept more than one shape. A declaration therefore had to pick an arm, and
  the repo's own manifest gate then reported `type-mismatch` on the other arm's
  legal values. Four of the five measured cases were the loud shape: the input's
  `description` teaches the author to write an inline translation map
  (`{ en, "zh-CN", … }`) while the same input's `type: 'string'` made
  `sdui-parser`'s `checkType` warn about exactly that map — one platform authority
  contradicting itself on the write it had just recommended. Because these land at
  warning severity the page still compiled and rendered; the cost is that noise on
  correct authoring trains authors, AI authors included, to dismiss the
  `unknown-prop` and `type-mismatch` reports that are real.
  
  `type` now accepts an ARRAY of coarse kinds as well as a single one (maintainer
  ruling on objectui#3832, direction (a)), and a value passes the coarse check when
  ANY declared arm accepts it. Both declaration sites in `@object-ui/types` move
  together with the registry's own copy in `@object-ui/core`, and
  `ComponentInputSchema` enforces the same widening — a non-empty array of
  DISTINCT kinds, so an empty arm list or a repeated arm is refused at authoring
  time rather than normalized behind the author's back.
  
  Five declarations now spell their real contract, and the `type-mismatch` warning
  on each of these legal writes is gone:
  
  - `page:header.title`, `page:header.subtitle`, `page:card.title` —
    string **or** inline translation map (the spec's union, measured against
    `ComponentPropsMap` at the pinned rc.6; the renderers resolve both through
    `pickLocalized`);
  - `record:alert.title`, `record:alert.body` — the same two shapes, justified
    against the RENDERER since the pinned spec carries no `record:alert` props
    schema;
  - `element:text_input.defaultValue` — `string | number`, the spec's union,
    which had been narrowed to `'string'` with the number arm named only in prose.
  
  **Backward compatible, and measured as such.** The single-kind form stays valid
  and is still the canonical spelling for a one-arm key: it validates identically
  (the diagnostics for one arm, `invalid-enum` and its `error` severity included,
  are byte-identical), and `manifestFromConfigs` collapses a one-element array back
  to the bare string, so every entry already in a published `sdui.manifest.json`
  serializes unchanged and arrays appear only where a union was really declared.
  The JSX authoring surface follows in the same step — `generateDts` emits a
  TypeScript union for a union input, so the `.d.ts` an author type-checks against
  accepts exactly what the gate accepts.
  
  A union widens what is legal; it does not switch the check off. A value matching
  NO declared arm is still reported, a multi-arm mismatch reports at its strictest
  arm's severity (`error` when an `enum` arm is present, so an enum's closed list
  does not become dismissible by having a second arm added next to it), and arms
  are meant to match the contract rather than relax the gate:
  `element:text_input.defaultValue` deliberately gains no `object` arm because the
  spec rejects a map there, and `element:record_picker.emptyText` keeps its single
  `'string'` arm because that renderer drops the map form (objectui#4163) — an arm
  the renderer never honours would advertise a shape that cannot reach the screen.

### Patch Changes

- 40d3a33: `div` 的废弃提示按 provenance 收窄:只对 **JSON 作者面**的节点报,不再对 `kind:'html'` tier 自己解析出的节点开火。
  
  html tier 的页面是一段受限 JSX/Tailwind 文本,由引擎自己的解析器编译(只解析、不执行),标签名原样映射成节点 —— 作者在那一层写下的盒子标签,是该 tier 词表里的一等成员,**没有别的拼法可迁移**。提示照旧对他们开火,给的还是 JSON 作者面的替代建议:一条谁都无法执行的提示不是废弃,是噪声;它同时意味着这个类型永远退不掉,因为引擎自己的编译器一直在产出它。
  
  判据是**来源**,由生产者确立:解析器给它产出的每个节点打一个 symbol 标记(`Symbol.for` 注册键),渲染器读这个标记。symbol 对 `JSON.stringify` / `Object.keys` / DOM 全部不可见 —— 所以它既不会落进被持久化的文档,也就无法被一份(手写或 AI 生成的)JSON 元数据复制回来给自己买到豁免;通过花括号属性夹带进来的 JSON **不打标记**,那部分本来就是手写的,建议对它成立。
  
  迁移建议一字未改,JSON 作者面照旧每次模块加载报一次;提示文案现在写明它针对哪一个作者面。

### Minor Changes

- 4a51e77: Stop declaring 14 symbols across ten packages under names `@objectstack/spec`
  owns (objectui#3161, objectstack#4115 batch 7 — the long tail, one or two
  entries per package). All ten packages leave the ledger, which drops from 17
  collisions across 11 packages to 3 across 1.

  **Renamed exports** — in every case the spec exports the same name for a
  _different_ thing, so the old name was a mis-description rather than a dialect:

  | package                    | was                                | now                                                  | what the spec's same-named export is                                                                                                       |

  `ManifestValidationResult` follows the `<what was validated>Validation<Error|Result>`
  convention registered on objectstack#4115 (`@object-ui/core` took
  `SchemaNodeValidationResult` in batch 4). `PageHeaderComponentProps` deliberately
  reuses the name `@object-ui/app-shell` already chose for its own header props in
  batch 3, so one concept does not acquire two dialect names one package apart.

  **Now derived from the spec instead of hand-written:**

  - `@object-ui/fields` — `isFileIdToken` is re-exported from
    `@objectstack/spec/data`. The local copy was character-for-character identical
    to the spec's function while its comment said it "mirrors" it, so every
    behaviour test passed and only reference identity could tell the two apart.
    The regex is a wire decision: widening it server-side while a copy here kept
    the old bound would make every new id read as "not a reference", and the
    widget would submit the legacy inline blob to a backend expecting a reference.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail` — `FeedFilterMode` is re-exported from
    `@objectstack/spec/data`, in a file that already imported the sibling
    `FeedItemType` from the spec.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-grid` — the eleven-member aggregation union is now the
    spec's `ColumnSummary` enum, so the total `Record<ColumnSummaryType, string>`
    label map turns a member the spec adds into a compile error instead of a
    blank footer cell. `ColumnSummarySetting` is `NonNullable<ListColumn['summary']>`,
    i.e. whatever forms the spec itself accepts. `hasMultiValueShape` delegates to
    the spec's `isMultiValueField` rather than re-deriving it from
    `MULTI_OPTION_TYPES` / `MULTI_CAPABLE_TYPES`.
  - `@object-ui/providers` — `ThemePreference` is the spec's `ThemeMode` union
    plus the one legacy `'system'` spelling this provider still honours for stored
    preferences, read off the schema's own `_zod` carrier so the package takes no
    zod dependency.

  `@objectstack/spec` moves from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in
  `@object-ui/fields` (it re-exports a runtime function) and `@object-ui/providers`
  (its public `.d.ts` now references the spec).

  Scored `minor`, not `major`, per this repo's fixed-group rule — objectui's major
  tracks `@objectstack`, so breaking changes of our own ship as minor with the
  semantics spelled out above (see AGENTS.md §版本号策略). A `major` here would carry
  all 39 packages of the fixed group to `18.0.0` and off objectstack's 17.x line.

### Patch Changes

- cc70b8f: A declared `objectName` must reach the data layer — the evidence the framework's spec↔registry check cannot gather (objectstack#4472).

  The framework diffs `sdui.manifest.json` against the spec's zod schemas and, while that
  check was named `check:react-conformance`, it was read — by its own file header — as
  confirming these components "ACTUALLY implement" the spec's props. It never could. Both
  sides of that diff are **declarations**, and this repo produces one of them:
  `manifestFromConfigs` copies `config.inputs` verbatim and cannot observe whether the
  renderer behind a block reads any of them. So a prop both sides declare and nothing
  consumes reads there as agreement — which is how objectstack#4413's four `record:*` blocks
  published an `objectName`/`recordId` no renderer read, rendered blank, and stayed green.

  Evidence about the render path has to be taken from the render path, so it lives here now.
  `apps/console/src/__tests__/public-block-binding-reach.test.tsx` mounts every public block
  that declares an `objectName` input through `SchemaRenderer` with nothing but that binding,
  under a provider whose `dataSource` is a Proxy recording every call, and asserts some call
  carried the object name. Deliberately narrow — "is this binding wired", not "is every
  declared input consumed", which is not decidable from outside without heuristics. Every
  non-reaching block carries a written reason in a ledger asserted to equal the observed set
  in **both** directions, so a block that starts binding forces its entry deleted and a block
  that stops binding fails; the suite was verified to go red both ways.

  First run: five of eight bound blocks reach the data layer, three do not.
  `record:related_list` legitimately declines to fetch without the parent record id from
  `RecordContext` (already documented in @objectstack/spec's objectstack#4413 ledger).
  `list-view` and `embeddable-form` do not, and that is a real defect of the same shape —
  neither registration bridges the schema-renderer context onto the component's `dataSource`
  prop the way `object-form` / `object-kanban` / `object-calendar` do, and `SchemaRenderer`
  never injects it, so on the registry/SDUI path both render an empty shell while declaring
  `objectName` **required**. Filed as objectui#3144 rather than fixed here: giving them a
  data source changes what they render everywhere they are mounted bare.

  `manifestFromConfigs` and `scripts/dump-public-manifest.mjs` now say in their own docs that
  what they emit is what a registration _declared_, never what a renderer reads.

### Minor Changes

- 32462dd: feat(sdui): guard the public contract against silent drift — coverage test + manifest lazy-stub assertion

  Follow-up to objectui#2953. That bug — every lazily-registered public block
  missing from the contract, and so from every `kind:'react'` page's scope —
  survived because nothing compared `PUBLIC_BLOCKS` against what an app actually
  registers. Type-check, lint, build and the whole suite stayed green while seven
  curated blocks were unusable. Two guards close that class.

  **Console ↔ contract coverage.** `apps/console/src/register-plugins.ts` extracts
  the plugin registration out of `main.tsx` so it can be imported without booting
  the app. A new `apps/console/src/__tests__/public-contract.test.ts` reads that
  real list and pins, as exact lists, which curated tags the console exposes (35),
  which are still unimplemented (`line_items`), and which reach the contract
  through a pending lazy stub. Exact lists rather than `toContain`, because the
  failure mode is a _shrinking_ contract. Reverting the #2953 fix drops coverage
  from 35 to 28 and fails all four assertions.

  **Manifests must be generated from loaded registrations.** New exported
  `assertFullyLoaded(configs)` in `@object-ui/sdui-parser`, plus `lazy?: boolean`
  on `RegistryConfigLike`. A lazy stub carries metadata but no `inputs`, so it
  would be written into `sdui.manifest.json` as a block that takes no props —
  making every prop an author passes it an `unknown-prop` diagnostic in the save
  gate. Both generators now assert instead: `gen-manifest.ts` throws, and
  `dev/manifest-dump.tsx` also imports the console's real registration list, so a
  plugin the console lazy-registers but the dump forgets to import eagerly is
  caught rather than silently emitted propless. `scripts/dump-public-manifest.mjs`
  surfaces that failure instead of timing out for 120s with no message.

  Also documents `object-chart` as a seventh block affected by objectui#2953 —
  the issue listed six.

### Minor Changes

- 9e7a986: ADR-0080: AI-authored UI pages. New `@object-ui/sdui-parser` compiles a constrained JSX/HTML+Tailwind source into the SchemaNode tree (parse, never execute) with whitelist sanitization, manifest validation, and `.d.ts` codegen for the JSX type surface. `PageRenderer` renders `kind:'jsx'` pages; `ComponentRegistry` gains `tier` + `getPublicConfigs()` (capability vs contract).
