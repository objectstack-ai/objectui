/**
 * ObjectUI — unconsumed dashboard-widget `options` keys (objectui#5709)
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s `DashboardWidgetOptionsSchema` ends in `.passthrough()`
 * ("declared query keys + open renderer extras"), so ANY key parses, validates
 * and lints cleanly — including one no renderer reads. That is how a showcase
 * dashboard shipped `options: { invert: true }` on a gauge with a comment
 * saying what it was believed to do, and rendered the un-inverted measure with
 * no diagnostic anywhere (objectui#5709). The 2026-08-23 maintainer ruling:
 * open extras stay open — they just stop being SILENT. A key that reaches no
 * renderer draws a WARNING naming the consumed set. Not an error: no gate
 * weakening and no new red gates were ruled.
 *
 * ## The census (measured on origin/main @ 8689166f6, spec 17.1.0)
 *
 * The spec REQUIRES `dataset` on every widget (`DashboardWidgetSchema` —
 * re-read for objectui#7293 against the PUBLISHED `@objectstack/spec@17.4.0`,
 * whose required keys are exactly `id` / `dataset` / `values`), and
 * both dashboard surfaces route a dataset-bound widget to `DatasetWidget`
 * (`DashboardRenderer.tsx` renders `<DatasetWidget>` when `widget.dataset` is
 * set; `DashboardGridLayout.tsx` mirrors the fork, objectui#4614). On that —
 * the only spec-legal — path, the renderer-consumed `options` keys are exactly
 * the five the spec DECLARES, all read as direct `options.<key>` accesses in
 * `packages/plugin-dashboard/src/DatasetWidget.tsx`:
 *
 *   dateGranularity, sortBy, sortOrder, limit   (query-affecting, framework#3588)
 *   stageOrder                                  (funnel/pyramid stage order)
 *
 * plus ONE undeclared key with a real read site:
 *
 *   description — the metric-card sub-caption channel. Read at
 *   `widgetSubCaption.ts` (`(widget.options as …)?.description`, objectui#4032
 *   item 4 — that read sat inline in `DashboardRenderer.tsx` until
 *   objectui#8889 moved it, verbatim, into the hook BOTH dashboard surfaces
 *   now call, so the authored and bundle channels compose at one decision
 *   point) and, since objectui#7293, at `DatasetWidget.tsx`'s
 *   metric branch, which renders it in the caption row; the server's
 *   `translateDashboard` OVERLAYS the `widgets.{id}.subCaption` translation
 *   onto this key (objectstack#8056, objectstack#5428 item-4: 「两个作者字段两个
 *   key」). It entered the accepted set on the translation-pipeline evidence
 *   alone — warning on a key the platform's own pipeline writes would be a
 *   false positive on legal metadata — while the dataset-bound render path
 *   displayed it nowhere. #7293 closed that gap, so `description` is now
 *   accepted for the same reason as the declared five and the accepted set no
 *   longer outruns the measured read set.
 *
 * Notably NOT consumed on the path a widget really renders through:
 * `thresholds` and `format`. Both were widely believed to work; both draw this
 * warning, which is the point. They are NOT the same kind of claim, and since
 * the 2026-08-25 maintainer ruling (batch adjudication close-out, decision B1 —
 * a closure claim must be BOUNDED or DERIVABLE, and a claim written in two
 * places is single-sourced) they are written separately (objectui#6186):
 *
 *   `thresholds` — zero read sites repo-wide. This paragraph is the CANONICAL
 *     statement of that closure claim. `content/docs/plugins/plugin-dashboard.mdx`
 *     used to assert it a second time in its own words; two copies of one
 *     closure claim drift apart independently and neither knows when the other
 *     stopped being true, so the page now POINTS here rather than restating it.
 *     Single-sourcing is what makes this copy load-bearing, so it is DERIVED
 *     rather than trusted:
 *     `scripts/__tests__/unconsumed-widget-option-claim-6186.test.ts` re-scans
 *     every JS/TS file git tracks for an access to a key of that name and fails
 *     if one appears. Land a renderer that reads it and this module goes red in
 *     the same run.
 *   `format` — not read ON THE DATASET-BOUND PATH; the value is formatted with
 *     the MEASURE's own metadata (`measureField(...).format`, from the dataset
 *     definition), not from the widget's bag. Deliberately a BOUNDED claim and
 *     not a repo-wide one: `format` is a live key in other vocabularies, so a
 *     repo-wide scan would red on a TRUE claim — and an assertion that reds on
 *     legitimate code gets deleted by the next person who hits it, which puts
 *     the claim back where it started. Leg 2 of
 *     `__tests__/dashboard-widget-options-census.test.ts` derives exactly this
 *     bound: the DatasetWidget read set is the declared set plus the
 *     sub-caption key, and neither `format` nor `thresholds` is in it. Since
 *     objectui#7293 that absence is asserted in its OWN right rather than
 *     riding on an equality whose right-hand side can grow.
 *
 * ## Scope — where the warning deliberately does NOT fire
 *
 *   - Widgets WITHOUT `dataset`: the legacy inline forms (`options.data`
 *     arrays, `provider: 'object'` bags) consume a much larger, spread-shaped
 *     key set (`{ ...options }` into `metric` / `object-metric` /
 *     `data-table` / …), whose true reach is each child component's prop
 *     surface. That form is spec-illegal today (`dataset` is required) and its
 *     census would be the unmaintainable one; skipping it keeps every warning
 *     this module emits a statement about the path the widget actually renders
 *     through.
 *   - Widgets in the legacy COMPONENT format (`widget.component`): `options`
 *     is not part of that contract.
 *   - Widgets carrying the spec's own escape hatch
 *     `suppressWarnings: ['unconsumed-widget-option']` — the spec models
 *     per-widget diagnostic suppression (`DashboardWidgetSchema`), so an
 *     author with a genuine out-of-band consumer can say so in metadata.
 *
 * ## Maintenance — how this list stays true
 *
 * `__tests__/dashboard-widget-options-census.test.ts` re-runs the census on
 * every test run: it re-derives the five declared keys from the installed
 * `@objectstack/spec`, re-extracts the `options.<key>` reads from
 * `DatasetWidget.tsx` source text (and fails loudly if that file gains a
 * consumption shape the extractor cannot see — a spread, a destructuring, a
 * computed access), re-checks the sub-caption read site, and trips on any NEW
 * file in `packages/*\/src` or `apps/*\/src` that starts reading
 * `widget.options`. A renderer change that adds or removes a consumed key
 * fails that test until this list is updated — the cost of keeping this
 * warning honest is editing ONE array below plus re-reading the census notes.
