/**
 * Data pillar — Validations view.
 *
 * Edits `ObjectSchema.validations` (spec `ValidationRuleSchema`, a discriminated
 * union on `type`). Every rule type in the spec is authorable here — not just
 * `script` — so the no-code surface is a faithful config panel for the metadata:
 *
 *   - script        — a CEL FAIL predicate (TRUE ⇒ the write is rejected).
 *   - cross_field   — a CEL predicate plus the participating fields.
 *   - state_machine — a status field + allowed from→to transitions.
 *   - format        — a field + a built-in format or a regex pattern.
 *   - json_schema   — a JSON field validated against a JSON Schema.
 *   - conditional   — a CEL guard + a nested rule applied when it holds.
 *
 * Adding a rule starts from the "New" menu, which opens on a few common rules in
 * plain words (objectui#11861, `validationPresets.ts`) and keeps every spec type
 * under "Advanced" — see "Starting points" below. A new rule starts on
 * Create + Update (objectui#11820). A type whose rule carries a CEL guard
 * (`script`, `cross_field`, `conditional`) is NOT written to the object draft
 * until the author gives it a condition — see "A new rule waits for its
 * condition" below. The other types are written at once, each seeded with a
 * VALID skeleton so the object-draft save never 422s. The common fields
 * (name / label / message / severity / events / priority / active) are shared
 * by all types; the type-specific fields render below them. CEL conditions
 * reuse the metadata-admin `ConditionBuilder`, fed the DRAFT field list so
 * unpublished fields are pickable.
 *
 * Persistence: like actions, validations live ON the object draft — this panel
 * calls `onPatch({ validations })` and the Data pillar's Save draft owns the
 * write. Nothing here fetches or saves on its own.
 *
 * ## A new rule waits for its condition (objectui#11820)
 *
 * A guard-bearing rule used to be written at once with the placeholder guard
 * `'false'`: the draft autosave stored a rule that can never fire, and nothing
 * on screen said so. Now the new rule is held HERE, in the panel, until its
 * guard is non-empty (for `conditional`, its `then` rule's guard too). It is
 * listed and editable like any rule, marked as not saved, and the editor shows
 * the line the Data pillar uses for an edit it holds (objectui#11786,
 * `engine.studio.held.line`) plus that hold's input hint under the guard. The
 * first edit that gives it a guard writes it to the draft; from then on it is an
 * ordinary rule.
 *
 * Why the panel and not the pillar's hold: the pillar holds a draft its write
 * guard would refuse (`objectHeldEdit` in `metadataError.ts`) and routes "Show
 * me" to a field. A rule that has never been written is not an edit of that
 * draft, and nothing it needs lives in the draft yet. The known cost, which the
 * pillar's hold does not have: leaving the Rules view, or the object, before the
 * rule has a condition drops it, and Publish does not wait for it (it was never
 * in the draft, and the line says it is not saved).
 *
 * An EXISTING rule is edited exactly as before, including a type switch, which
 * still seeds the `'false'` placeholder: a rule already in the draft must stay
 * saveable while it is being reshaped.
 *
 * ## Starting points (objectui#11861)
 *
 * "New" opens on the presets of `validationPresets.ts` — each a rule of a type
 * the spec already has, labelled by what it does rather than by its type — and
 * the per-type list, unchanged, under "Advanced". A preset is applied through
 * the same door as a type: the new-rule skeleton, then the keys the preset
 * fills. So the hold above covers it as it covers any new rule: a preset that
 * fills its condition from the object's fields is written at once, and one that
 * leaves it empty is held, and opens with the condition editor focused. A preset
 * whose fields the object lacks is listed disabled, saying what it needs.

          said the draft-level validator for THIS surface already runs
          `scope: 'record'`. It does not: `clientValidation`'s
          `validateObjectFieldRules` lints `visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` /
          `requiredWhen` and `formula` expressions — a sibling surface, which
          is the word the filing card itself uses. Nothing validates a
          validation rule's `condition` at draft level at all. The server
          binding above is the reason, and it is the stronger one.

          The counter-datum, recorded so it is not re-discovered as an
          objection: `ObjectValidationEngine.scopeFor` in `@object-ui/core`
          binds the bare field names AND `record`. That engine is deprecated
          and deliberately unwired — `validation-engine-stays-unwired.test.ts`
          reddens if a production module imports it — so it is not an
          authority on what an author should type. */}
