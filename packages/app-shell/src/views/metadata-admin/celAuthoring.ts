/**
 * Author-time CEL safety for the RLS policy editor (objectui#2413).
 *
 * Row-Level Security `USING` (read filter) / `CHECK` (write filter) predicates
 * are the highest-risk authoring surface in the permission model: a typo in a
 * predicate silently produces the wrong row scope, and some evaluation paths
 * FAIL OPEN — a malformed read filter can WIDEN access with no visible error.
 * Yet the editor shipped as a bare `<textarea>` with zero validation.
 *
 * This module is the thin bridge from the editor to the framework's canonical
 * CEL engine, `@objectstack/formula` — the SAME parser/validator the server and
 * the `validate_expression` agent tool use — so the GUI, SDK, and CLI reach the
 * identical verdict rather than maintaining a second grammar (ADR-0032). It
 * exposes exactly the four author-time affordances the editors need:
 *
 *   1. {@link lintCelPredicate}    — parse/field lint (surfaced inline as you type).
 *   2. {@link introspectCelScope}  — the valid field + scope identifiers (autocomplete).
 *   3. {@link testRunCelPredicate} — dry-run a predicate against a sample record.
 *   4. {@link inferCelValueType}   — the value type a formula computes (objectui#1582 follow-up).
 *
 * Progressive enhancement (mirrors `preview/capabilityLint.ts`): the engine is
 * loaded LAZILY via dynamic `import()` — it carries the CEL parser (cel-js), so
 * keeping it out of the main bundle matters and this rare admin surface is the
 * right place to pay that cost. Every entry point FEATURE-DETECTS the function
 * it needs and SWALLOWS any failure (import, missing export, throw): author-time
 * assistance must NEVER break or block the editor. A missing engine degrades to
 * "no lint / no suggestions / test-run unavailable", never to an exception.

/**
 * The wrong-layer `data.*` advisory — why it is wired HERE, and why it is only
 * an advisory (objectui#8972).
 *
 * ## What it closes
 *
 * `@objectstack/formula`'s `SCOPE_ROOTS` carries `data`, so at `scope: 'record'`
 * the engine lint ACCEPTS `data.status == 'x'` with zero findings (measured on
 * `@objectstack/formula@17.4.0`). objectui#5741 retired that spelling on runtime
 * record surfaces and objectui#8166 stopped this tier binding an ambient `data`,
 * so the predicate now faults at runtime with `Unknown variable: data` — but the
 * author still gets a GREEN lint while typing it. That gap is the whole card:
 * the diagnostic arrives at misbehaviour time instead of at typing time.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a re-run of the warning objectui#5741 deleted
 *
 * That ruling removed the Phase-1 warning from the runtime hot path and kept
 * the export, in its own words, "as the offline instrument". `listConditional.ts`
 * records the same split: the detector "stays exported for OFFLINE sweeps of
 * authored metadata, not for this hot path". This call site is neither the hot
 * path nor a render — it is the editor bridge, classifying authored text as the
 * author types it, which is the sweep case one document at a time. Nothing is
 * added back to `evalRowPredicate` / `listConditional.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why WARNING and never ERROR
 *
 * An `error` here would narrow the accepted set: every save gate on this tier
 * counts `severity === 'error'` (`ConditionalFormattingEditor`,
 * `ObjectFieldInspector`, `ConditionBuilder`, `PermissionAdvancedFacets`,
 * `clientValidation.validateObjectFieldRules`), so promoting this would refuse
 * predicates already stored in customer metadata. A `warning` leaves
 * `aria-invalid` unset and every gate open. Narrowing the ACCEPT SET is the
 * producer-side half and lives in `@objectstack/formula` (objectui#8166's
 * ruling); adding an advisory the engine never had is not that change.
 *
 * ## Why only ONE of the detector's two arms is consulted
 *
 * The detector also reports the bare shorthand, and that arm is deliberately
 * disabled here by passing `row = null` (the arm requires an own key of the
 * row). Measured, both directions:
 *
 *  - at `scope: 'record'` the engine ALREADY errors on a bare identifier and
 *    names the `record.<field>` fix, so the arm can only duplicate it;
 *  - at `scope: 'flattened'` — RLS `USING` / `CHECK` — a bare identifier is the
 *    CORRECT spelling (`organization_id == current_user.organization_id` is the
 *    editor's own placeholder). All three genuine RLS predicates in this repo
 *    fire that arm, i.e. it is a 100% false positive rate on that tier.
 *
 * `dataNamesRow` is passed `true` because what that guard actually decides — in
 * its own words, "a surface whose `data` is the host scope's own … is a
 * legitimate `data.*` site and is left alone" — is whether `data` is legitimate
 * here. On a record-scope authoring site it is not: `ROW_PREDICATE_ROOTS`,
 * `FIELD_RULE_ROOTS` and `FORMULA_ROOTS` all exclude it and `buildExpressionScope`
 * binds nothing under it. The metadata-editing layer where `data` IS canonical
 * (ADR-0089 D3) is `views/metadata-admin/SchemaForm.tsx`, which evaluates through
 * `views/metadata-admin/predicate.ts` and never reaches this function — which is
 * why the gate below is `scope === 'record'` and not a source pattern.
