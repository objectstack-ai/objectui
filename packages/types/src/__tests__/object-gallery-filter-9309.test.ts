 *
 * objectui#9309 — `ObjectGallerySchema.filter` is typed as the destination its
 * own docblock names, on both faces; and the `filter` census that sentence used
 * to be argued from is re-derived here instead of written down.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The declaration read `filter?: unknown` under the docblock "Query filter,
 * forwarded verbatim as `$filter`". `$filter` is `QueryParams['$filter']`
 * (`../data.ts`) — `Record<string, any> | FilterArray`. So the declaration
 * named a destination it did not type: an author told to forward the value
 * verbatim got a type error on the key the docblock had just told them to
 * forward, and the only way through was `as`, which un-checks the destination's
 * real type at that call site too. The repo's own direction is the opposite one
 * (AGENTS.md #0.1 — fix the declaration, do not widen the consumer).
 *
 * The mirror carried the same gap one layer down, and worse: `z.unknown()`
 * admitted `filter: 'stage=won'` at RUNTIME, and `zod-mirror-parity`'s
 * `Unconstrained< T >` predicate excludes an `unknown` mirror slot from the
 * `WiderThanDeclared` comparison BY DEFINITION, so nothing in the suite would
 * have reported the split once the TS face narrowed. Both faces move together
 * here for that reason.
 *
 * ## The comparative claim the card was argued from, and why it is not repeated
 *
 * objectui#9309 called this "the one view schema of six that is not `any[]`".
 * Measured on the tree this test runs against, that framing does not survive:
 * the file declares NINE optional `filter` members in FOUR spellings, and one
 * of the six `any[]` owners is `NamedListView` — the named-view interface, not
 * a view schema at all. ⛔ So the number is not restated in prose anywhere. The
 * census below re-derives owner and spelling from the AST on every run, which
 * is the only form of that claim that cannot rot (AGENTS.md #9). Two docblocks
 * in `../objectql.ts` and `../zod/objectql.zod.ts` that used to state the count
 * now point here.
 *
 * ## Instruments
 *
 * Ownership is resolved by the TypeScript PARSER — every `filter` property
 * signature is charged to the nearest enclosing `interface` declaration in the
 * AST. ⛔ Never by proximity to the nearest preceding `export interface` LINE:
 * that rule is wrong, and `it('charges a member to its AST owner…')` below is
 * the firing control that shows it is wrong on a fixture where the two answers
 * differ. Line numbers are deliberately NOT pinned — two landings moved this
 * file by +241 lines on the day the card was taken, and a line pin would only
 * record the day it was written.
