 * objectui#3965 — the catalog-scoped gate on DEPRECATED component types,
 * CLOSED at zero.
 *
 * Every catalog entry is an exemplar: the corpus is what a human copies from,
 * and what few-shot retrieval over these examples hands a generating model. A
 * fixture authoring a type the engine itself deprecates therefore teaches the
 * deprecated spelling, and does so at corpus scale. This file makes that
 * measurable, because nothing else in the repo does.
 *
 * ## Nothing stopped the 49th before this file
 *
 * Both gates that touch component types ask only whether the type RESOLVES,
 * never whether it is deprecated:
 *
 *   - `catalog-gallery-render.test.tsx` (objectui#4616) asserts
 *     `ComponentRegistry.get(type)` is truthy and that no OBJUI-001 panel
 *     paints. `div` is registered and renders, so the suite was green with all
 *     85 deprecated nodes present — measured, not assumed.
 *   - `scripts/check-doc-component-types.mjs` asks the same existence question
 *     and walks `content/docs` and nothing else (`DOCS_ROOT = 'content/docs'`),
 *     so `examples/**` is outside its scan surface entirely.
 *
 * The deprecation itself is declared machine-readably since objectui#6674
 * (`deprecated: { surfaces: ['json'], replacement: … }` on the registration,
 * read back through `ComponentRegistry.deprecationFor(type, surface)`), which
 * is what the premise arm and the omission arm below consult.
 *
 * ⚠️ `DEPRECATED_TYPES` stays HAND-KEPT on purpose, and deriving it wholesale
 * from the registry would be a regression rather than the obvious next step.
 * This file loads `@object-ui/components` and nothing else; a type declared
 * deprecated by a plugin package it does not import would silently drop out of
 * a derived list, and the census would shrink to green. The list is the
 * gate's authority precisely because it is complete by construction. What
 * the declaration buys is that the list can now be CHECKED — in both directions
 * — against something a machine can read.
 *
 * ## From ratchet to closed gate (the objectui#3965 arc)
 *
 * When this file landed (PR #6732) it FROZE a stock of 25 files / 80 authored
 * `div` nodes, because the conversion was not mechanical: `div` is
 * class-transparent while every replacement the deprecation notice names
 * injects layout, and `div` reads `children || body` while `container` /
 * `flex` / `stack` / `grid` read `children` only — four sidebar fixtures
 * authored `body`, and a blind swap would have dropped their content silently
 * AT AN UNCHANGED ELEMENT COUNT (measured on the real `basic-sidebar.json`:
 * 21 elements before and after, "Main content area" gone). That measurement
 * is why two sweep rulings were superseded.
 *
 * The 2026-08-29 ruling (方案 A) minted what the vocabulary was missing — the
 * neutral, class-transparent `box` (renders `children`, authored `className`
 * verbatim, zero injected classes; contract pinned in
 * `packages/components/src/renderers/__tests__/box-neutral-container.test.tsx`)
 * — and the stock then drained in one mechanical pass: 25 files / 80 nodes
 * retyped `div`→`box`, the four `body`-authoring nodes moving their content
 * into `children`, each fixture verified through the real `SchemaRenderer`
 * with the ruled dual assertion (element count + text content). So the
 * BASELINE table this file used to carry is gone: the catalog now tolerates
 * ZERO JSON-authored `div` outside the documentation exemption, exactly like
 * `span` all along.
 *
 * ## Why `components-basic-div/` is exempt rather than refused
 *
 * That category DOCUMENTS the deprecated type: it ships `use-card-instead`,
 * `flex-layout` and `grid-layout` beside `nested-divs` and `custom-card`. A
 * category documenting the deprecated type must author the deprecated type —
 * sweeping it would delete the before-and-after that teaches the migration.
 * Same class as the two deliberate legacy examples in `div.mdx`, exempted on
 * 2026-08-09 in any option. The exemption is a DIRECTORY, and it is checked
 * for non-vacuity below so it cannot quietly become a hole nothing uses.
