 * A CROSS-column drop loses the landing POSITION too — objectui#8826, question 3.
 *
 * ── What this file is ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A CHARACTERIZATION pin, not a gate. objectui#8826 measured that a SAME-column
 * reorder is persisted nowhere; its third question — is the landing position
 * within the TARGET column also lost on a CROSS-column move? — was filed
 * explicitly unmeasured, because the fix surface depends on the answer. This
 * file is that measurement, frozen. It asserts today's behaviour so that a
 * later change to it is announced rather than silent; it does NOT claim the
 * behaviour is correct, and it rules nothing about questions 1 and 2 (whether
 * in-column order should be persisted at all, and whether the optimistic update
 * should be removed if not). Those are the maintainer's.
 *
 * ── The answer, and where the index dies ──────────────────────────────────
 * `KanbanImpl.handleDragEnd`'s cross-column branch DOES compute a landing index
 * (`overIndex`) and DOES splice the card in at it, then hands that index to
 * `onCardMove` as its fourth argument. `ObjectKanban.handleCardMove` receives it
 * as `_newIndex` and discards it outright (`void _newIndex`), and
 * `persistCardMove` writes a body of exactly `{ [groupBy]: toColumnId }`. So the
 * index reaches a parameter and stops there: no sink, no PATCH key, no storage.
 * Column MEMBERSHIP flows back through the `columns` prop; ORDER never does —
 * the board's order is whatever `bucketCardsIntoColumns` produces, which is the
 * order of the underlying record array.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ The two data ownerships answer DIFFERENTLY, and that is the finding ──
 * The card anticipated one answer; there are two, because the optimistic write
 * that re-renders the board is itself gated on ownership.
 *
 *  - INTERNAL data (the board fetches): `persistCardMove`'s optimistic
 *    `setFetchedData` re-renders `ObjectKanban`, `KanbanRenderer` re-buckets,
 *    the `columns` identity changes and `KanbanImpl`'s mirror re-syncs from it.
 *    The dropped card therefore leaves the slot the user dropped it in
 *    IMMEDIATELY — inside the same `act()` — and lands wherever record order
 *    puts it. This is WORSE than the same-column signature the card describes:
 *    not a silent revert on some later reflow, but a visible snap on the spot.
 *  - EXTERNAL data (a parent owns `data`, e.g. ListView): the optimistic write
 *    is deliberately skipped, so nothing re-renders and the mirror is never
 *    reset. The drop position SURVIVES on screen — until the parent's next data
 *    reflow, which carries membership and not order. That is the card's
 *    silent-revert signature exactly.
 *
 * ⇒ The position is lost on BOTH paths. They differ only in WHEN the user sees
 *   it happen.
 *
 * ── The instrument ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The card's recorder: the `columns` prop the board receives, captured on every
 * render, via a module mock of `../KanbanImpl` that records and then renders the
 * real board. (`columnsReachDomSameCommit-8534.test.tsx` has a recorder too, but
 * it snapshots the DOM per commit at the `KanbanImpl` seam — a different
 * instrument, and it never drives a cross-column drop.) The board is driven
 * through `DndContext`'s real `onDragEnd`, captured by the second module mock:
 * dnd-kit's pointer sensors need layout and pointer capture that happy-dom does
 * not provide, so a synthesized drop on the production handler is the closest
 * honest reproduction. Everything downstream of that call is the real path.
 *
 * Both controls the measurement needs are here as their own tests:
 *  - LIT positive control — a cross-column move DOES produce a new `columns`
 *    snapshot, with the membership change in it. The instrument is connected,
 *    so "the drop order never appears" is a reading and not a dead wire.
 *  - DEAD negative control — a drag that ends on nothing produces NO new
 *    snapshot and no write. The instrument does not fire spuriously.
 *
 * ── The fixture is built so the two orders cannot coincide ────────────────
 * The moved card is LAST in the record array and is dropped FIRST in the target
 * column. A fixture where the dropped card also happens to sort first would
 * read green whether the index survived or not.
