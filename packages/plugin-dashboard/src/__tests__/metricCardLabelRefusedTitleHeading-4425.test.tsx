/**
 * objectui#4425 — a `metric-card` with `label` is refused with the remedy, and
 * the same card with `title` draws its heading.
 *
 * `MetricCard` spells its heading `title`; `label` is how the sibling `metric`
 * node spells it, and the card inherited `label` from `BaseSchema` without
 * reading it. So a card authored with `label` validated and drew no heading.
 * Under the objectui#8284 ruling (one spelling per rendered thing) the card's
 * declaration refuses `label` by name and names `title`
 * (`@object-ui/types`, the widget slot's component arm). The faces' own pins
 * are in that package's `dashboard-widget-slot-component-arm-7952.test.ts`;
 * this file holds the two halves where the card renders:
 *
 *   1. the refusal, as an author reaches it: both schema faces refuse the card
 *      with `label`, naming `title`, and accept the same card with `title`;
 *   2. the heading: on both dashboard surfaces and on the bare registration,
 *      the card with `title` draws it, and the card with `label`, as stored
 *      metadata no validator ran on, draws none. The second case is why the
 *      refusal is the remedy, not a rendered alias.
