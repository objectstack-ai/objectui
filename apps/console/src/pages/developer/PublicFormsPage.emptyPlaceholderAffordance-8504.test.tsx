/**
 * The Public Forms table's Object column draws the shared `EmptyValue`
 * (objectui#8504).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * A form declaring no `object` fell to `<span
 * className="text-muted-foreground">—</span>` — no `data-slot`, no
 * `aria-label`, none of the shared component's `select-none` / `no-underline` /
 * `pointer-events-none`. In a column headed "Object", a screen-reader user
 * heard a naked punctuation mark while the row above announced "showcase_task".
 *
 * ## Reachability was CHECKED before the swap, not assumed
 *
 * This is the one carrier on the card that lives in `apps/`, not `packages/` —
 * an app's dependency tier, not a library's, and outside the packages-only
 * `git grep` pathspec every census in the thread used (a glob rooted at
 * `packages`, which never sees `apps`). Measured: `@object-ui/components`
 * is on `apps/console`'s `devDependencies` (`workspace:*`) and 29 files under
 * `apps/console/src` already import from it — this page among them. `EmptyValue`
 * joins an import list that was already there; no manifest edge was added, and
 * none was needed.
 *
 * ## Which case DISCRIMINATES — MEASURED, not predicted
 *
 * The caricature was RUN: the Object cell rewritten to `<EmptyValue />`
 * unconditionally, objects included. Every case goes red, on a different
 * assertion:
 *
 *   - `exactly ONE of the two rows draws a placeholder` fails on "and the
 *     filled row does NOT" — the assertion that fails BECAUSE a filled cell
 *     gained a placeholder.
 *   - `NON-REGRESSION` fails one assertion earlier, on "the object reaches the
 *     cell": the caricature also stops the column printing objects, so its own
 *     `no placeholder` half is never reached.
 *   - `THE DEFECT` fails ONLY on its control. Its headline claim — "the
 *     objectless row has an accessible name" — is equally true of a table that
 *     has stopped printing objects.
 *
 * Reverting the fix turns `THE DEFECT` and the one-of-two case red on their
 * headline assertions and leaves `NON-REGRESSION` green.
 *
 * ## The visual delta
 *
 * `text-muted-foreground` (full opacity) becomes the shared
 * `text-muted-foreground/50` — one deliberate step more muted, plus the three
 * affordances and the accessible name. The glyph is unchanged.
 *
 * Assertions are scoped to ONE cell of ONE row (objectui#8495).
