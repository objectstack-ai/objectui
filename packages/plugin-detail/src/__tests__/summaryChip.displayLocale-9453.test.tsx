/**
 * The summary chip's CURRENCY and DATE branches read the declared session
 * locale, not the machine's (objectui#9453).
 *
 * ## The contract, and the one sentence it is being held to
 *
 * `useDisplayLocale` states the rule in its own doc comment: the one thing a
 * caller must not do is reach past the hook and hand `Intl` the `undefined` it
 * gets on an unconfigured workspace, because `undefined` means "the MACHINE's
 * locale, which is neither channel". The chip's percent branch was already on
 * the hook (objectui#9167, and `formatPercent(num, scale, displayLocale)` in
 * the same switch is the working model); its currency, number-fallback,
 * date and datetime branches each passed the literal `undefined`.
 *
 * ## Why every assertion names its locale, and why the table is not the pin
 *
 * An expectation computed from the machine's own locale measures the machine
 * and not the code: on a `de-DE` runner a broken chip and a fixed one print the
 * same bytes. Both legs here therefore DECLARE the session locale — the mount
 * through `LocalizationProvider`, the expectation as a literal string.
 *
 * The literals alone are still a machine-dependent pin: they are red before
 * this card only because this runner happens to resolve to `en-US`. So the
 * assertion that actually carries the card is `a reading of the session
 * locale, not of the machine` below — for each family it renders the SAME
 * stored value under two locales and requires the two readings to differ.
 * Before this card both readings came from the machine, whatever it was, so
 * they were byte-identical and that assertion is red on EVERY runner,
 * including a German one.
 *
 * ## ⛔ What this card does NOT decide — the `en` rows are the control
 *
 * The card carries an open question and leaves it open: whether a KPI chip
 * beside an H1 should keep its deliberately compact face (`maximumFractionDigits: 0`,
 * `dateStyle: 'medium'`) or read exactly like its list cell. Only the locale
 * moves here; every other option in those four bags stays byte-identical.
 *
 * `EN_CONTROL_ROWS` is how that is enforced rather than promised: those rows
 * pass on the pre-card tree AND after it, so a repair that also rounded
 * differently, or swapped the date style, is red here even though it would
 * satisfy every `de-DE` row. They are NOT findings — the chip differing from
 * its list cell in `en` is this chip's declared choice, and this card is not
 * about it.
