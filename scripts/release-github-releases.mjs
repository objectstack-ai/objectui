/**
 * release-github-releases.mjs — create (or update) one GitHub Release per
 * published package, with a body that CANNOT exceed the Releases API's
 * 125,000-character limit.
 *
 * ## Why this exists in this repository (objectui#11596)
 *
 * `.github/workflows/changeset-release.yml` publishes through
 * `changesets/action@v1`, and v1 learns WHAT was published by parsing the
 * publish script's stdout for `New tag: <pkg>@<version>` lines. Only for the
 * packages it finds there does it push the git tag (`git.pushTag`) and create
 * the GitHub Release (`runPublish` in the action's `src/run.ts`, v1.9.0).
 *
 * objectui#5296 moved this repository to `@changesets/cli` v3, whose
 * `changeset publish` reports through `@clack/prompts` and an output report
 * instead, and prints no `New tag` line at all. v1 therefore saw zero
 * published packages, pushed no tag and created no Release — and failed
 * nothing, because the publish lane's npm check reads npm only. 17.6.0 and
 * 17.7.0 reached npm with neither.
 *
 * `changeset publish` still CREATES the tags on the runner; the workflow's
 * "Push the release tags" step pushes them (using `--print-tags` below for the
 * set it owes), and its "Create GitHub Releases" step runs this script. Neither
 * depends on the action's stdout parse any more.
 *
 * ## Why the body limit matters here too (objectstack#4900)
 *
 * The action posted each package's raw CHANGELOG section as the Release body,
 * and the Releases API rejects a body over 125,000 characters:
 *
 *     HttpError: Validation Failed:
 *       {"resource":"Release","code":"custom","field":"body",
 *        "message":"body is too long (maximum is 125000 characters)"}
 *
 * objectstack hit that first, which is why it wrote this script. This
 * repository hit it too, unnoticed: measured when this port was written,
 * `@object-ui/app-shell`'s 17.5.0 section was 158,203 characters, and
 * `@object-ui/app-shell@17.5.0` has a tag but no Release while its 38
 * siblings have both. The 17.7.0 sections are larger still —
 * `packages/types/CHANGELOG.md`'s is past a million characters. ⛔ Those are
 * one day's readings, not live figures: the self-test below re-measures the
 * types section on every run and prints it.
 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * Faithful to what `changesets/action` produced, minus the failure: same tag
 * (`<pkg>@<version>`), same release name, same `prerelease` rule, and the same
 * changelog-entry body — extracted with a direct port of the action's own
 * `getChangelogEntry`, so an under-limit body is byte-identical to what the
 * action would have posted.
 *
 * Beyond that it adds the properties the action's version lacked:
 *
 *   - **Bounded.** A body over the limit is truncated at a line boundary, with
 *     an unbalanced code fence closed so the notice renders as markdown, and a
 *     link to the full entry in CHANGELOG.md at this exact commit.
 *   - **Idempotent.** Looks the release up by tag first: PATCH when it exists,
 *     POST when it does not. A re-run is a no-op-shaped update, never an
 *     `already_exists` 422 — which matters because a partial failure is the
 *     normal state to recover from, and because the backfill of 17.6.0 and
 *     17.7.0 runs this same script by hand.
 *   - **Safe under a concurrent writer.** The read and the POST are two
 *     requests, and nothing excludes a second writer of one version's
 *     Releases: a re-run of the workflow, a hand-run backfill, or the
 *     action's own Release creation should its stdout parse ever find a
 *     package again (it is dormant under CLI v3, not removed). objectstack
 *     measured the race on its 17.6.0: nine POSTs answered
 *     `422 {"code":"already_exists","field":"tag_name"}` because the other
 *     writer created the release between the read and the POST. That 422 now
 *     means what it says — the release exists — so the script re-reads it by
 *     tag and PATCHes it, and two writers converge on one release per tag. Any
 *     OTHER 422 (the body limit above) still fails the release exactly as
 *     before.
 *   - **Duplicates are reported, never deleted.** The same race proved the API
 *     will ACCEPT two creates for one tag inside one second. No request
 *     sequence on this side can prevent that, so after its writes the script
 *     reads the Releases list and names every tag it released that has more
 *     than one. A duplicate this run CREATED one of fails the run
 *     (`::error::`) — the race was this run's, and without the failure the
 *     convergence above would turn a red race into a green run with a
 *     duplicate in it. A duplicate that predates this run's writes is a
 *     `::warning::`: it was the creating run's to fail. Either way the report
 *     names each Release id, its assets and the id the by-tag endpoint
 *     resolves to. Deleting a Release is a release act and the maintainer's
 *     call — this script never sends a DELETE.
 *   - **Per-package isolation.** The action ran the whole set through one
 *     `Promise.all`, so the first rejection abandoned the rest. This runs them
 *     sequentially, collects failures, and still exits non-zero — one
 *     package's oversized changelog can no longer cost its siblings their
 *     releases.
 *
 * Sequential is also deliberate for the writes: objectstack#2191 is the
 * standing lesson that bursts of concurrent ref-creating requests race
 * GitHub's backend.
 *
 * ⚠️ A POST for a tag that is NOT on the remote makes the API create it — a
 * lightweight tag at `target_commitish` (this run's `GITHUB_SHA`). That is why
 * the workflow pushes the annotated tags `changeset publish` created BEFORE
 * this script runs, and why a run that could not push them still gets its
 * Releases on the commit it published from, rather than none.
 *
 * Run:
 *   node scripts/release-github-releases.mjs              # from changeset-release.yml
 *   node scripts/release-github-releases.mjs --self-test  # verify the logic
 *   node scripts/release-github-releases.mjs --dry-run    # plan + sizes only, no API call
 *   node scripts/release-github-releases.mjs --print-tags # the `<pkg>@<version>` tags owed, one per line
 *
 * Env:
 *   RELEASE_VERSION   the version the publish lane shipped. Every publishable
 *                     workspace package is released at this version (the
 *                     Changesets `fixed` group bumps in lockstep). This is the
 *                     input changeset-release.yml passes.
 *   PUBLISHED         a changesets/action `publishedPackages` JSON; takes
 *                     precedence when non-empty. Kept from the port, and NOT
 *                     passed by this repository's workflow: under CLI v3 the
 *                     action's parse reports `[]`, which is this card's defect.
 *   GITHUB_TOKEN      repo-scoped token with `contents: write`.
 *   GITHUB_REPOSITORY / GITHUB_SHA / GITHUB_API_URL / GITHUB_SERVER_URL
 *                     standard Actions context. A hand-run backfill sets
 *                     GITHUB_SHA to the commit the version was PUBLISHED from.
