 * pins this exact list against `ObjectMapConfigSchema.shape` — imported only

 *
 * ── Why these keys, and not new ones ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `detail.recordDetailWithLabel` is borrowed from the `detail.*` namespace
 * rather than minted as `view.recordDetail`: `NavigationOverlay` — the very
 * component that heading is handed to — already resolves that namespace, as do
 * `ListView` / `ObjectGrid` / `ObjectKanban` / `ObjectTree`, and one heading on
 * one control should not get several translations that can drift apart.
 *
 * `form.createTitle` / `form.editTitle` are reused for the same reason, and are
 * not new: all ten packs already carry them, and `app-shell` already heads the
 * PAGE-mode record form with exactly these (`RecordFormPage.tsx`,
 * `AppContent.tsx`). The drawer / modal / popover titles below are the same
 * heading on a different surface, so they resolve the same keys — minting a
 * parallel `console.objectView.*` family would have guaranteed the two spellings
 * drift (zh already distinguishes 新建 from 创建). Only the third verb,
 * `form.viewTitle`, had no sibling; it was added to all ten packs.
 *
 * Note the placeholder is `{{object}}`, not `{{label}}` — that is the variable
 * the existing `form.*Title` family declares, and the pack-vs-en placeholder
 * parity guard compares placeholder sets per key.
 *
 * `detail.recordDetailWithLabel` doubles as the probe key: under a provider
 * `t()` returns the pack's template (≠ the key) so the real translator is used;
 * with no provider the key comes back unchanged and this map supplies the
 * English.

   * `if (!dataSource?.onMutation …) return;` and
   * `if (!dataSource || !schema.objectName) return;`.
   *
   * The promise was not invented, it was MISFILED. `ObjectViewRenderer`
   * (`./index.tsx`) — the renderer registered for the `object-view` and `view`
   * schema tags — is the thing that does exactly what that sentence described:
   * it reads `useContext(SchemaRendererContext)` and hands `ctx?.dataSource`
   * down to this prop. A schema-driven host therefore does get the provider's
   * adapter; a caller writing `<ObjectView …>` in TSX does not, and tsc
   * refuses the omission at the call site.
   *
   * What happens if it is absent anyway (an untyped JS host, or that
   * registered renderer with no provider mounted, which passes `null`):
   * nothing throws and nothing is fetched. `useSettledSchema` settles with
   * `def: null`, both effects return early, and the value is forwarded
   * verbatim to `ObjectGrid` / `SchemaRenderer`, whose own `dataSource` is
   * declared optional. The view renders its chrome and stays empty.
   *

/**
 * HOST-COMPOSITION SURFACE on the `object-view` node — the keys the
 * `renderListView` delegation branch reads off the node that are deliberately
 * NOT declared members of `ObjectViewSchema`, and ⛔ not to be taught as
 * schema keys anywhere in the docs (objectui#5097).
 *
 * ## The verdict
 *
 * The delegation branch in `renderContent` below reads 31 distinct keys off
 * the object-view node through `(schema as any).K` and forwards them to the
 * host's list renderer. Four of them — `data`, `navigation`,
 * `searchableFields`, `filterableFields`, listed in
 * {@link OBJECT_VIEW_DECLARED_FORWARDED_KEYS} — are declared members of
 * `ObjectViewSchema`. The other 27, listed here, are not, and stay that way:
 * they are HOST-COMPOSITION surface, not authored surface. This constant is
 * their single home; the branch is fenced by `#region` markers so the pin in
 * `src/__tests__/objectViewHostSurface.test.tsx` fails BY NAME when a read is
 * added or removed without touching this list.
 *
 * ## The ruling that made it deliberate
 *
 * Maintainer, 2026-08-18, on objectui#5097, verbatim 「同意」: the 27 keys are
 * HOST surface, exempted with reasons — not authored surface. Basis: measured
 * reachability. The delegation branch is entered ONLY when a host passes the
 * `renderListView` prop; the registered renderer does not pass it; so the
 * schema-registration path documented to authors cannot reach these keys at
 * all, and declaring them on `ObjectViewSchema` would promise authors a
 * surface that does nothing on their path.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not declare these on `ObjectViewSchema`, and ⛔ do not delete a read as
 * a tidy-up — deleting a read is what silently blanks a stored app-shell
 * document, and it is exactly what a reader of "not authored surface" is most
 * likely to think is the clean finish. The structural follow-through (typing
 * this block as an explicit host-side prop contract, so host surface and
 * authored surface are separated in types, and retiring the `(schema as any)`
 * reads) is owned by the objectui#5043 family track, not by this exemption.
 *
 * ## Who supplies the prop — what makes "host surface" checkable
 *
 * Every in-tree non-test supplier lives in `@object-ui/app-shell`, and there
 * are TWO of them. Re-measured on `main` at `e03dfa5ea`; both were already
 * present at the ruling's base `9fbb9b52f`, which named only the first:
 *
 *   - `packages/app-shell/src/views/ObjectView.tsx:1718` — the React host
 *     defines the callback; it is passed at `:2481` and `:2524`.
 *   - `packages/app-shell/src/views/studio-design/StudioDesignSurface.tsx:2575`
 *     — the Studio design surface, as `renderListView={renderStudioGridList}`.
 *
 * The registered renderer is `ObjectViewRenderer` (`./index.tsx:58`), which
 * renders `ObjectView` with `schema` and `dataSource` only and passes no
 * `renderListView`. It is registered twice — under `object-view`
 * (`./index.tsx:66`) and under the alias `view` (`./index.tsx:100`) — and
 * neither registration can reach this branch.
 *
 * ## What the contract says about these keys
 *
 * Nothing at all, and that is the shape of the answer here — unlike the
 * sibling `object-grid` exemption (objectui#5091, PR #5241), where the spec
 * answered `unrecognized_keys` by name. `@objectstack/spec`'s
 * `ComponentPropsMap` carries no `object-view` entry, so the repo-wide
 * `registry-inputs-spec-parity` gate — which derives its expectations FROM
 * `ComponentPropsMap` — never covers this node in either direction and is owed
 * nothing here. The node's published authoring surface is the registry
 * `inputs` list at `./index.tsx:71-86` (15 names; the alias `view` declares no
 * `inputs` at all), and none of the 27 appears on either registration.
 *
 * ## The one asymmetry — `conditionalFormatting` — RESOLVED (objectui#5248)
 *
 * As ruled on 2026-08-18, 26 of the 27 were read ONLY inside the host-only
 * branch, and `conditionalFormatting` had a SECOND read site in
 * `generateViewSchema`'s kanban branch — reachable through the REGISTERED
 * renderer, so for that one key the ruling's "the authored path cannot reach
 * it" basis was narrower than for its 26 neighbours. objectui#5097 recorded the
 * gap rather than acting on it and filed the contract question as
 * objectui#5248.
 *
 * That question is now answered, and the gap is closed. Maintainer ruling of
 * 2026-08-19 (verbatim 「全部接受」, recorded on objectui#5248): a conditional —
 * Option 2 gated on a liveness check, Option 1 (declare the key) had the check
 * found real authored usage. The liveness check came back EMPTY:
 *
 *   - objectui `content/docs/**`, `skills/**`, `examples/**`, `apps/**`:
 *     `conditionalFormatting` occurs in exactly two files, on `object-grid`
 *     (`content/docs/plugins/plugin-grid.mdx`) and on `list-view`
 *     (`skills/objectui/guides/schema-expressions.md`) — both DECLARED homes,
 *     neither an object-view node.
 *   - objectstack: no authored `object-view` node exists at all (two prose
 *     mentions repo-wide), against 54 files carrying `object-form` and 19
 *     carrying `object-grid` as the control.
 *   - No in-repo fixture or catalog schema carries both an object-view node and
 *     the key: the only files carrying both are this one, its pin test, the
 *     type declarations, app-shell's host (which reads the key into the
 *     delegated `list-view` node, not onto the object-view node) and prose.
 *
 * So the fallback read was dropped from the kanban branch (see
 * `kanbanConditionalFormatting`). Every one of the 27 is now read ONLY inside
 * the `#region` fence, and the exemption's stated basis holds for all of them
 * without exception. The pin in `objectViewHostSurface.test.tsx` asserts the
 * resolution directly: ZERO exempt keys are read outside the fence.

 * the `views` PROP on this component, which is typed `ViewType` — and

 * those two branches are unreachable, including the tree branch's own

 * authoring-surface obligation with no measured pull; the exemption gets
 * revisited the day a real metadata-authoring need for tree or chart views
 * arrives.
 *
 * ## Host-only is not dead — the path is live
 *
 * Measured, not assumed: `@object-ui/app-shell`'s console passes stored view
 * records to this component as `views`, and its `CreateViewDialog` offers
 * `tree` and `chart` among the nine types a console user can create. That is
 * the path these branches serve, and it is why the icon map beside them is
 * total over `ViewType` rather than over the authored union.
 *
 * ## What holds the record honest
 *
 * The exemption is a claim about REACHABILITY, so both halves are pinned:
 *
 *   - `src/__tests__/objectViewHostSurface.test.tsx` — the record. The branch
 *     set is re-derived from the `#region` fence around the switch below, so a
 *     ninth branch (or a deleted one) fails BY NAME instead of quietly
 *     changing what this list describes; and type-level pins fail
 *     `pnpm type-check` the day either authored union grows a `tree` or
 *     `chart` member, because that is the day this record goes stale.
 *   - `src/__tests__/ObjectView.hostOnlyViewTypes.test.tsx` — the basis,
 *     measured: a host `views` prop still reaches both branches. An exemption
 *     whose reachability stops being proved is a record about nothing.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not "finish" this by deleting the branches as unreachable code. They
 * are unreachable from AUTHORED metadata only; host composition is a supported
 * path with a live consumer.

   * changes.
   *
   * `activeView` is an ELEMENT of the `views` prop array, so a host that builds
   * that array inline (`views={[{ id: 'cal', type: 'calendar', label: … }]}` —
   * how this component's own docs write it) hands over a fresh object every
   * time it renders. Listing `activeView` itself made the fetch effect re-run
   * once per PARENT render: measured 4 `find` calls where a hoisted array gives
   * 1, and because `ObjectView` passes `data={data}` down, each of those also
   * re-delivered a fresh row array to the child view.
   *
   * ⚠️ The three members are not interchangeable with "whatever the effect
   * touches", and objectui#6460's own body got this wrong — it said the effect
   * reads `filter` and `type`. Measured in the effect body, it reads `filter`
   * and **`sort`** (`type` reaches it only via `currentViewType`, its own
   * dependency). Dropping `sort` would stop a host that changes only a view's
   * sort from ever re-querying — a worse defect than the churn, and invisible
   * to any test written from that sentence.
   *
   * `id` is carried deliberately even though the effect does not read it: it is
   * the host's own answer to "which view is active", it is a string and so
   * cannot churn, and pinning it keeps switching views observably re-fetching
   * even between two views whose filter and sort happen to coincide. Same
   * ingredients as the display key this file already derives further down
   * (`${schema.objectName}-${activeNamedView || activeView?.id || 'default'}-…`).
   *
   * Precedence is NOT flattened here. Both values still lose to
   * `currentNamedViewConfig` at the read sites in the effect, exactly as before;
   * this only decides WHEN the effect re-runs, never which source wins.

  // their canonical successors `pagination` / `selection` / `filter` / `sort`
  // on the floor. An author who wrote the canonical shape the type recommends
  // got a compile-clean, semantically correct, RUNTIME-INERT view.
  //
  // ObjectGrid already reads both spellings of all four and already resolves
  // them canonical-first (`schema.pagination?.pageSize ?? schema.pageSize`;
  // `if (schema.selection?.type) … else if (schema.selectable !== undefined)`;
  // `schemaFilter !== undefined ? … : schema.defaultFilters`;
  // `schemaSort ?? (schema.defaultSort ? [schema.defaultSort] : undefined)`).
  // So the fix is forwarding, not translation — and the precedence is not a
  // free choice here: emitting both slots lets ObjectGrid's existing
  // canonical-wins rule decide, which is the only answer that keeps the two
  // layers saying the same thing.
  //
  // objectui#5270: the two segments AHEAD of `table` had a second, separate
  // problem — an ARITY mismatch, not a spelling one. Both of them carry an
  // ARRAY of sort keys (`NamedListView.sort` is `Array< { field, order } >`;
  // the `views` prop declares an array too) and both were being written into
  // `defaultSort`, which is declared a SINGLE `{ field, order }`. Neither of
  // ObjectGrid's two readers survives that:
  //
  //   header  `parseSchemaSort(schemaSort ?? [schema.defaultSort])` becomes
  //           `parseSchemaSort([[{ field, order }]])`. The outer array is
  //           iterated and each entry must be a string or an object with a
  //           string `field`; a nested ARRAY is neither, so the entry is
  //           dropped and the result is `[]` — no arrow, the view arrives
  //           looking unsorted.
  //   fetch   `` `${(schema.defaultSort as any).field} ${….order}` `` reads two
  //           missing keys off an array and sends the literal string
  //           `"undefined undefined"` as `$orderby`.
  //
  // So the view's sort now rides the CANONICAL slot, `ObjectGridSchema.sort`,
  // which holds the multi-key arity a view carries. That is also the shape the
  // shared sort sink accepts (`convertSortToQueryParams`, `SortConfig[]` —
  // objectui#4869, narrowed to the array alone by objectui#8221), so this
  // converges on the normalized dialect instead of introducing another.
  // Precedence is unchanged: ObjectGrid resolves `sort ?? defaultSort`, so a

  // compile-time witness: `ObjectViewSchema.table` collapses to a bare index
  // signature (objectui#5102) and this node is assembled on the host-
  // composition surface (objectui#5097), whose `renderListView` slot types
  // `schema` as `any`.
  //
  // Every reader of that slot then drops the sort SILENTLY — no crash, no
  // error, just an unsorted list: `ListView.parseSortConfig` and
  // `ObjectGrid.parseSchemaSort` both open `typeof sort === 'string' ? [sort]
  // : Array.isArray(sort) ? sort : []`, so a bare object yields `[]`, and the
