/**
 * objectui#6152 round 12 — the gallery capability gate asked the `options` bag
 * for the LEGACY cover spelling only.
 *
 * `availableViews` resolved gallery from three rungs: `schema.gallery`'s two
 * spellings, and `schema.options.gallery.imageField`. There was no canonical
 * rung for the bag, so a bag binding its cover under the spec's `coverField`
 * rendered a gallery (`ObjectGallery` reads the nested `coverField` first) that
 * the switcher never offered. The same shape as objectui#8193 for kanban.
 *
 * It became reachable in the same round: app-shell's `galleryViewOptions` now
 * writes `coverField` alone (the legacy `imageField` is refused by name in the
 * bag `@object-ui/types` judges). Measured before the rung existed, on
 * objectui#6152 (report 6070437445): a `{ coverField }` bag was not offered, the
 * `{ imageField, coverField }` bag was, and a top-level `gallery.coverField` was.
 *
 * ⛔ NO ALIAS READ WAS REMOVED. Stored metadata written before the view write
 * door judged the bag may still carry `imageField`; the readers' retirement is a
 * later round on objectui#6152.
 *
 * Both directions are pinned: the canonical-bag arms answer YES, and the arms at
 * the bottom answer NO for a bag with no cover binding, so the rung cannot
 * degrade into "offer the gallery whenever it is whitelisted".
