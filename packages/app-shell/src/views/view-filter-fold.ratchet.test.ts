 *
 * Two ratchets on one call site, in order of strength.
 *
 * **objectui#4155 (the current contract): the list toolbar's filter panel must
 * not persist ANYTHING.** Filter-panel state is transient — it belongs to the
 * session and to `writeListFilterState`'s per-browser restore, not to the
 * view's stored body. It used to write a view-customization overlay on every
 * `onFilterChange`, so opening the panel and clicking `Add filter` put an
 * incomplete `field equals ''` condition into `sys_metadata`, where it REPLACED
 * the source-declared `filter` for every user of that view and emptied the
 * list. Overlay writes belong to an EXPLICIT save (`handleViewConfigSave`, and
 * `ObjectDataPage`'s "Save as view").
 *
 * **objectstack#5159 (subsumed, still pinned): the FilterBuilder's
 * `FilterGroup` must never reach a persisted view `filter`.** Its bug was that
 * the toolbar handed `onFilterChange`'s payload straight to
 * `persistViewPatch({ filter })` — the builder's grouped dialect against
 * `ListViewSchema.filter`'s `z.array(ViewFilterRuleSchema)`, so every
 * `Filter → Add filter → save` came back 422 `invalid_union`. #4155 removes the
 * write entirely, which is strictly stronger for THIS call site; the fold
 * survives because the explicit save paths still need it, and this file keeps
 * guarding them.
 *
 * If the #4155 assertions fail: do not re-add a filter persist to any toolbar
 * handler. A user's panel interaction is not a save.
 *
 * If the #5159 assertions fail: route the group through
 * `foldFilterGroupToSpecRules` (`./viewFilterFold`), which folds to
 * `ViewFilterRule[]` and refuses — out loud — the shapes that cannot fold
 * losslessly.
