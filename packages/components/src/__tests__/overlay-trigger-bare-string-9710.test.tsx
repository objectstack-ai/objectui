/**
 * objectui#9710 — the CLASS pin for a Radix `*Trigger` fed an authored
 * `trigger` node slot. objectui#9701 repaired one instance (`collapsible`);
 * this file is what keeps the tenth key from repeating it, and triage asked for
 * exactly that: 「任一 `asChild` trigger 收到裸字符串即红」.
 *
 * ## Why this file enumerates the REGISTRY and never a list of files
 *
 * A pin that names the eight renderers this card repaired is green forever on
 * the ninth — it re-asserts the diff that was already written instead of
 * guarding the class. So the population here is derived at run time: every
 * block in the registry that DECLARES a `trigger` slot in its `inputs`. A key
 * added tomorrow is covered on the day it registers one, in whatever file and
 * whatever spelling, and a key deleted stops being asserted with no edit here.
 * ⛔ No count is written down anywhere in this file (AGENTS.md #9) — the
 * enumeration is the instrument, and the readings are whatever it enumerates.
 *
 * ⭐ This file is now the ONLY live instrument for the class. A repaired call
 * site carries no `asChild` attribute and no `*Trigger` tag of its own, so the
 * source-grep recipe published on the card can no longer tell a repaired
 * renderer from a deleted one.
 *
 * ⚠️ Named limit: the enumeration sees what `../renderers` registered. A block
 * in a `plugin-*` package registering its own `trigger` slot is NOT covered
 * here and would need the same reading in its own package. Measured, not
 * assumed: no such block exists today.
 *
 * ## The two arms, which are NOT the same mismatch
 *
 * They were reported as one in this card's first delivery, and that was wrong
 * in a way that hid a regression, so they are separated here by construction.
 *
 *  - **Non-empty, not a single element** — a bare string, a number, a
 *    multi-node array. `asChild` resolves the primitive to Radix's `Slot`,
 *    which merges onto a single React element and THROWS on anything else it is
 *    given. Both published faces admit these (`SchemaNode` names `string`
 *    explicitly and the zod mirror types each `trigger` key against that same
 *    union), so `trigger: 'Open it'` validated twice and then painted
 *    `SchemaRenderer`'s error boundary. THIS is the defect objectui#9710 filed.
 *  - **Empty** — omitted, `null`, `''`, `0`, `[]`. Read from the
 *    lockfile-pinned `@radix-ui/react-slot`, the throwing branch is guarded by
 *    `if (children || children === 0)`, so a `null` child is returned as-is and
 *    NEVER threw. This arm was never broken — and the first repair broke it,
 *    turning "no trigger at all" into one empty focusable button on every key
 *    whose zod face makes `trigger` optional. `OMITTED_TRIGGER_PAINTS_NOTHING`
 *    below is that arm, pinned so it cannot be broken silently again.
 *
 * ## Controls — a green here is worthless without them
 *
 *  - `ENUMERATION_CONNECTED` — the population is non-empty and contains blocks
 *    this card did NOT touch (`collapsible`, repaired earlier and living in
 *    `renderers/disclosure/`; `context-menu`, which was never defective because
 *    its `asChild` child is a real `div`). A pin covering only this PR's own
 *    eight files would fail this control, which is the failure mode the file
 *    exists to avoid.
 *  - `ZOD_FACES_READ` — the optional/required split used by the omitted-trigger
 *    arm is derived from the published zod faces at run time, and is asserted
 *    to DISCRIMINATE (at least one of each). A derivation that silently
 *    returned nothing would make that arm vacuous, which is the one way this
 *    file could go quietly green while broken.
 *  - `ASCHILD_STILL_ON` — an ELEMENT trigger is still MERGED onto the Radix
 *    trigger rather than wrapped by it. This is what makes the repair targeted
 *    rather than a blanket `asChild` removal: withheld only where Radix
 *    structurally cannot serve.
 *  - `REDDENS_FOR_A_NINTH` — a deliberately defective block is registered
 *    inside the test, and THE assertion above (the errored-out list is empty)
 *    is observed holding exactly that block's name. Without this, "the pin
 *    covers a ninth renderer" would be a claim about an assertion that has
 *    never once been observed failing.
