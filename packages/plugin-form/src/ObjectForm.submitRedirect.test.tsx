 *
 * What `ObjectForm` DOES with a declared `submitBehavior: { kind: 'redirect' }`
 * (objectui#4989), under the shape objectstack#7496 ruled on 2026-08-11 and
 * objectstack#7657 landed in `@objectstack/spec` (17.0.0 GA).
 *
 * The value-level consequences are pinned in `submitRedirect.test.ts` against the
 * spec's own schema. This file pins the things only the rendered component can
 * show, and each of them is one of the card's defects:
 *
 *   - **defect 2** — an out-of-contract destination is REFUSED VISIBLY. The write
 *     already succeeded, so the submitter sees the confirmation (and the form is
 *     gone, so there is nothing left to resubmit) plus the reason nothing was
 *     navigated to. Silence was the outcome the ruling's consumer half rules out,
 *     and it had a real cost: a still-filled form invites a second submit, which
 *     writes a second record.
 *   - **defect 3** — a SAME-ORIGIN ABSOLUTE url is refused. The old guard
 *     (`isSameOriginUrl`, since deleted by objectui#5034) said yes to it, so
 *     this consumer accepted a spelling the authoring door refuses.
 *   - **defect 5** — `{{record.field_name}}` is substituted from the record the
 *     submit just wrote, URL-escaped.
 *
 * **Defect 4 (mount-blindness) is fixed separately**, by the optional injected
 * navigation seam the maintainer ruled on 2026-08-17;
 * `submitRedirect.injectedNavigation.test.tsx` carries it. These tests mount no
 * host provider, which is a supported state and the one that keeps
 * `window.location.assign` — so they still assert the string it is called with,
 * and that assertion is now also the pin on the absent-seam fallback staying
 * byte-for-byte what it was.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification — predicted first, then measured (counts are measured)
 *
 * 1. **Restoring the old same-origin guard around the old assign**
 *    (`isSameOriginUrl(behavior.url)`; the helper was deleted by objectui#5034,
 *    so the mutation is now spelled inline) — i.e.
 *    putting the whole pre-ruling consumption back: **6 of the 9 tests here go
 *    RED, 3 stay green** (12 red across both component files; WizardForm's is
 *    6 of 7). The three survivors are `navigates to a ruled relative path` and
 *    the two `delayMs` cases — all three describe behaviour the old line ALSO
 *    had, which is the honest reading: this change did not alter what happens to
 *    an in-contract destination.
 *
 *    The two refusal tests go red in two DIFFERENT ways, which is why they are
 *    kept separate. The same-origin absolute case fails on the assign — the old
 *    guard answers yes, so it navigates where the contract refuses (defect 3).
 *    The protocol-relative case fails on the refusal being ABSENT — the old guard
 *    answers no and then nothing happens at all, which is defect 2's silence in
 *    its purest form.
 *
 *    Measured and worth stating: `submitRedirect.test.ts` stays **entirely
 *    green** under this mutation. It kills the CALL SITE, leaving the module
 *    correct and unused — precisely why the mechanism is pinned here and not
 *    only there.
 * 2. **Deleting only the `toast.error` + `setSubmitted` refusal arm**, keeping the
 *    schema parse so the destination is simply dropped: **exactly the 3 tests in
 *    the refusal block go RED** (6 across both files) and all 10 in-contract
 *    tests stay green — a narrow, non-overlapping change detector for defect 2 on
 *    its own. Note what this mutation IS: the original bug, reproduced with the
 *    stricter guard in place. "The guard is relative-only now" is therefore not
 *    by itself the fix.
 * 3. **Replacing the spec's refusal with a local hand-written sentence**: **18 red
 *    overall** — 14 in `submitRedirect.test.ts` (every one of the 13 refusal
 *    families, plus the external-alternative case) and the 2 refusal tests in
 *    each component file, on their `RELATIVE path only` / ruling-citation /
 *    `protocol-relative` assertions. That is the load-bearing probe: the sentence
 *    on screen is provably the live schema parse's, not a local string.
 * 4. **Deleting the `encodeURIComponent`**: **10 red** — `escapes an interpolated
 *    value into one segment` here and in the wizard file, plus 8 in the unit
 *    file's escape and hostile-value blocks.

/**
 * A refusal CITES THE RULING it comes from, in either spelling the spec uses.
 *
 * This is the assertion that proves the sentence on screen is the live schema
 * parse's and not a local hand-written string (mutation probe 3 below). It was
 * spelled `toContain('#7496')` and pinned the citation FORM: `@objectstack/spec`
 * 17.3.0 restated the same provenance as `(ruled 2026-08-11)`, so the token
 * vanished while the refusal, its reasoning and its prescription all stayed.
 * ⛔ Not re-pinned to the new prose verbatim — that moves the brittleness
 * instead of removing it.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why there is no bare `#\d{3,}` alternative any more
 *
 * The first spelling of this regex was
 * `/\(ruled \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\)|#\d{3,}/` — two alternatives, to admit
 * either form upstream uses. The loose half discriminated NOTHING
 * (objectui#7122 contract review): this repo's own hand-written messages
 * routinely cite `objectui#NNNN`, so a locally authored sentence satisfied it,
 * and telling those two apart is this assertion's entire job. Only the
 * `(ruled …)` half was ever load-bearing.
 *
 * It was also unnecessary, which is the measurement that settled it. Both
 * spellings, read off the installed artifacts rather than recalled:
 *
 *   17.2.0  "… and this is an absolute URL (ruled 2026-08-11 on #7496)."
 *   17.3.0  "… and this is an absolute URL (ruled 2026-08-11)."
 *
 * The issue number never appears OUTSIDE that parenthesis, so `(ruled ` + a
 * date already matched both releases on its own. The optional ` on #NNNN` tail
 * keeps the 17.2.0 spelling admissible — the two-form latitude the alternative
 * was added for — without admitting a bare local `#7122`.
