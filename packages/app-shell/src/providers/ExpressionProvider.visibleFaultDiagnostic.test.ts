/**
 * objectui#6443 — a nav / area / field `visible` predicate that FAULTS is
 * reported, through the same reporter and the same rate limit as the node gate
 * (objectui#6038) and the `page:tabs` item gate.
 *
 * ## The defect, and why a runtime suite could not see it
 *
 * `evaluateCondition` is FAIL-SOFT: it answers an unevaluable predicate with
 * `true` from its own `catch` and does not throw. So `evaluateVisibility`'s
 * `try/catch` never saw a predicate fault at all — the whole class was
 * swallowed one layer down, in silence, in BOTH builds. Measured on this base
 * before the fix, the neighbouring suite
 * (`ExpressionProvider.evaluateVisibility.test.ts`) passes green against the
 * defect and always did: its `fails open (visible) on an unevaluable predicate`
 * case asserts the exact verdict the broken site returns. That is the argument
 * for this file's existence — the observable difference is on the console, and
 * nothing was looking there.
 *
 * The consequence is a permission boundary that stops biting: a menu entry
 * whose `visible` was written to exclude a role renders for that role, looking
 * exactly like an entry the author meant to show.
 *
 * ## What is pinned, split into cells that DISAGREE and cells that must not
 *
 * DISCRIMINATING (red against `origin/main`, green after) — every dialect from
 * the card's measured table, the message content that carries this site's
 * dedupe-key decision, both halves of the rate limit, and the defensive throw
 * path.
 *
 * CONTROLS (green BOTH ways, deliberately, each named at its case):
 *   - the positive/degenerate console-capture pair, without which every
 *     `toHaveLength(0)` here is equally green on a spy that observes nothing;
 *   - FAIL-OPEN IS UNCHANGED. This card is diagnostics only. A faulting
 *     predicate must still leave the item visible — including for the role it
 *     was written to exclude. The cell guards the future wrong shape where a
 *     diagnostic change quietly also flips fail-open to fail-closed, which
 *     would be a permission-boundary change wearing an observability costume.
 *   - a HEALTHY predicate stays silent on BOTH verdicts, which guards the
 *     future wrong shape where the reporter fires on a genuine `false`.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification — direction predicted BEFORE the run
 *
 * Restoring `ExpressionProvider.tsx` from `origin/main` (i.e. deleting the
 * `onFault` option and the `report` call in the `catch`) turns RED exactly the
 * discriminating cells above — `reports()` goes to 0 in each — and leaves the
 * four control cells GREEN. The `${…}` cell moves in a second, independent
 * direction: its TOTAL console line count goes 1 -> 3, because that dialect's
 * built-in warning fires once per evaluation and is not deduped (the separate
 * defect objectui#6444 tracks, which this card does not fix and does not need
 * to: supplying `onFault` transfers reporting away from it at this site).
 *
 * ## Predicate sources are unique per case, on purpose
 *
 * The `unit` project runs with `isolate: false`, and the built-in CEL warning
 * in `@object-ui/core`'s `evalFieldPredicate` dedupes in module state this file
 * cannot reset. A source string shared with any other test file would let that
 * dedupe decide this file's line counts.
