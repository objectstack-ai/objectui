/**
 * `ObjectGrid`'s record-detail overlay heading resolves an INLINE locale map
 * label instead of stringifying it — objectui#9092.
 *
 * ── Why this site needed its own pin ──────────────────────────────────────
 * objectui#9092 restored `ObjectGridSchema.label` to `string | I18nLabel`, the
 * form `BaseSchema` has carried since objectui#4580. The other two reads in
 * `ObjectGrid.tsx` that put the label in a string position were found because
 * `tsc` NAMED them: the data-table `caption` and the export `viewLabel` are
 * both `string`-typed sinks, so the widening surfaced them as compile errors.
 *
 * This one is different, and that is the transferable part: `detailTitle` hands
 * the label to `createSafeTranslation`'s `t(key, options)`, whose options
 * parameter is `Record<string, unknown>` (`i18n/src/useSafeTranslation.ts`). An
 * `unknown`-typed sink SWALLOWS the diagnostic, so an inventory built from
 * compiler errors cannot reach this site — it has to be found by hand. After a
 * widening, `tsc` finds the typed readers; `t()` options, `String(…)`, template
 * literals and `JSON.stringify` do not report.
 *
 * ── What goes wrong when it is missed ─────────────────────────────────────
 * `detailTitle` is handed to `NavigationOverlay`'s `title` prop (three call
 * sites in `ObjectGrid.tsx`), which means it IS the visible heading of the
 * record-detail drawer/modal/split/popover — not a diagnostic, not a log line.
 * An unresolved map interpolates as `[object Object]`, on BOTH i18n paths:
 * i18next substitutes the raw value into `'{{label}} Detail'`, and the
 * provider-less fallback runs it through `String(v)`
 * (`i18n/src/fallbackInterpolation.ts`). So the user-visible heading reads
 * `[object Object] Detail`.
 *
 * ── Direction of these assertions (red-first) ─────────────────────────────
 * The map cases were RED before the fix (`[object Object] Detail`) and are
 * GREEN after (`Accounts Detail` / `联系人详情`). The STRING cases were GREEN
 * before AND after: they are the control that must not move — resolving a plain
 * string through `resolveI18nLabel` returns it unchanged, so English (and every
 * other) output on the string arm is byte-identical to what objectui#3426 left.
 *
 * The provider-LESS half of the same fix is asserted in
 * `ObjectGrid.overlayTitleNoProviderFallback.test.tsx`. It cannot live in this
 * file: `createI18n` registers its instance as react-i18next's module-global
 * default and that registration survives `cleanup()`, so a "no provider" render
 * here would silently resolve against whichever locale a previous test mounted.
