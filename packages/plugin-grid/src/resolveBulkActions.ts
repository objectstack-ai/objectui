/**
 * Resolve a list view's `bulkActions: string[]` against the object's declared
 * actions, folding each resolvable name into the rich `BulkActionDef` list the
 * selection bar renders.
 *
 * This is the selection-scoped twin of {@link resolveLegacyRowActions}
 * (objectui#2960 / #2996), and it closes the same `{type: <name>}` dead end on
 * the bulk path (objectui#3002): dispatching `bulkActions: ['push_down']` put
 * the action's NAME in the runner's `type` slot, which resolves to nothing —
 * zero requests, and (since #2996) a loud failure instead of a green toast.
 *
 * ## Where a bulk action is declared
 *
 * **In the VIEW's `bulkActions`, naming an action the object declares.** That
 * is the whole vocabulary. `ActionSchema.bulkEnabled` looked like an
 * object-level alternative and this module briefly derived from it, but spec
 * 17.0.0 retired the key (objectstack-ai/objectstack#3896 close-out / framework#4054) — it is now a
 * `retiredKey()` tombstone, so authoring it is a HARD parse rejection whose
 * own prescription is: *"the multi-select toolbar is driven by the LIST VIEW's
 * `bulkActions` / `bulkActionDefs`, never by this flag … declare the action in
 * the view's `bulkActions` instead."* Do not reintroduce a `bulkEnabled` read
 * here: `defineStack` refuses to compile a config that sets it, so the branch
 * can never run.
 *
 * `locations` stays orthogonal — it places an action's SINGLE-record entry
 * (toolbar / row kebab / record header). One action can be both: declared
 * `locations: ['list_item']` AND named in `bulkActions`, it runs on one row
 * from the kebab and on N rows from the selection bar.
 *
 * ## Two vocabularies reach the selection bar
 *
 *  1. `bulkActionDefs` — rich defs authored inline in the view JSON. Left
 *     as-authored, with ONE narrowly-scoped exception: a def carrying
 *     `execution: 'aggregate'` and no inline `actionDef` resolves its `name`
 *     against `objectDef.actions` and gets the matched action attached (see
 *     below). They own their names and win every collision either way.
 *  2. `bulkActions: string[]` — bare action names, resolved against
 *     `objectDef.actions` and PROMOTED to that def, so they carry the action's
 *     label, icon, `visible` predicate, `requiredPermissions` gate, confirm text
 *     and params instead of a bare humanized name. The bare-string form always promotes to the
 *     per-record dispatch — it has nowhere to carry an `execution` flag, so
 *     aggregate mode (objectui#3139) requires the authored-def form above.
 *
 * A promoted def carries `operation: 'custom'` plus the source action under
 * {@link BulkActionDef.actionDef}: it is NOT a data-plane mass update, it is
 * one action run over N records through the action runner. `useBulkExecutor`
 * routes on exactly that key — a `custom` def WITHOUT `actionDef` keeps its
 * historical no-op-per-row meaning (callout handled by the consumer's
 * `onComplete`).
 *
 * Names that resolve to nothing stay in `unresolved` and are still dispatched
 * by name: consumers may have registered a runner handler under exactly that
 * name (`runner.registerHandler('my_action', …)`), and that path must keep
 * working. When no such handler exists the runner reports the dead end rather
 * than toasting success (#2996).

/**
 * Is this authored `bulkActionDefs` member a def the selection bar can render?

 * "Usable" is defined by WHAT THE RENDERER READS, not by a fresh opinion about
 * what a def ought to carry: `BulkActionBar` uses `def.name` twice — as the
 * React `key` of the button it maps to, and as the argument to
 * `formatActionLabel` when the def declares no `label`. A member without a
 * non-empty string `name` therefore has no identity and no label, and
 * `formatActionLabel(undefined)` threw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of
 * undefined (reading 'replace')` DURING RENDER — taking the whole selection bar
 * down on the author's first multi-row selection (objectui#8730).
 *
 * Every other `BulkActionDef` key is optional at the read site (an absent
 * `operation` falls through to the button's default treatment, an absent
 * `visible` means ungated), so `name` is the whole predicate. It covers the
 * reported bare string and, by the same test, `null`, a number, `{}` and
 * `{ name: '' }`.
 *
 * ⛔ NOT a coercion. A bare `'approve'` is NOT lifted into `{ name: 'approve' }`
 * and resolved the way `bulkActions` is: that would make the two vocabularies
 * interchangeable, which is a product change to what a `bulkActionDefs` member
 * MEANS (objectui#3002 / objectui#3139 established them as two vocabularies
 * deliberately), not a crash fix. The member is skipped, and said out loud.
