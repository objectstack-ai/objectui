 * objectui#11572 — an interface page relays its source view's `tree` and
 * `chart` blocks, and its own `allowPrinting`.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * An ADR-0047 interface page builds ONE list schema itself, hand-projecting
 * keys off the view its `interfaceConfig.sourceView` resolves to. The
 * visualization comes from `appearance.allowedVisualizations`, and the spec's
 * `VisualizationTypeSchema` admits `tree` and `chart`, so a page may whitelist
 * either and `viewType` becomes that kind. But the projection carried the
 * per-kind blocks of `kanban`, `calendar`, `gallery`, `timeline`, `gantt` and
 * `map` only. A stored `{ type: 'tree', tree: { parentField: 'parent_id' } }`
 * row (the block the console's `CreateViewDialog` writes) reached `ListView`
 * with `viewType: 'tree'` and no `tree`, so the tree branch never saw its
 * `parentField`; a `chart` row lost its block the same way. The object page
 * relays both, so one stored view rendered two ways.
 *
 * The page config's own `allowPrinting` ("Allow users to print the page",
 * declared on `InterfacePageConfigSchema`) was dropped the same way: `ListView`
 * draws its print button off `schema.allowPrinting`, and nothing on this page
 * wrote it. The census beside this file
 * (`InterfaceListPage.relayCensus-11572.test.ts`) is what found it.
 *
 * ## What the relay carries, and what it does not decide
 *
 * The declared block, verbatim, as `kanban` / `timeline` are carried. There is
 * no page-derived default for either kind — nothing here can guess a parent
 * pointer or a measure — so the `derives(kind)` rule (objectui#10380) has
 * nothing to gate, and a whitelisted kind with no declared block reaches
 * `ListView` with no block at all, exactly as before. How the block then
 * renders (`schema.tree || schema.options.tree`, and the chart binding) is
 * `plugin-list`'s half, pinned there, and not re-pinned here.
 *
 * ## Why the schema is captured rather than rendered
 *
 * The claim is about what THIS page hands down, so `ListView` is stubbed and
 * its `schema` prop recorded — the posture of
 * `InterfaceListPage.viewFieldKeysRelay-10638.test.tsx`.
