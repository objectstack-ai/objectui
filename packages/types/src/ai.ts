   * `AIFormAssist` takes `({ schema, onApply, onRefresh })` and never reads
   * `formId`: the key named a form nothing looked up. Measured on the retiring
   * branch's own head, whole package: zero occurrences of the identifier in
   * `AIFormAssist.tsx`, with the sibling `showConfidence` (2 occurrences: the
   * destructure and its read) lit as the control, and zero `{...props}` /
   * `{...rest}` spreads anywhere in `@object-ui/plugin-ai` — the
   * `SchemaRenderer` prop channel objectui#8410 found (a renderer consuming a
   * key it never names) does not exist in this package, with
   * `components/src/renderers/disclosure/collapsible.tsx` lit as that
   * instrument's control.
   *
   * A tombstone rather than a plain removal on PRONG 2 of the discriminator
   * (objectui#5941, #7526, #7678): this package's README taught the key as
   * working, in the Quick Start, in the `AIFormAssist` API example and in the
   * schema-driven JSON example. {@link BaseSchema} carries `[key: string]: any`,
   * so a DELETED member is absorbed silently at ANY value — deletion here is not
   * a quieter refusal, it is no refusal — and the tombstone is what makes the
   * compile-time refusal exist, by name.
   *
   * ⛔ Not enforced instead (the ruling's words): implementing reads nobody asked
   * for is capability growth without pull. If an AI backend later needs the
   * form's identity as context, that is a feature card with its own business
   * case.
