/**
 * objectui#8266 — the series binding both dashboard relays compose for an
 * object-bound aggregate.
 *
 * ## What was measured before the fix (origin/main `0fa7a9c83`)
 *
 * A widget with `provider: 'object'` and `aggregate: { function: 'count',
 * groupBy: 'status' }` — no `field`, the normal way to author "how many records
 * per status" — composed `series: [{ dataKey: 'value' }]` on BOTH relays, while
 * the rows an object-bound fieldless count carries are keyed `'count'` (the
 * alias the engine projects `COUNT(*)` under; pinned since framework#3701 by
 * `plugin-charts/src/ObjectChart.aggregateResultColumns.test.ts`).
 *
 * The picture that produced is measured in the sibling file
 * `plugin-charts/src/ObjectChart.countSeriesKeyRender-8266.test.tsx`, because a
 * seam assertion cannot tell a honoured `dataKey` from an ignored one and
 * `recharts` resolves inside `plugin-charts` alone. Short version: a
 * `.recharts-surface` with the category ticks drawn, ZERO marks, no refusal and
 * no empty state — indistinguishable from "this object has no rows".
 *
 * ## Why the recorder rather than the real chart
 *
 * The decision under test is which column the RELAY names, and it is spelled
 * twice — `DashboardGridLayout` and `DashboardRenderer` each compose their own
 * `object-chart` node. Registering a recorder for the two component types those
 * nodes resolve to reads exactly that, from the real render path, for both
 * surfaces, without depending on anything the chart layer does afterwards.
 *
 * ## The third spelling, settled
 *
 * `DashboardGridLayout` and `DashboardRenderer` each ALSO build
 * `series: [{ dataKey: yField }]` from the RAW `yField` twenty-odd lines below
 * the aggregate site. That is a different branch, not a third spelling of one
 * decision: it is reached only after `isObjectProvider` returns false, for a
 * widget whose rows are an AUTHORED literal array. There is no aggregate to
 * consult there and the author's `yField` names a column in their own rows, so
 * it must keep reading `yField` — which the last describe block pins, in both
 * directions, so a future "unify the two" refactor cannot quietly break it.
