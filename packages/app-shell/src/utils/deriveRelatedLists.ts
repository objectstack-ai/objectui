/**
 * deriveRelatedLists — the read-side mirror of `attachInlineSubforms`.
 *
 * Where `inlineEdit: true` on a child's `master_detail`/`lookup` field pulls
 * that child INTO the parent's entry form (write side), the detail-page
 * RELATED LIST is the read-side counterpart: a child collection surfaced on the
 * parent's record DETAIL page. Both intents live on the relationship in the
 * data model — not in a hand-authored page.
 *
 * This helper scans every object for fields whose `reference`/`reference_to`
 * points back at the parent object and produces one related-list descriptor per
 * eligible FK. The detail page (`RecordDetailView`) feeds these into the
 * `record:related_list` renderers. (It also fed `DetailView.related`, which is
 * RETIRED as of objectui#7997 — that entry is a `?: never` tombstone on both
 * faces now, and this helper's output reaches the page only as
 * `record:related_list` nodes.)
 *
 * Rules (kept in lockstep with the relationship-level `relatedList` spec flag):
 *   - Owned children (`master_detail`) and `lookup` children are SHOWN by
 *     default. Set `relatedList: false` on the FK field to suppress a noisy
 *     association/audit link; set `relatedList: 'primary'` to mark a CORE
 *     relationship — the detail page promotes it to its own tab (the tab-vs-
 *     Related split is decided downstream in `buildDefaultTabs`).
 *   - `relatedListTitle` / `relatedListColumns` on the FK field override the
 *     derived title / columns (columns default to the child object's own list
 *     columns when omitted — resolved by the renderer).
 *   - `relatedListFilter` on the FK field is the list's own declared SCOPE
 *     (objectui#4664; the spec key landed upstream as objectstack#8704 / PR
 *     #8955 and ships from `@objectstack/spec` 17.1.0). It is carried through
 *     to the `record:related_list` node's existing `filter` prop, where
 *     `RelatedList` AND-composes it with `{ [referenceField]: parentId }`
 *     (objectstack#7118) — the parent condition is never negotiable, so the
 *     declared filter may only NARROW this parent's children.
 *   - ROW ORDER is inherited from the child object's DEFAULT LIST VIEW `sort`
 *     (objectui#5795). There is deliberately no field-level `relatedListSort`
 *     to pair with the keys above: the contract question was ruled on
 *     objectstack#11345 (maintainer, 2026-08-23) as direction 1 — inherit the
 *     child's list-view sort, and add NO new spec key. A related list is just
 *     another surface that lists that object, so it orders the way that
 *     object's own list orders, exactly as `columns` already defaults.
 *   - Audit FKs (`created_by` / `updated_by` / `owner_id`) are skipped — they
 *     exist on virtually every object and would balloon the detail page into
 *     dozens of duplicate cards.
 *   - ONE related list per eligible FK. A child may point at the parent through
 *     MORE THAN ONE relationship (e.g. `opportunity.primary_account` +
 *     `opportunity.partner_account`); each surfaces as its own list. When a
 *     child appears more than once and gave no explicit `relatedListTitle`, the
 *     FK's label is suffixed to disambiguate ("Opportunity · Partner Account").
 *   - Self-references are allowed (e.g. `account.parent_account` → `account`):
 *     the parent record lists the records whose self-FK points back at it
 *     ("Child Accounts"). Suppress with `relatedList: false` if unwanted.
 *   - Owned (`master_detail`) children are ordered before plain `lookup`
 *     children, preserving discovery order within each group.
 *   - Object-level READ permission gates the whole list (objectui#2359): the
 *     relationship graph says nothing about the CURRENT USER, so callers pass
 *     a `canRead` predicate (wired from `usePermissions().can`) and children
 *     the user cannot read are dropped — no header, no empty grid, no "New"
 *     button that would 403 on save. Data access was always enforced
 *     server-side; this closes the UI/DX gap.
