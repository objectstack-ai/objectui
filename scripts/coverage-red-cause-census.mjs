/**
 * Census: why the push lane's coverage gate was red, run by run — objectui#8545.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is a ONE-OFF CENSUS, not a gate. It is deliberately NOT wired into any
 * workflow, it never fails a build, and nothing in CI calls it. It exists so the
 * numbers objectui#8545 publishes stay REPRODUCIBLE from a file instead of being
 * claims about a deleted scratch script. ⛔ Do not add it to `.github/workflows`
 * without answering, on a card, what it would be gating.
 *
 * Run:
 *   NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 node scripts/coverage-red-cause-census.mjs --fetch --since=2026-09-02 > snap.json
 *   node scripts/coverage-red-cause-census.mjs --snapshot=snap.json
 *
 * `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` is not decoration on a proxied host: Node's built-in
 * `fetch` ignores `HTTPS_PROXY`, so `--fetch` answers 403 on the very first
 * page and the 403 reads exactly like a permissions problem. Measured on Node
 * v22.22.2. The `--snapshot` path needs no network at all.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE QUESTION
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * objectui#6055 measured that a large share of push-lane merges were red at the
 * coverage gate, and said plainly that this was a CORRELATION between two
 * measurements — it never classified those failures by cause. This file is that
 * classification.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE DELIVERY PROBE — artifact presence, ⛔ never a run-level conclusion
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A run is "red at the coverage gate" when the `coverage-report` artifact is
 * ABSENT from it. objectui#6055 re-confirmed independently that a run's
 * `conclusion` is NOT a delivery proxy: it found `conclusion=cancelled` runs
 * that had nevertheless delivered the artifact. `deliveredCoverageReport()`
 * below is therefore the only admissible probe, and `conclusion` is carried in
 * the snapshot for reporting only.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE CAUSE CANNOT BE READ OFF A JOB LOG — the resolution limit, stated
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The push lane runs `pnpm test:coverage --reporter=blob …` (ci.yml, the
 * `test-coverage` job). `--reporter=blob` REPLACES the default reporter set, so
 * a failing shard's job log contains no failing-test names, no assertion text
 * and no `Test timed out in 15000ms` line: it goes from whatever the tests
 * themselves printed on stdout straight to `blob report written to …` and
 * `ELIFECYCLE Command failed with exit code 1`. The failures do exist, inside
 * the `coverage-blob-N` artifact — which is downloadable only, not readable
 * through the API.
 *
 * ⇒ per-run failing-test identity is NOT recoverable from CI. This census
 * therefore classifies by the two readings that ARE recoverable, and says so
 * rather than inferring a cause from "it was red and something was slow":
 *
 *   (1) WHICH SHARD failed, paired with WHICH SHARD a named suspect file
 *       computes into on that exact tree — `shardOf()` below is a replica of
 *       vitest's own sequencer, so this is arithmetic on the tree, not a guess.
 *   (2) WHETHER THE SAME TREE PASSED UNINSTRUMENTED, from the `merge_group`
 *       lane, which runs the same 4-way split over the same files without
 *       `--coverage` (ci.yml gives `test` `if: github.event_name != 'push'`).
 *
 * ⚠️ Reading (2) has a selection trap that has to be named: a commit only lands
 * if its merge_group run went green, so "every landed sha had a green
 * merge_group run" is TAUTOLOGICAL and proves nothing on its own. What is NOT
 * tautological is the merge_group runs that FAILED — those trees never landed,
 * and they are in the data. Comparing the per-shard failure RATE of the two
 * lanes over the same period is the reading that carries weight.
