 * Agreement pin — the retire-vs-remove discriminator (objectui#9684).
 *
 * The rule this file guards is the retire-vs-remove discriminator the precedent
 * changesets state (objectui#5941, #7526) in the form objectui#7678 amended it
 * to. ⛔ It is NOT quoted here — it is stated in `../complex.ts`, at FOUR sites,
 * and the one `../mobile.ts` cites is on `ChatbotSchema`; read it there. The
 * `describe` blocks below fail if that one moves and if the four stop agreeing.
 *
 * ⭐ This file used to quote the rule and claim in the same sentence that it did
 * not restate it — and the quotation matched this file's own
 * `STATES_THE_RULE`, so the tree carried five statements while the pin guarded
 * four and the fifth denied being one (measured at the third in-seat review;
 * `sourceFiles` skips `__tests__`, so deleting the precondition from that
 * header passed). The claim is now enforced on this file rather than asserted
 * about it: see the `describe` that reads this very source.
 *
 * ## Why a pin and not a comment
 *
 * The rule was written out in full at eight sites across `../complex.ts` and
 * `../mobile.ts`. objectui#7678's amendment then had to be applied by hand at
 * every one of them, and the sites do not reference each other — so a missed
 * site went RED nowhere. Measured on objectui#9684's base: two of the eight
 * still lacked the precondition, both in `../mobile.ts`, and the finding that
 * measured the drift enumerated the population with a literal-phrase grep over
 * two hand-picked files and named neither of them — one is a paraphrase the
 * grep cannot see. ⇒ the failure mode is silence, and silence is what this
 * file removes.
 *
 * ## What it enforces, and what it cannot
 *
 * 1. Any comment block in this package that states the rule GENERICALLY must
 *    carry the precondition IN RULE VOICE — `CARRIES_PRECONDITION` reads the
 *    rule's own phrasings, ⛔ not the words "no carrier" wherever they fall in
 *    the block. That distinction is not pedantry: it was measured at the second
 *    in-seat review that an un-amended statement passed because its per-
 *    retirement ARGUMENT said "there is no carrier", while the same defect
 *    worded "no surviving object" was flagged.
 * 2. `../mobile.ts` states the rule NOWHERE — no prong, no clause, nothing that
 *    matches `STATES_THE_RULE`. ⛔ Not "does not write the prongs out", which
 *    is what this asserted while claiming the wider thing: a note restating the
 *    precondition with the prongs left unwritten passed, and put that file back
 *    on the amendment surface for that clause.
 * 3. The citation target still exists and still states the rule.
 * 4. `../complex.ts` states the rule at EXACTLY the recorded sites, and each
 *    carries exactly the clauses `CLAUSES` names, per the roster in
 *    `SURVIVING_STATEMENTS`. ⭐ 1 alone does NOT give this: a third prong added
 *    to the `ChatbotSchema` statement and nowhere else passed this file when 1
 *    was all there was. ⭐ And the count is exact because `>= 4` let a FIFTH
 *    fully amended statement pass, which made the "four sites" written here, in
 *    the `../mobile.ts` preamble and in the changeset a figure nothing
 *    re-derived (AGENTS.md #9).
 *
 * ⚠️ What re-derives what: the population below is derived at run time from
 * the source, so a site added later is covered without anyone remembering this
 * file. But it is derived by MARKERS, and a statement that paraphrases past all
 * of them is invisible here exactly as it was to the grep on the card. The
 * vacuity control is what keeps that honest in one direction: the population in
 * `../complex.ts` is asserted to be exactly the roster, so markers that stop
 * matching fail loudly instead of passing on a short set.
 *
 * ⛔ What remains silent, stated as the PATTERNS and ⛔ no longer as a summary
 * of them. A third prong is caught when it is written `prong 3`, `third prong`,
 * `(3)`, or as `or` followed by `3`, `iii`, `third` or `thirdly` — and it is
 * SILENT in any other numbering, `or (c)` and `or (four)` among them, and
 * silent when it numbers nothing at all. A whole statement worded past every
 * `STATES_THE_RULE` marker is silent too. ⚠️ The summary this replaces said the
 * silent case was "a clause that numbers nothing": measured at the third
 * in-seat review, `(iii)`, `3.` and `thirdly` each number something and each
 * passed, so a reader amending the rule in that style believed the roster held
 * the other three sites. ⇒ when you amend the rule, add the clause here; when
 * you add a site, add the marker; and when you widen a pattern, rewrite this
 * paragraph rather than the sentence that summarises it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Markers are matched against the block with its comment punctuation and
 * line wrapping flattened. Matching raw lines is what makes a phrase probe miss
 * a hit that happens to wrap — measured on this card: the precondition clause
 * breaks across two lines at two of the four published sites, with the line end
 * falling inside the two-word name of the carrier condition, and `grep -inE`
 * over that file reports both as misses.
 * Which spans are comment at all is answered by `scripts/js-comment-mask.mjs`,
 * the one scanner in this tree that knows a string literal from a comment, and
 * ⛔ never by a private regex over the source.
 *
 * ## The `.d.ts` asymmetry this pin records structurally
 *
 * `../complex.ts` states the rule in JSDoc on exported members, which
 * declaration emit carries into the published `.d.ts`; `../mobile.ts`'s notes
 * are `//` comments, which it does not. ⛔ The dividing line is the comment
 * FORM, not where the comment sits: a `//` comment placed directly above an
 * exported declaration with no blank line also reaches the emitted `.d.ts`
 * zero times, measured on objectui#9684 — so "at module scope", which this
 * header and the changeset both said, named the wrong cause. That asymmetry is
 * why the two files are treated differently — a citation costs a consumer of
 * the published declarations nothing in one file and a jump in the other. The
 * structural half of the contrast (JSDoc vs `//`) is asserted below. ⛔ The reading of the
 * emitted `.d.ts` itself is NOT re-derived by anything here or in CI: it was
 * taken once, on objectui#9684, and the PR body prints the command to re-take
 * it.
