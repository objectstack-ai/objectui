/**
 * The seam half of objectui#7472: `@object-ui/cli` GENERATES code that imports
 * this package's icon seam, and nothing else can notice when that breaks.
 *
 * `packages/cli/src/utils/app-generator.ts` emits a `src/Layout.tsx` into the
 * user's application. Since objectui#7472 that file writes
 *
 *     import { …, LazyIcon, isLucideIconName } from '@object-ui/components';
 *
 * instead of rolling its own lucide lookup, which is what objectui#5935's
 * ruling requires of every container — verbatim and untranslated, because the
 * wording is the operative clause:
 *
 *     「本裁定后新容器 ⛔ 不得再自带解析器,一律走 seam」
 *
 * WHY THE TEST IS HERE AND NOT THERE. Two constraints meet:
 *
 *  1. The generated app's own `tsc` run cannot judge this import. Nothing
 *     installs the temp app's dependencies, so `@object-ui/*` does not resolve
 *     and those diagnostics are deliberately exempt (see the type-check gate's
 *     header in `packages/cli/src/__tests__/app-generator.test.ts`). A rename
 *     here would sail through it.
 *  2. The CLI's test file may not import this package by its specifier.
 *     `@object-ui/cli` declares `@object-ui/components` as a RUNTIME dependency
 *     for a reason no scanner can see, and that reason is carried by a
 *     `DECLARED_WITHOUT_IMPORT` row in `scripts/check-unused-dependencies.mjs`;
 *     a package import from the CLI's own `src/` would make the row stale and
 *     erase the only written record of why the declaration is not a
 *     devDependency.
 *
 * ⇒ The names cross the package boundary as DATA. The list below is pinned
 * identically in `app-generator.test.ts` ("names exactly the icons the seam-side
 * contract test puts through the seam"), so the two cannot drift apart in
 * silence: whichever side moves first goes red naming the other.
 *
 * ⛔ This file does not widen `scripts/check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs`, and
 * nothing here argues that it should. The generated template sits outside that
 * census by construction — it is emitted from inside a template literal, it
 * used a namespace import, and its lookup base was a property access — so its
 * absence from `DECLARED_RECORD_READERS` was correct rather than a miss. The
 * template was the thing that diverged, and it is the thing that moved.
