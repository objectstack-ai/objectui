 * objectui#8415 — `FilterBuilderConditionSchema` declares `id`.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * The mirror declared a condition as `{ field, operator, value? }`. The
 * component's identity for a row is `id`, and because the mirror is a plain
 * `z.object`, an author who wrote `id` correctly had it STRIPPED in silence.
 * The document then validated and the row rendered — and from then on the row
 * had no individual identity. All four mutation helpers match on `c.id`, every
 * one of them is handed `undefined`, and `undefined === undefined` is TRUE, so
 * each matches EVERY id-less row: `removeCondition` deletes them all in one
 * click (the clicked row included; only uuid-bearing rows survive), and
 * `updateCondition` / `changeOperator` / `changeField` fan one edit out across
 * all of them. `key={condition.id}` becomes `key={undefined}`, which React
 * reads as no key at all rather than as a duplicate one.
 *
 * ⛔ Not "matches none" — the failure is EN BLOC, and it is the more severe of
 * the two readings.
 *
 * Measured on the base commit, through `FilterBuilderConditionSchema.safeParse`:
 * a condition carrying `id` parsed successfully and the parsed OUTPUT did not
 * carry the key. That is the `accepted-and-discarded` class objectui#6150
 * closed for `tree-view.title`, not a refusal.
 *
 * ## Why REQUIRED, and why that is not the answer the GROUP got
 *
 * ⛔ The two `id`s look alike and take OPPOSITE answers — do not unify them.
 *
 *   - `FilterGroupSchema.id` is declared OPTIONAL (objectui#7560): `isValidGroup`
 *     never consults it, nothing reads `filterGroup.id`, and deleting it from an
 *     authored group renders byte-identically. Requiring it would invent a
 *     refusal the renderer does not make.
 *   - A CONDITION's `id` is the opposite reading. `assertion the four match
 *     sites and the React key are live` below re-derives it from the component
 *     source rather than quoting a count.
 *
 * ⭐ The narrowing therefore refuses only what is ALREADY broken: a condition
 * with no `id` renders today but cannot be edited or removed INDIVIDUALLY —
 * every affordance on it acts on all the id-less rows at once. Nothing that
 * works stops working.
