/**
 * The MEMBERS of `object-timeline.navigation`, pinned at what the TIMELINE
 * reads (objectui#8654).
 *
 * objectui#8654 declares `navigation` on this block — on the schema
 * `ObjectTimelineProps` reads and in the registration `inputs` of both tags
 * (`object-timeline` and `view:timeline`) — as the timeline arm of the
 * maintainer's objectui#8652 ruling 「B」, whose platform half is
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.5.0 declaring the key on this element. An
 * `object`-armed input owes a member pin (objectui#8212), and this file is it:
 * every member is driven through a real entry click on the real
 * `ObjectTimeline`, with the real `useNavigationOverlay` and the real overlay
 * shell, and each row asserts what the click DID. Modelled on the board's
 * `kanbanNavigationMembers-8652`.
 *
 * ⚠️ The gate that will read this file does not read it yet:
 * `registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts` books `object-timeline` as UNJUDGED,
 * owed to objectui#11168 slice 3, which loads the lazily registered block. Its
 * member-pin check refuses an entry for a block it does not judge, so the
 * `MEMBER_PINS` line pointing here is slice 3's to add.
 *
 * What the rows establish:
 *
 *   - **`drawer`, `modal` and `popover` open the entry's record** in that
 *     overlay. `drawer` is the LIT CONTROL every "nothing happened" row below
 *     leans on.
 *   - **`none` and `preventNavigation` open nothing**, and the flag outranks an
 *     overlay mode.
 *   - **`new_window` and `openNewTab` open the record page in a new tab**,
 *     built from the block's own object name; `openNewTab` outranks `page`.
 *   - **`size` and `width` are ONE decision**: `width` (deprecated) wins over a
 *     `size` beside it, a bucket name resolves through the size table, and
 *     `auto` lands where a drawer with no size does.
 *   - **A parent view's click handler outranks the whole key.**
 *
 * ⚠️ And the values the timeline does NOT honour on its own, pinned because
 * the registration's description states them and a description is a claim
 * about this renderer. Unlike the board and the calendar, this renderer
 * supplies no drawer default, so an ABSENT key opens nothing; `page`, and a
 * block written without `mode` (the spec's `page` default), open nothing on a
 * timeline no parent view navigates for (objectui#11293); and `split` opens
 * nothing, because the timeline hands the split shell no main panel. A
 * timeline that learns any of these reddens its row, and the fix is to rewrite
 * that description with it, ⛔ not to relax the row.
