/**
 * object-aggregate-query — the ONE answer to "which CALL does an object-bound
 * `aggregate` make when its authored `groupBy` is the structured node?"
 * (objectui#8613).
 *
 * ## The two wires, and why the choice is not cosmetic
 *
 * An authored `aggregate.groupBy` is a union: a bare field name, or the
 * structured date-bucketing node `{ field, dateGranularity?, alias? }` — the
 * union `ChartGroupBySchema` declares and `GroupByNodeSchema` (the query AST)
 * mirrors. The adapter routes on the SHAPE of the params it is handed, not on
 * the shape of the authored value:
 *
 *   - `{ groupBy: GroupByNode[], aggregations, where }` — the spec-shape query,
 *     which reaches `engine.aggregate` and runs the server-side date-bucket
 *     engine;
 *   - `{ field, function, groupBy, filter }` — the legacy cube/analytics query,
 *     whose `dimensions` the contract declares as an array of dimension NAMES
 *     and which does NOT honour `dateGranularity` at all.
 *
 * So a structured node forwarded on the legacy wire is posted as a dimension
 * OBJECT where a name is declared: the author asks for monthly buckets and the
 * platform answers a different question, with no diagnostic on the way. That is
 * the defect objectui#8613 records on the metric path, and it was reachable
 * there only because this payload was spelled INSIDE one renderer
 * (`ObjectChart.runAggregate`) rather than anywhere a second renderer could
 * reuse it.
 *
 * ## Why a shared module rather than a second copy
 *
 * The alternative was to transcribe the eight lines into the metric widget.
 * That is the objectui#5042 / #7544 / #8193 / #8266 / #8269 drift shape — a
 * second opinion of one question, with nothing keeping the two in agreement —
 * and it is the same shape those cards' fixes (`chartMeasureKey`,
 * `chartCategoryKey`) exist to end, one column at a time. This module is that
 * move applied to the REQUEST rather than to a result column.
 *
 * ## What is NOT here
 *
 * The legacy bag itself. The two renderers do not agree on it and should not be
 * made to: a chart passes the authored `groupBy` through untouched, while a
 * metric floors an absent one at `'_all'` (one bucket) because it paints a
 * single number. Folding that difference into a shared builder would put a
 * renderer's own default into a module that has no business holding one, so the
 * shared part stops exactly where the agreement stops.
