/**
 * objectui#7401 — a chart-type registration draws the family it names.
 *
 * ## What was broken
 *
 * `pie-chart`, `donut-chart`, `radar-chart` and `scatter-chart` declared their
 * family as `defaultProps: { chartType: … }` on the registration, and
 * **nothing on the SDUI path has ever read a registration's `defaultProps`**.
 * `ChartRenderer` computed `schema.chartType ?? spec.chartType` — both
 * `undefined` — and `AdvancedChartImpl` fell to its `'bar'` default. Four
 * documented component types were one family, on valid data, with no
 * `data-chart-error` that could fire. The card's measurement, which the
 * `renders as itself` block below reproduces as a REGRESSION table:
 *
 *   | schema `type`                    | scatter | bar | pie | refusal |
 *   |----------------------------------|--------:|----:|----:|---------|
 *   | `scatter-chart`                  |       0 |   2 |   0 | none    |
 *   | `plugin-charts:scatter-chart`    |       0 |   2 |   0 | none    |
 *   | `pie-chart`                      |       0 |   2 |   0 | none    |
 *
 * ⚠️ Since objectui#10859 batch 8 (phase 2b) `scatter-chart` is RETIRED: its
 * registration and its `CHART_TYPE_KEYWORD_FAMILIES` row are gone, and the
 * scatter family is reached as `{ type: 'chart', chartType: 'scatter' }`. The
 * two scatter rows of the table above are the card's historical measurement;
 * the scatter cases below pin the retirement and the spelling that draws.
 *
 * ## Why these render through the REAL SDUI path
 *
 * The defect lived between the registry and the renderer, so a unit test on
 * either side of that seam could not see it — `normalizeChartSchema` was
 * asked the right question and `AdvancedChartImpl` gave the right answer for
 * the family it was handed. Only a schema going in through `SchemaRenderer`
 * with the package's own registrations live reproduces it, which is also the
 * form the card measured in.
 *
 * ## Ruled route C (director seat, 2026-09-06, on maintainer authorisation)
 *
 * The family is derived from the schema's own `type`, and the five inert
 * `defaultProps: { chartType: … }` are removed rather than left beside a
 * mechanism that works (`AGENTS.md` #0.1). ⛔ A/B are closed: A (activating
 * registration `defaultProps` on the SDUI path generally) is a feature with a
 * measured 32-site / 12-package blast radius and is its own card.
