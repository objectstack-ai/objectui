/**
 * Client-side evaluation of the **list-view conditional tier** — conditional
 * formatting and row-action visibility — on the canonical CEL engine.
 *
 * B2 (ADR-0036) moved *field-level* rules (`visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` /
 * `requiredWhen`) onto `@objectstack/formula`'s `ExpressionEngine`, evaluated
 * identically on the client and the server. The list tier historically stayed
 * on the legacy `ExpressionEvaluator` (a JS-dialect recursive-descent parser),
 * even though `@objectstack/spec` already types these surfaces as CEL
 * (`ListViewSchema.conditionalFormatting[].condition` and `ActionSchema.visible`
 * are `ExpressionInputSchema` → `{ dialect: 'cel', source }`). This module
 * converges them onto the same engine so the whole platform speaks one dialect
 * (framework ADR-0058, "one authoring language, one interpret backend").
 *
 * Two evaluation entry points:
 *   - {@link evalRowPredicate} — a single boolean predicate over a row record
 *     (row-action `visible` / `disabled`, or a formatting `condition`).
 *   - {@link resolveConditionalFormatting} — the one implementation of the
 *     three historical rule shapes, returning the first matching rule's style.
 *
 * **Dialect routing.** A predicate authored as the `{ dialect: 'cel', source }`
 * envelope is authoritative CEL and is *always* sent to the CEL engine. A bare
 * string is CEL per the spec contract, *unless* it carries legacy-only syntax
 * (`${…}` templating, `===`/`!==`, `?.` JS optional-chaining, JS string/array
 * methods) — those are routed to the legacy engine for back-compat and emit a
 * one-time deprecation warning, because such a string means something different
 * (or nothing) to the server's CEL engine.

 * objectui#5330, option B; Phase 2 executed by objectui#5741).
 *
 * Until Phase 2 the row was also bound as bare fields (`status`, the row-action
 * shorthand) and as `data.*`, and Phase 1 (PR #5737) warned once per
 * non-canonical spelling. Both bindings and that warning are gone. A bare-field
 * or `data.*` predicate on a record surface now FAULTS here exactly as it always
 * did on the server — measured on `@objectstack/formula@17.1.0`,
 * `buildScope({ record })` mounts exactly `['record']`, so a bare field faults
 * `Unknown variable: status` and `data.*` faults `Unknown variable: data` — and
 * takes this function's EXISTING fault policy: the caller's `fallback`, reported
 * once by `warnEvalError` (when `warnOnError` is set) or by the canonical
 * helper's own one-time warning, either of which names the unknown variable.
 * Nothing detects a retired spelling on this path; it is simply unbound. The
 * same holds on the legacy `${…}` path below — one scope shape per surface,
 * both dialects — so `${data.x}` / `${x}` strings on a row surface fault there
 * too, and land in the same fallback / warning.
 *
 * The retirement is scoped to the RUNTIME RECORD layer. `data` is the canonical
 * root one layer over, in a metadata-editing form (ADR-0089 D3,
 * `CANONICAL_ROOT_BY_LAYER` = `{ runtime: 'record', metadata: 'data' }`), and
 * that layer evaluates through its own entry (`app-shell`'s metadata-admin
 * `predicate.ts`), never through this one. See {@link ./rowPredicateCanon.ts}
 * for the canon statement, the server measurement and the offline detector.
 *
 * The optional `scope` (host predicate scope) is bound alongside so
 * `features.*` / `user.*` predicates keep working — but the row is the subject:
 * `record` always names THIS row, on both dialect paths, even when the host
 * scope carries a key of that name (objectui#3796). Every OTHER host key —
 * a host's own `data` included — reaches the predicate as the host's own.
 *
 * A caller with no row at all passes {@link RowPredicateOptions.rowless}, and
 * then nothing is bound over the scope — see that option for why an absent row

 *     `useCondition` / `useRowPredicate` do. Handing `true` to the engine
 *     produces `{ dialect: 'cel', source: undefined }`, which faults and — on

 *     resulting exclusion diagnosable once per predicate instead of silent.
 *
 * The fail-closed default is what separates this from a lenient record-free
 * evaluation, and the difference is not mere strictness: evaluated with NO
 * record bound, `record.status != 'paid'` returns `true` for every row —
 * including the ones it was written to exclude — so an authored gate is not
