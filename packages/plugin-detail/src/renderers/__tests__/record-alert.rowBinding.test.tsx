 * `record:alert` binds the row through the SHARED helper (objectui#4807), and
 * the helper binds `record.*` only (objectui#5741)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `record:alert` was the last predicate face in the repo still handing
 * `useCondition` a local ROOT-ONLY bag (`{ record }`) instead of the shared
 * `usePredicateRecordContext(record)` that objectui#4075 / #4077 put under the
 * four generic action renderers and app-shell's `DeclaredActionsBar`; #4807
 * moved it onto the helper. objectui#5330 (maintainer, 2026-08-20) then ruled
 * **B** — `record.*` is the canon, the row-action shorthand and legacy `data.*`
 * deprecated — and objectui#5741 (Phase 2, ruled 2026-09-02 / amended
 * 2026-09-05) retired them: the shared helper now binds `{ record: row }` and
 * nothing else, no survey, no special case. What this file measures is what
 * that looks like on THIS renderer, whose `useCondition` call is FAIL-SOFT:
 *
 *   • canon `record.*` gates the banner on the row — true on the matching row,
 *     false on the other.
 *   • row-action shorthand (`status == 'x'`) resolves NOTHING, so the evaluator
 *     throws `status is not defined` and this fail-soft site answers SHOWN on
 *     every row — the same verdict on both rows, i.e. the gate is not consulted.
 *     This is the pre-#4807 signature by design: it is the ruled cost of the
 *     retirement, and the console line is the notice.
 *   • legacy `data.*` does not throw: the ambient scope app-shell mounts
 *     (`providers/ExpressionProvider.tsx`) puts `data: {}` in the bag, and that
 *     `data` is the HOST's own, left standing, so `data.status` reads an
 *     undefined VALUE on the wrong object and the comparison is a constant
 *     `false` — the banner is OFF on every row, silently. Same retirement,
 *     opposite polarity, and no fault to report because nothing faulted.
 *
 * ── Why groups B and C mount different shapes ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * There are TWO gates on the way to this banner and they live at different
 * tiers, each with its own binding:
 *
 *   1. `SchemaRenderer`'s node chain. It hoists `properties.visible` onto the
 *      node and evaluates it on an evaluator that binds `record` (root-only)
 *      and, deliberately, `data` = the DATA-SOURCE ADAPTER — see the docblock
 *      on `SchemaRenderer.tsx`'s `evaluatedSchema`, which states that binding
 *      and why the row must not overwrite it.
 *   2. `record-alert.tsx`'s own `useCondition`, one layer below. THIS is the
 *      tier objectui#4075's rule governs and the tier this card fixes.
 *
 * The two compose as AND (pinned in `record-alert.visibleWhen.evidence.test.tsx`
 * group 4). Group B therefore holds gate 1 open with a declared
 * `visibleWhen: cel('true')` — the node chain tests `visibleWhen` FIRST and
 * returns without ever consulting `visible` — so that every verdict it records
 * is gate 2's, i.e. this renderer's. Group C then drops the isolation and mounts
 * the plain authored shape, so the end-to-end user-visible outcome is pinned too.
 *
 * Group C covers the canon and the shorthand only. The legacy `data.*` spelling
 * is NOT asserted end-to-end, and that is deliberate: through the plain shape
 * gate 1 decides it on the adapter binding above, one tier up and out of this
 * card's reach. Fixing this renderer does not (and must not) move that. See the
 * out-of-scope finding filed alongside this change.
 *
 * ── Non-vacuity ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This renderer has four `return null` paths (dismissed, empty record, the
 * props gate, and the node gate above it), so "nothing rendered" is not by
 * itself "the gate said no". Group A is the control: it proves the harness
 * really mounts and paints the banner, and that this exact channel can hide it.
 * Every verdict below is asserted on what a USER sees — is the banner's text in
 * the document — never on computed styles or a predicate's return value.
