/**
 * Field keys the ObjectStack spec REJECTS by name, stripped on read.
 *
 * Derived from the tombstone registry (`RETIRED_FIELD_KEY_TOMBSTONES` in
 * `@object-ui/types`, objectui#6527) — this door is the registry's
 * `metadataAdminFieldsReadDoor` site. The registry names each retired key, the
 * card that retired it, and which sites strip it; the per-key evidence lives
 * there. What stays HERE is this door's own contract:
 *
 * Every key this door strips is one a SHIPPED build wrote (verified per key,
 * objectui#6519), so a stored draft can still carry it inside a field —
 * `ObjectSchema.safeParse` reports it at `["fields", <name>]`, the hard 422
 * (`INVALID_METADATA`) that blocks EVERY subsequent save of the object, with
 * the writing controls retired and no UI path left to clear the key. Stripping
 * on load — not a data migration — is what makes an edit-and-save round-trip
 * of such a draft come out parseable. `readFields` is the single read door for
 * `draft.fields` across the whole object designer (inspector, form designer,
 * design surface, settings / validations / API panels), and `writeFields`
 * writes each def back verbatim, so one strip here covers every writer.
 * Nothing is lost on the way out: where the spec has a spelling for the
 * concept it is a SEPARATE key (`reference`, `system`) that is NOT stripped
 * and rides through untouched, which is what lets the designer read it back.
 *
 * ⚠️ That sentence was UNCONDITIONAL and, for one key, measurably false
 * (objectui#8896): it holds only where the draft ALSO carries the spec
 * spelling. A draft holding a relationship target ONLY as `referenceTo` had it
 * deleted here with nothing left behind. {@link stripRetiredFieldKeys} now
 * keeps that one value under `reference` before dropping the key, so the
 * sentence is true as written — see there for why the repair is keyed to this
 * key alone and is NOT a `specEquivalent` migration.
 *
 * ── The two registry keys this door deliberately does NOT strip ──
 *
 * `formula` — RULED, objectui#6526 option B (2026-08-27): this door reads
 * drafts a live editor also MIGRATES, which neither write-side carry-over
 * does. `ObjectFieldInspector` seeds its linting CEL editor from
 * `readPredicate(def.expression ?? def.formula)` and the first edit commits
 * the spec key and clears the alias (`patchDef({ expression: …, formula:
 * undefined })`) — the migration objectui#6043 preserved when it refused the
 * blind rename. Stripping here empties that editor and the authored source is
 * gone on the next save (measured on objectui#6519: with `formula` in this
 * list, the inspector's pin *commits edits to `expression` and migrates the
 * legacy `formula` key* goes RED with the editor rendering `""`). A `formula`
 * draft instead stays blocked at the server until the author makes that one
 * migrating edit, and the client-side 422 diagnostic names the field and
 * points at the Formula (CEL) editor (PR #6624).
 *
 * `sortOrder` — the premise fails: no writer on this tree ever populated a
 * field-level one (objectui#6045 — objectui#4687's zero-readers/zero-writers
 * shape, not a rename), so no draft this door reads can carry it, and a strip
 * would be dead code that reads like a measurement. This door's contract is
 * "add it on evidence, not defensively"; `MetadataService`'s carry-over keeps
 * it as that site's one recorded-DEFENSIVE entry instead. (The object-level
 * `sortOrder` on `ObjectDefinition` and the saved-view `sortOrder` in
 * `ObjectView` are different concepts living outside `fields` entirely, so
 * neither passes through this door.)
 *
 * Same shape as `PermissionAdvancedFacets`' `RETIRED_RLS_KEYS`
 * (objectstack#7130). Keyed to the tombstones, never a blanket unknown-key
 * purge: every other key the designer does not render still survives.
 * `object-fields-io.retiredKeys.test.ts` pins the derived list and both
 * absences from this door's side; the registry's own test pins the same facts
 * at the source.

 *
 * {@link RETIRED_FIELD_KEYS}' note said "Nothing is lost on the way out: where
 * the spec has a spelling for the concept it is a SEPARATE key (`reference`,
 * `system`) that is NOT stripped and rides through untouched". That holds only
 * when the draft ALSO carries the spec spelling. A draft holding the target
 * only as `referenceTo` had it deleted here with nothing left behind — and
 * this is the SINGLE read door for `draft.fields` across the whole object
 * designer, with `writeFields` writing each def back verbatim, so the loss
 * committed on the next save. `ObjectFieldInspector`'s target editor reads
 * `def.reference` and rendered empty; so did every other reader, because
 * objectui#6837's ruling ("protocol normalization belongs on the server, the
 * front end just executes the protocol") deleted the per-reader legacy arms.
 *
 * Recovering HERE is that ruling's own shape rather than an exception to it:
 * the door normalizes, the readers stay canonical. `reference_to` is the
 * ingestion choke points' business (`normalizeSchemaReferenceKeys`, which also
 * stamps a second key `FieldSchema` refuses) and is deliberately not touched by
 * this door, which serves a WRITE path.
 *
 * ## Three things this does not do
 *
 * ⛔ The retired key still never survives — `FieldSchema` refuses it by name,
 * which is the whole reason this door strips.
 * ⛔ Never overwrites a live `reference`: the spec spelling is what the author
 * has been editing, and a stale legacy value beside it is the older truth.
 * ⛔ Never invents a target. `unrecognized_keys` fires on the key's PRESENCE,
 * so `referenceTo: ''` is a real stored state; recovering it would hand every
 * gate downstream a target that names no object.
