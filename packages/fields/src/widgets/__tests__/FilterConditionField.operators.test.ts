 * naming the correct spelling (`$notContains`) in its error message. So every
 * "does not contain" rule authored here validated in the UI and was then
 * rejected downstream. Nothing caught it because the builder's operator list is

/**
 * Spec `$`-tokens no builder operator emits, each for a stated reason.
 *
 * Module scope, and the ONE list — the ratchet below reads this same Set rather
 * than restating its members. Two copies is how an exclusion outlives its
 * reason: removing `$icontains` from a hand-repeated ratchet list is a separate
 * edit nothing forces, so the ratchet would have gone on vouching for an entry
 * the parity assertion no longer holds (objectui#4023).
 *
 * `$eq` is the spec's IMPLICIT equality form — `equals` deliberately emits the
 * bare `{ field: value }` shape, never an explicit `$eq`. `$between` stays
 * covered by the `$gte`+`$lte` pair `between` emits (kvToCondition reads that
 * pair back as `between`).
 *
 * `$icontains` was here from objectui#3560 until objectui#4023: the spec gained
 * it between @objectstack/spec 17.0.0-rc.2 and rc.5, and no builder operator
 * could author it. `containsCaseInsensitive` now does, so the entry is gone and
 * the parity assertion below is what holds that honest.
 *
 * `$like` and `$ilike` arrived with the `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0 GA pin
 * (objectui#4636), and their entry here is a DECISION, not an open question:
 * objectui#4911, maintainer-ruled B on 2026-08-17 — this visual builder
 * deliberately does not offer raw pattern-matching authoring. The constrained
 * intents are the authorable surface and already reach the dropdown (`contains`
 * / `containsCaseInsensitive` / `startsWith` / `endsWith`), so what a `$like`
 * row would add on top of them is exactly the raw `%`/`_` wildcard form — the
 * one operator where a mis-authored value silently returns the wrong rows
 * instead of erroring, which is an error bed in an end-user filter UI, and for
 * zero measured author pull.
 *
 * This is a BUILDER-surface refusal, not a capability removal: the API surface
 * is unaffected and `FieldOperatorsSchema` goes on accepting both operators for
 * hand-written ObjectQL, direct JSON authors and integrations. That is what
 * makes the exclusion honest rather than a gap papered over — the tokens stay
 * reachable, just not from this dropdown.
 *
 * Reopen condition, named by the ruling: a real user or deployment asks to
 * author wildcard patterns in the UI. If that happens, reopen objectui#4911,
 * delete these two members and add the builder operators that author them; the
 * parity assertion below then holds that honest, exactly as it did when
 * objectui#4023 retired `$icontains`.
 *
 * Nothing mechanical can hold that condition for you — the ratchet below checks
 * only that a member is still a spec operator, never that its reason is still
 * the true one. A refusal that outlives its rationale is the stale-exclusion rot
 * this comment block warns about one level up, and a reader is what catches it,
 * not a run.
