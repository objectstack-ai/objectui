/**
 * The ONE place the spec's author-facing chart shape is translated into the
 * renderer's internal pipeline contract (framework#3729 / objectui#2880).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `ChartConfigSchema` (`@objectstack/spec/ui`) is the chart protocol — axes are
 * `{ field, format, min, max, logarithmic, … }` objects and series are
 * `{ name, stack, yAxis, … }`. The renderer, however, grew a Recharts-flavoured
 * internal shape: `chartType`, `xAxisKey` (a bare string) and
 * `series[].dataKey`. Everything an author wrote in the SPEC shape reached the
 * renderer and was silently dropped — precisely what ADR-0078 forbids.
 *
 * This module closes that gap by NORMALIZING at the boundary, rather than by
 * sprinkling `??` fallbacks through the render tree. That distinction matters
 * (framework PD #12): a lone normalization layer is a translation from one
 * declared contract to another, whereas scattered fallbacks fossilize a second
 * de-facto dialect at every read site.
 *
 * **Internal props win.** `DashboardRenderer`, `ObjectView` and the dataset
 * path already speak the internal shape; passing `xAxisKey`/`series[].dataKey`
 * explicitly keeps working byte-for-byte, so there is no migration.
 *
 * ## The `type` collision
 *
 * `ChartConfig.type` is the chart family (`'bar' | 'line' | …`). But on every
 * surface that FLATTENS chart config into a component props bag — the react
 * tier's injected blocks especially — `type` is already taken: it is the SDUI
 * envelope's component discriminator (`{ type: 'object-chart', … }`). An author
 * writing `type="bar"` would replace the discriminator and the block would not
 * resolve at all.
 *
 * The collision is created by the flattening, so it is resolved there: the
 * react-page wrapper preserves an author-supplied `type` under `specType`
 * before stamping the discriminator (see `react-page.tsx`). This module reads
 * it back. Surfaces where chart config is properly NESTED (a dashboard
 * widget's `chartConfig`) never collide and pass `type` through untouched.
 */

/**
 * A chart family this renderer actually draws.
 *
 * Every member is a `@objectstack/spec` `ChartTypeSchema` value except
 * **`combo`**, which is renderer-local and is NOT a spec chart type (#2945).
 * The spec models a combo chart per-series instead — `ChartSeries.type`, whose
 * field comment reads *"Series type override (combo charts)"* — exactly as it
 * models stacking with `ChartSeries.stack` rather than a `stacked-bar` family:
 *
 * > stacking is not a chart family, it is a property of the series … One `bar`
 * > family plus a series-level stack group expresses all three without
 * > multiplying the taxonomy.  — `spec/src/ui/chart.zod.ts`
 *
 * So `combo` is not a name an author should have to reach for. It is what "the
 * series disagree about their family" looks like from the renderer's side, and
 * {@link effectiveChartFamily} derives it. It stays in the union because
 * internal-shape callers pass it explicitly today (`DatasetPreview`) and
 * because dropping a name that is already authored breaks those charts.

/**
 * The component keywords this package registers for ONE named chart family,
 * mapped to the family each keyword names (objectui#7401).
 *
 * ## Why these are not just more members of {@link CHART_TYPES}
 *
 * `CHART_TYPES` answers "is this bare `type` a chart FAMILY" — `'pie'`,
 * `'scatter'`, the spec's own vocabulary. These are something else: they are
 * SDUI component discriminators, the keys `index.tsx` hands
 * `ComponentRegistry.register`. `type: 'pie-chart'` does not name a family in
 * any spec; it names a registration whose whole purpose is to draw one.
 *
 * ## Why the derivation exists at all (objectui#7401)
 *
 * Each of these registrations declared its family as
 * `defaultProps: { chartType: … }` — and **nothing on the SDUI path has ever
 * read a registration's `defaultProps`**. `SchemaRenderer` does not; the one
 * consumer in the tree, `WidgetRegistry.ts`, WRITES manifest defaults INTO the
 * registry rather than reading them back out. So `pie-chart`, `donut-chart`,
 * `radar-chart` and `scatter-chart` all arrived here with no family at all and
 * fell to `AdvancedChartImpl`'s `'bar'` default: valid data, a confidently
 * wrong picture, and no refusal that could fire. Ruled route C (director seat,
 * 2026-09-06, on maintainer authorisation): derive the family from the
 * schema's own `type`, and the inert `defaultProps` go with it — a second
 * declaration nothing reads is the `AGENTS.md` #0.1 hazard, and leaving it
 * beside a derivation that works would fossilize exactly the wrong convention.
 *
 * ## Why a table and not a `-chart` suffix rule
 *
 * A suffix rule accepts the whole cross product of {@link RENDERABLE} — it
 * would answer `'funnel'` for `type: 'funnel-chart'`, a keyword this package
 * does not register and the SDUI path therefore never resolves. That answer is
 * unreachable today and would silently become load-bearing the day someone
 * registers the keyword with a different family in mind. The table names
 * exactly the keywords that exist, and
 * `__tests__/chart-family-from-type-7401.test.tsx` pins it against the live
 * registry in both directions, so adding a registration without a family entry
 * (or an entry without a registration) is what goes red.
 *
 * ⛔ `bar-chart` is deliberately ABSENT: it is registered to
 * `ChartBarRenderer`, a different component that never calls this function.
 * An entry for it would be inert in precisely the way this card removed.

 *
 * ## Why `pickLocalized` and not a local pick (objectui#8943)
 *
 * The map arm used to return `Object.values(v).find(isString)` — **the first
 * string in key order**. That is not a resolution, it is a transcription of how
 * the author happened to type the object literal: a `zh` viewer got `定价` only
 * if `zh-CN` was written first, and reordering the JSON — no other change —
 * showed the same viewer English. Deterministic, silent, and wrong.
 *
 * `pickLocalized` (`@object-ui/i18n`) is this repository's ONE answer for the
 * spec's `I18nLabel` union: exact tag -> base language -> a region-qualified
 * sibling -> `default` -> `en` -> first value. It is pinned as the twin of the
 * backend's `resolveI18nLabel` (`@objectstack/spec`) in
 * `plugin-list/src/__tests__/i18nLabel-resolver-parity.test.ts`. The sibling
 * read site in this package — `ObjectChart`'s drill-drawer heading — already
 * routes through it, and this function is what put the CHART heading beside it
 * on a different answer for the same union on the same node.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not reintroduce a module-local pick here, and ⛔ do not "improve" this
 * by preferring `default`/`en` inline: a hand-rolled preference order is how
 * this class recurs, and a second answer disagrees with the published one on
 * the same value.
 *
 * ## The admission test is unchanged, deliberately
 *
 * Only what `I18nLabel` actually admits gets here — a plain string or an inline
 * locale map. `pickLocalized` alone would also stringify a number or a boolean
 * (`String(value)`), which would make this a wider authoring surface than the
 * contract declares; per AGENTS.md #0.1 that widening belongs in the spec if it
 * is wanted at all, not in a renderer-side coercion. So the guard below refuses
 * everything else exactly as before, and `pickLocalized` decides only WHICH
 * entry of an admitted value wins.
 *
 * `pickLocalized` spells a miss `''` (it feeds text nodes); every caller here
 * treats an empty label as absent, which is what `|| undefined` restores.

 * Merge one series entry from either shape.

 * Internal (`dataKey`) wins over spec (`name`) so a caller that already speaks

 *
 * ## `chartType` is the INTERNAL spelling, and only that (objectui#7744)
 *
 * The two spellings of the per-series family are NOT two authoring keys:
 *
 * - `type` is the AUTHORING face's key — spec `ChartSeries.type`, declared on
 *   the mirror as `ChartDataSeriesSchema.type` (`'bar' | 'line' | 'area'`).
 * - `chartType` is the RENDERER-INTERNAL carrier. It rides on the `dataKey`-
 *   shaped series that `DashboardRenderer`, `ObjectView` and the dataset path
 *   hand straight to `ChartRenderer`, which is where it is declared
 *   (`ChartRenderer.tsx:65`, on the internal series shape) and where
 *   {@link NormalizedSeries.chartType} is the output half of the same
 *   contract. On the AUTHORING face it is not a member at all: it is a named
 *   alias refusal — `ChartDataSeriesSchema.chartType`
 *   (`packages/types/src/zod/data-display.zod.ts`, objectui#7694 / PR #7737),
 *   pinned in that package's
 *   `__tests__/chart-series-chart-type-alias-refusal-7694.test.ts`. Read the
 *   rule and its remedy THERE. Restating either here would be a second copy of
 *   a rule that only one of the two files is ever edited with.
 *
 * ## The split this limb carries, deliberately (objectui#7744)
 *
 * This function normalizes BOTH shapes, and the `family` limb below cannot
 * tell them apart: by the time `raw` arrives it is a bag of keys with nothing
 * on it naming its producer. So an AUTHORED series that skipped validation
 * still gets `chartType` honoured at runtime — and honoured OVER the declared
 * `type`, which the limb reads second — while the validator refuses that same
 * key by name. The two faces disagree, and that is the state this comment
 * exists to make legible rather than to fix: the objectui#7744 ruling was to
 * annotate and pin, NOT to retire the limb at the reader, because retiring it
 * would change what the internal producers above render — a reader-side
 * decision of its own.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not delete the limb on the strength of a green ablation. Deleting
 * `str(raw.chartType) ??` left the repo fully green when it was measured
 * (304 files / 5817 tests) while deleting its ` ?? str(raw.type)` sibling went
 * 2 red — green there means only that no test PINNED it, never that no
 * producer depends on it. Both halves of the split, and the precedence between
 * them, are now pinned in `__tests__/chartType-internal-only-7744.test.ts`;
 * that case is what goes red if the two faces are ever brought into agreement,
 * from either side.
