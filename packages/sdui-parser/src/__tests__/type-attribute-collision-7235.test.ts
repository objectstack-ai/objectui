/**
 * html tier: an authored `type=` attribute collides with the envelope's own
 * discriminator, and is REFUSED at parse time (objectui#7235 — the port of
 * objectstack#13957, maintainer ruling 2026-09-01, ADR-0080 amendment).
 *
 * The two outcomes this replaces are pinned side by side on purpose, because
 * they are the reason the refusal is at parse rather than at the warning layer:
 * one of them produced NO diagnostic at all, and the other produced a loud one
 * pointing somewhere else. A test that only asserted "an error is raised" would
 * pass on the second case before this change.
 *
 * ⚠️ This copy is the RENDERER's (and the console's live edit preview); the
 * save gate runs objectstack's. Until this landed the two differed in accepted
 * grammar, so an author got no diagnostic while typing and a refusal on save.
