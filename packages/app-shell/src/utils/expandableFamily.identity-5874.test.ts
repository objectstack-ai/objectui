/**
 * objectui#5874 — `resolveActionParams`' private copy of the reference-bearing
 * field family converges onto `@object-ui/core`'s `EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES`.
 *
 * The copy was `resolvedType === 'lookup' || resolvedType === 'reference'`,
 * the test gating `lookupExtras` — the picker config (`referenceTo`,
 * `displayField`, `idField`, …) this resolver copies off the underlying object
 * field and `paramToField()` then forwards to `<LookupField>`. Neither derived
 * from nor pinned against the shared set.
 *
 * ## Why the load-bearing pin is IDENTITY, not membership
 *
 * Every membership assertion below is satisfied by a private
 * `new Set(['lookup', 'master_detail', 'tree', 'user'])` holding the same
 * strings — i.e. by a re-fork of exactly the kind this change removed. So the
 * pin that decides the convergence spies on the `has` of the object core
 * exports: a call is recorded only if the face under test consulted THAT
 * object, so a member-identical private copy leaves the spy empty and fails
 * here, where a value check would pass ON the defect. Same shape as
 * objectui#4770 / #4790 / #4815 / #5312 / #5692.
 *
 * ## This face's membership delta is THREE members, not two
 *
 * Unlike its three sibling faces in objectui#5874 it also lacked
 * `master_detail`, so a field-backed `master_detail` param inherited no picker
 * config at all and `paramToField()` then degraded it to a plain record-id text
 * input — the unexplained "paste a UUID" box objectui#3405 exists to prevent.
 *
 * `reference` is the one member that does NOT drop on this face, and that is a
 * measurement rather than an omission: it is undeclarable (refused by the
 * spec's `ActionParamSchema`, pinned below with live and dead controls), but
 * the dialog still ACCEPTS it from params already authored with it, via
 * `PARAM_TYPE_ALIASES` in `paramToField.ts`, which folds it to `lookup`. The
 * convergence therefore asks the shared set over the widget key
 * `resolveParamWidgetType()` produces — one alias table, read not copied, and
 * the SAME expression `paramToField()` evaluates one step later.
 *
 * Ablation direction, predicted before running: restore the private copy
 * (`resolvedType === 'lookup' || resolvedType === 'reference'`) and the
 * identity pin goes RED (the spy records no call) while a member-set assertion
 * over `EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES` stays GREEN — that contrast is the whole
 * reason the pin is on identity. The restoration probes go red too; the
 * ordinary-relation control stays green in both directions, which is what
 * makes it a control rather than a duplicate of the pins.

 * raising and this read is module-scope. What it replaces was a NON-OPTIONAL
 * cast of the enum node to an options-bearing shape, spread directly — which
 * failed LOUDLY the moment the cast stopped holding (spreading `undefined`
 * throws), so a bare `enumOptions` call here would have traded a loud failure
 * for a silently empty vocabulary: every assertion below would then pass over
 * nothing. That trade is the regression objectui#7025 exists to refuse. (The

 *
 * ⭐ `dependsOn` is the exception and must stay camel (objectui#8672, ruling A).
 * It was `depends_on: ['region']` and passed only because the resolver read the

 * NAME. Ruling A moved that read onto the declared `dependsOn` and removed the
 * snake leg, so the old fixture row silently produced nothing and the
