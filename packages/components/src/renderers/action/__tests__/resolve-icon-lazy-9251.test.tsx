 * objectui#9251 — the `icons` record is off the eager path, and what that cost.
 *
 * The ruling (decision batch #132 item 4, maintainer 「同意」, 2026-09-13) moved
 * the seam's glyph loading onto lucide's dynamic-import map and its membership
 * question onto a build-generated static list. Two things therefore have to be
 * pinned, and they pull in opposite directions:
 *
 *   1. The BYTES actually leave — nothing on the seam's import graph reaches
 *      lucide's runtime `icons` record any more. That half is mechanical, in
 *      `scripts/check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs` part 4, and re-asserted from
 *      the test side in `lucide-record-icon-names-generated-9251.test.ts`.
 *   2. What renders does NOT change, apart from when the path data arrives.
 *      That is this file.
 *
 * ⚠️ The second is the one a reader will doubt, because "lazy" usually means
 * "renders nothing for a frame". It does not here: which icon a name resolves
 * to is known synchronously from the generated list, so the `<svg>` — its
 * classes, its box, its attributes — is emitted on the first frame and only the
 * `<path>` children arrive late. The rows below assert both halves of that
 * against lucide's OWN component as the oracle, never against a copy of what
 * this repo happens to emit.
