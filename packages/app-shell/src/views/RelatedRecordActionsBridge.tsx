/**
 * RelatedRecordActionsBridge — supplies the console's object-aware CRUD +
 * action handlers to the `record:related_list` renderers on a detail page.
 *
 * The renderer (in `@object-ui/plugin-detail`) knows the child object, the FK
 * back to the parent, and the parent id — but not the SPA routes, the
 * create/edit form pages, or the per-object lifecycle affordances. This bridge
 * (mounted inside the page's `ActionProvider`) closes that gap:
 *
 *   - 查看详情 → navigate to the child record's detail route
 *   - 增 / 改   → open the child form as an OVERLAY on the parent detail
 *                 (#2604 D3: a child task's return target is ALWAYS the parent
 *                 detail with the subtable refreshed — never a route, which
 *                 would drop the parent's scroll/tab context and refetch it).
 *                 Implemented by pushing the console's record-form URL params
 *                 (`?form=…&formObject=…&formLink=…`) — the ONE global record
 *                 form overlay in `AppContent` picks them up, pre-links the
 *                 parent from `formLink`, sizes to the CHILD object, and on
 *                 save stays put + refetches the child's related lists
 *                 (`notifyRelatedChanged`). URL-driven means browser Back
 *                 closes the overlay and a refresh reopens it STILL correctly
 *                 parent-linked.
 *   - 删        → `dataSource.delete(child, id)` (RelatedList shows the confirm
 *                 dialog and refreshes afterwards)
 *   - 子对象 action → the child object's `list_item` actions, executed against
 *                 the clicked row through the page's shared ActionRunner
 *
 * Each affordance is gated by {@link resolveEffectiveCrudAffordances} so system /
 * append-only children never show New / Edit / Delete. When this bridge is
 * absent (e.g. the Studio designer) the related list stays read-only.
 *
 * ## The related-list toolbar's create predicates (objectui#4646)
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec@17.0.0` widened `userActions.create` from a bare boolean
 * to `z.union([z.boolean(), RowCrudActionOverrideSchema])`, so
 * `resolveCrudAffordances` now emits `createPredicates` beside the
 * `editPredicates` / `deletePredicates` the row surfaces have consumed since
 * objectui#2614. Nothing read them: the spec's CHANGELOG named "the
 * related-list toolbar honouring `create.visibleWhen`" as objectui's downstream
 * card, and this is that card. A parent record entering a frozen state greyed
 * its children's row Edit/Delete correctly while "+ New" stayed live, so the
 * user filled in the whole child form to earn a 409.
 *
 * The binding is the spec docblock's, not an invention here: unlike the ROW
 * predicates, `createPredicates` evaluates **once per toolbar, against the
 * record of the scope the toolbar sits in** — on a record page's related list
 * that is the HOST PARENT record, which is why `parentRecord` had to be
 * threaded in beside the `parentRecordId` this bridge already carried. (An id
 * cannot answer `record.status != 'frozen'`.) A standalone object list has no
 * record in scope and evaluates nothing — it never reaches this bridge at all.
 *
 * Evaluated WITHOUT a hook, deliberately: `resolve` answers for a VARIABLE
 * number of related lists inside one `useMemo`, so a `useRowPredicate` per
 * child object would tie the hook count to the page's related-list count. This
 * is the same constraint — and the same resolution — as `plugin-grid`'s
 * `evalRowActionVisibility`, whose row loop faces it per action. The evaluator
 * underneath is the canonical one either way (`evalRowPredicate`), and the fail
 * directions below are the record header's verbatim.
