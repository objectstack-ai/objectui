/**
 * objectui#10866 — `ObjectTimeline` buckets, orders and dates a stored
 * date-only day as that day, in every zone.
 *
 * ── What was measured ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three reads of the record's start value, across two files, used the
 * engine's own `Date` parse, which reads a date-only `2026-10-06` as UTC
 * midnight:
 *
 *  - the date bucket (`startOfDay(new Date(raw))`), so west of UTC an item
 *    due today sat under "Overdue" and one due tomorrow under "Today";
 *  - the sort (`new Date(a.startDate).getTime()`), which placed a date-only
 *    day at UTC midnight among instants;
 *  - the renderer's item date (`formatDate`), whose default `short` face read
 *    `10/5/2026` for it.
 *
 * All three now take the shared step, `toDisplayDate` (`@object-ui/core`, the
 * objectui#10183 convention), which tells the two shapes apart by the value:
 * a date-only string is local midnight of the day it names, and a value with
 * a time part keeps its instant. The sort case holds one of each, because
 * only a mix can show the sort and the buckets disagreeing: the vertical
 * renderer groups ADJACENT items, so an order that disagrees with the buckets
 * reads as "Today" above "Earlier" (the past-day bucket, objectui#11676).
 *
 * ── ⚠️ The zone cases run ONLY when driven, in a FORKS child ────────────────
 * `process.env.TZ` written inside a test of the normal run does not move the
 * zone (the root config runs `pool: 'threads'`), so the zone cases are
 * skipped there and `scripts/__tests__/date-only-zone-pins-10183.test.ts`
 * runs them on the forks pool and fails unless every one ran and passed. Each
 * zone opens with a rig case, so a child whose zone did not move reds instead
 * of going quietly green. The suite-zone cases run in the normal run too; they
 * cannot tell the repair from its absence, because UTC is the one offset where
 * the two parses agree.
 *
 * `Asia/Shanghai` is the control: east of UTC the UTC-midnight parse already
 * landed on the named day, and an hour-offset "repair" would break it.
