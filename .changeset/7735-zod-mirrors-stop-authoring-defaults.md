The zod mirrors stop authoring defaults; the renderer's fallback is the one
authoritative default (objectui#7735, director ruling, decision batch #69,
2026-09-07 — maintainer reply 「其他同意」).

**A validator validates; it does not write values into an author's document.**
`.default(v)` on a mirror member is not documentation — `parse` SUBSTITUTES `v`
into the output when the key is absent. One authored document therefore had two
shapes depending on whether it had been through `safeValidateSchema`, and where
the mirror and the renderer disagreed the mirror silently won:

| key | mirror wrote | the renderer applies |
|---|---|---|
| `ContainerSchema.maxWidth` | `'lg'` | `container.tsx`: `?? 'xl'` |
| `FlexSchema.align` | `'center'` | `flex.tsx`: `\|\| 'start'` |

A `container` omitting `maxWidth` rendered `max-w-xl` as authored and `max-w-lg`
after a round-trip through the mirror; `'center'` is a value neither `flex` nor
`stack` applies at all. `StackSchema` already declared no defaults, so the file
was not even self-consistent.

**What changed.** All 41 `.default()` call sites under `packages/types/src/zod/`
are removed — `layout.zod.ts` 22, `crud.zod.ts` 11, `form.zod.ts` 5,
`views.zod.ts` 2, `app.zod.ts` 1. `@object-ui/components` reconciles the third
face a separate finding found: `flex`'s registration `defaultProps.align` seeded
`'center'`, the value its own renderer never applies, so a designer-made node
laid out differently from a hand-authored one; it now seeds `'start'`.

**Accept set unchanged.** Every one of the 41 was spelled
`<type>.optional().default(v)`, so none was carrying optionality: nothing that
parsed before is refused now, and nothing refused before is accepted. This is a
narrowing of `parse` OUTPUT only.

**⚠️ Breaking for consumers that read `result.data`.** `validateSchema` /
`safeValidateSchema` no longer substitute: for a document that OMITS one of these
keys the key is now ABSENT from the parsed output instead of carrying a value the
document never authored. Every one of the 41 keys changes output this way. If you
read a default off the parsed document rather than applying your own fallback,
apply the fallback yourself.

**And rendering changes too, wherever the mirror's value differed from the
renderer's.** An earlier draft of this note said rendering does not change on the
ground that "the two keys that disagreed were the bug"; that was the triage
sample of 7 keys, not a measurement of the population. Auditing all 22 layout
keys against their renderers finds **six** disagreements, not two:

| key | the mirror wrote | what the renderer applies when the key is absent |
|---|---|---|
| `container.maxWidth` | `'lg'` | `container.tsx`: `?? 'xl'` |
| `flex.align` | `'center'` | `flex.tsx`: `\|\| 'start'` |
| `grid.columns` | `3` | `grid.tsx`: `let baseCols = 2` |
| `text.variant` | `'body'` | `text.tsx`: none — a bare node, no typography class (`57f9b077b`) |
| `resizable.withHandle` | `true` | forwarded bare; `undefined` draws NO grip |
| `page.template` | `'default'` | `page.tsx`: a null template falls through to the `pageType` dispatch |

So a consumer that renders `result.data` sees a different result on all six. What
does NOT change is rendering inside this repository: the render path never ran
this validator at all — `SchemaRenderer` calls the STRUCTURAL `validateSchema`
from `@object-ui/core`, which returns `{valid, errors}` and hands the renderer
the author's own object. The four modules that do import `@object-ui/types/zod`
were censused: two read only `result.success`, one discards `result.data`, and
`os validate` reads only `type` / `id` / `label` / `title` / `children`, none of
which ever carried a default. The four JSDoc `@default` tags that described the
mirror rather than the renderer (`grid.columns`, `text.variant`,
`resizable.withHandle`, `page.template`) are corrected in the same change.

Note that `safeValidateSchema` still substitutes through subschemas imported by
reference from `@objectstack/spec` (`app.active`, `object-view.navigation.*`,
`list-view.sharing.type`, and others). Those values are written in that package,
not this one, and are unaffected by this change.
