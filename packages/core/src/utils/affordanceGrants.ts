/**
 * The affordance-to-grant map (objectui#12082): ONE table naming, for every
 * console affordance that offers a write, the grant the caller must hold for
 * it — and ONE resolver every such affordance reads.
 *
 * ## The family this closes
 *
 * Each console surface used to decide on its own which grant its affordance
 * reads, and each surface that decided wrongly was found and fixed alone
 * (objectui#4296, #10107, #11000, #12047). objectui#12082 is the member that
 * hurt most: a create form gated its fields on the EDIT grant, so a
 * create-only role could not fill the form it was allowed to submit. The same
 * pass found the record header not reading the update grant at all, and a
 * lookup offering "Create new" with no grant read either (objectui#12081). The
 * cause is one shape — an affordance spelling its own permission logic — so
 * the fix is one table every affordance reads, not another one-off repair.
 *
 * ## What a row says
 *
 * `crud` — the resolved CRUD-affordance bit the affordance also needs: the
 * object's managed-object policy (ADR-0103, the spec's
 * `resolveCrudAffordances`) intersected with the server's effective API
 * operation set (`/me/permissions` `apiOperations`, objectstack#3391), both
 * through {@link resolveEffectiveCrudAffordances}. `null` for an affordance
 * whose write does not go through the object's generic data door (an
 * attachment upload goes through the storage route; the import template has
 * its own endpoint), so that door's operation set says nothing about it.
 *
 * `grant` — the caller's object grant it exercises, asked as `can(object,
 * grant)` (`MePermissionsProvider` maps `create` → `allowCreate`, `update` →
 * `allowEdit`, `delete` → `allowDelete`).
 *
 * `field` — for an affordance that offers FIELDS to write, the field-level
 * question asked of each one: `create` for an insert, `write` for an update.
 * They differ only for a field the permission set does not mention, which the
 * server's field step lets through so that object admission decides: on an
 * insert that is `allowCreate`, on an update `allowEdit`. A field the set marks
 * `editable: false` is refused on both, and the resolver answers that the same
 * way for both questions. So a create form follows what the server enforces on
 * insert, and adds no rule the server does not have.
 *
 * ## The verdict
 *
 * An affordance shows when the managed-object policy, the effective API
 * operation set AND the caller's grant all allow it ({@link resolveAffordance}).
 * Its `userActions` predicates (the #2614 object form) are surfaced only then:
 * a predicate narrows, and never re-opens what policy, operation set or grant
 * closed.
 *
 * ## Fail-open, as before
 *
 * With no permission provider mounted, `usePermissions()` answers `can` with
 * `true` and `isLoaded` with `false`, so every grant here reads open and the
 * field question is not asked at all — a standalone embed, a designer preview
 * and a public surface behave as they did before permissions existed, and the
 * server still enforces (the `fieldWriteGate.ts` contract in
 * `@object-ui/plugin-form`). The policy half is not a per-principal answer and
 * does not fail open with it, exactly as `resolveEffectiveCrudAffordances`
 * never did.
 *
 * ## Adding an affordance
 *
 * Add its row here and read it through {@link resolveAffordance} (or
 * {@link resolveFieldAffordance} for fields). The enumeration pin in
 * `@object-ui/plugin-form` (`affordanceGrantMap-12082.test.tsx`) runs every row
 * against four grant shapes and holds the row set to its own expectation table,
 * and its census refuses a console source file that reads a CRUD grant without
 * this map.
