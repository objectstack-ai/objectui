/**
 * Tiny predicate evaluator for FormView `visibleOn` expressions.
 *
 * This is an interim stand-in for the full CEL runtime
 * (`@objectstack/formula`) — we keep it intentionally small so the
 * Setup admin engine has zero new runtime dependencies. When CEL is
 * unified across the platform (ROADMAP M9), swap `evaluatePredicate`
 * for the real CEL evaluator without touching SchemaForm.tsx.
 *
 * Supported subset (covers everything used in spec `*.form.ts` today):
 *   - `path == 'literal'`       string equality
 *   - `path != 'literal'`       string inequality
 *   - `path == 123`             number equality
 *   - `path == true|false`      boolean equality
 *   - `path in ['a','b']`       membership
 *   - `!path`                   negation (truthy)
 *   - `path`                    truthy check
 *   - `path && expr`            conjunction
 *   - `path || expr`            disjunction
 *
 * Paths support dot notation: `data.type`, `data.config.kind`.
 *
 * On any parse error → returns `true` (fail-open): better to show a
 * field than to silently hide it.
 *
 * ## Unresolvable identifiers also fail OPEN (objectstack#6936)
 *
 * The fail-open promise above used to cover only *thrown* errors. A path whose
 * ROOT identifier does not exist in the evaluation scope took a different route:
 * `resolveValue` returned `undefined`, and then every comparison quietly judged
 * it false — `['text','number'].includes(undefined)`, `undefined === 'text'` —
 * so a predicate referencing a name that isn't there HID the field. Fail-CLOSED,
 * the exact opposite of what this header promised, and undiagnosable: the
 * symptom is "the config item is gone", with nothing in the console.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. `@objectstack/spec` ≤ 17.0.0-rc.5 spells the
 * `objectForm` sub-field predicates bare (`type in ['text',…]`) while this
 * engine evaluates them against a `{ data: draftRow }` scope, so a frontend
 * upgraded ahead of its backend resolved `type` to nothing and 16 type-
 * conditional Studio sub-fields (Min / Max / Precision / Scale / Max Length /
 * Min Length / reference / deleteBehavior / expression / returnType /
 * autonumberFormat / language …) vanished at once. objectstack#6254 re-spells
 * them `data.type`; this evaluator must not turn the version-skew window into
 * silent feature loss.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling on objectstack#6936 (option C): an unresolvable path makes
 * the predicate evaluate `true`, and dev mode says so, naming the path and the
 * predicate that carried it.
 *
 * ### The boundary this draws — read before widening it
 *
 * "Unresolvable" means **the path's root identifier is not a name this scope
 * declares** (`type`, `record.status`, `page.selectedId` against a scope that
 * declares `data` plus the identity roots of {@link IDENTITY_ROOTS}). It does
 * NOT mean "the value came out undefined":
 *
 *   - `data.type == 'text'` on a draft that has no `type` yet → the root `data`
 *     resolves, the draft simply has no value there. That is a legitimate
 *     `undefined` VALUE, it compares false, and the field stays hidden. A draft
 *     is allowed to be empty; treating an unfilled field as "unresolvable"
 *     would show every type-conditional sub-field at once on a fresh row.
 *   - `data.tpye == 'text'` — a typo one segment deep — is indistinguishable
 *     from the above WITHOUT the schema, which this evaluator does not have.
 *     Catching that is the producer's job (publish-time validation of predicate
 *     path references, filed separately), not something the renderer may guess
 *     at. Commandment #0.1: one strict contract at the producer beats a
 *     renderer heuristic.
 *
 * The signal is a thrown {@link UnresolvedPathError}, deliberately not a
 * sentinel value: fail-open is a property of the WHOLE predicate, not of the
 * sub-expression that failed. A sentinel would have to be threaded through
 * `!`, `&&`, `||`, `in` and `==` by hand, and the first spot that missed it
 * would invert the verdict — `!unresolvedPath` would evaluate the inner path to
 * "true-ish" and then negate it back to false, i.e. fail-CLOSED again, which is
 * the bug. Throwing routes every failure to the one fail-open gate that already
 * exists.
 *
 * Two consequences of evaluating in CEL order, both pinned in `predicate.test.ts`:
 * `false && <unresolvable>` is `false` and `true || <unresolvable>` is `true` —
 * the unresolvable half is short-circuited away, absorbed exactly as CEL absorbs
 * an erroring branch, and no warning fires because nothing needed it.
 *
 * ## A path on the RIGHT of `==` / `!=` is a string literal (objectui#4049)
 *
 * Only the LEFT side resolves. The right side goes to `parseLiteral`, whose tail
 * hands back anything it does not recognise as a literal VERBATIM — so
 * `data.a == data.b` compares the value of `data.a` against the seven-character
 * string "data.b". It is FALSE however equal the two sides are, and
 * `data.a != data.b` is correspondingly TRUE. The subset list above is honest
 * about this (`path == 'literal'`, never `path == path`), but the boundary was
 * enforced by silence: objectstack#6936's warning cannot reach it, because that
 * one hangs on `resolveValue` and the right side never enters it.
 *
 * Ruling on objectui#4049: **option B only — a dev-mode diagnostic here, zero
 * semantic change.** Resolving the right side (option A) was rejected: it would
 * flip `data.type == text`, the unquoted-string spelling that works today by
 * accident, into a fail-open `true`. The verdicts stay bit-for-bit what they
 * were and are pinned that way in `predicate.test.ts` §7.3; all that changes is
 * that the console stops being silent about the subset boundary.
 *
 * The semantic fix belongs to the producer — publish-time validation of
 * predicate expressions (objectstack#7010) — and to the real CEL runtime: as the
 * header says, this file is an interim stand-in for `@objectstack/formula`, so
 * **this diagnostic retires with the file** when ROADMAP M9 lands CEL. Do not
 * grow it into a second evaluator.
 *
 * ## An unparseable element inside `in [...]` also fails silently (objectui#4266)
 *
 * `path in [...]` hands the bracketed text to `parseLiteral`'s array branch,
 * which JSON-parses it after normalising quotes. An element that is not a JSON
 * literal — a path, a bare identifier, a trailing comma — makes that
 * `JSON.parse` throw, and the `catch` returned `[]` with nothing in the
 * console. `[].includes(anything)` is `false`, so the predicate silently reads
 * FALSE FOR EVERY ROW, and — because the parse is whole-set, not per-element —
 * one bad element discards every good literal sitting next to it too:
 * `data.type in ['text', data.a]` collapsed exactly as hard as `data.type in
 * [data.a]` alone.
 *
 * Same family as objectui#4049 (silently wrong verdict, zero warning) and the
 * same ruling: **diagnose only, zero semantic change.** The `catch` still
 * returns `[]` — an `in` set that fails to parse is still, and remains, the
 * empty set — this file does not gain the ability to resolve a path inside
 * `in [...]` (that stays outside the declared subset; #4049 already draws
 * that boundary for the right side of `==`/`!=` and it is not reopened here).
 * All that changes is that the console names the predicate and, best-effort,
 * the element that broke the parse, instead of staying silent. Verdicts are
 * pinned identical before and after in `predicate.test.ts` §8.3, the same
 * shape as #4049's §7.3.
 *
 * A louder option — making the whole predicate throw so the top-level
 * fail-open in {@link evaluatePredicate} turns it `true`, mirroring
 * objectstack#6936's unresolved-path ruling — was considered and rejected:
 * #6936's `true` verdict corrects a fail-CLOSED bug (a hidden field is worse
 * than a shown one), but here the existing verdict (`false`, i.e. hidden) is
 * not a bug — it is the documented behaviour for a set this evaluator cannot
 * parse, same as `#4049`'s tail returning the right-hand text verbatim
 * instead of resolving it. Flipping it to fail-open `true` would be a
 * semantic change with no ruling behind it, and would make an authoring
 * mistake (a stray non-literal element) MORE visible than a correctly
 * authored predicate that legitimately evaluates false — exactly backwards.
 *
 * This diagnostic retires with the file at ROADMAP M9, same as #4049's.
 *
 * ## `in` with a PATH on the right never reaches the `in` branch (objectui#6617)
 *
 * The `in` branch matches `/^(.+?)\s+in\s+(\[.*\])$/` — the right side must be a
 * BRACKETED literal set. A membership test whose right side is a PATH therefore
 * does not match that branch at all. It carries no `==`/`!=` either, so it falls
 * all the way to the bare-truthy tail and the WHOLE text is handed to
 * `resolveValue` as one operand:
 *
 *   - `'admin' in current_user.positions` — ADR-0068's own headline example, and
 *     the spelling `SelectOptionSchema`'s docblock names as the canonical use of
 *     the key — leads with a quote, so `resolveValue`'s literal shortcut hands it
 *     to `parseLiteral`, whose quoted-string branch declines it (it starts with a
 *     quote but does not END with one) and whose tail returns it VERBATIM. A
 *     non-empty string is truthy ⇒ the predicate is TRUE for every user, whatever
 *     `positions` holds. Fail-OPEN: an option, field or section gated to admins
 *     renders for everyone.
 *   - `data.roles in current_user.positions` — path-shaped, so `resolveValue`
 *     splits it on dots into `data` / `roles in current_user` / `positions`, walks
 *     off the draft at the second segment and returns `undefined` ⇒ FALSE for
 *     every row instead.
 *
 * Either way the verdict has nothing to do with the membership that was written,
 * and — this is the part this section closes — it was SILENT. objectstack#6936's
 * warning cannot see the first shape (the root is never resolved at all: the text
 * begins with a quote, so it never enters `resolveValue`'s path branch) and
 * objectui#4049's `PATH_SHAPED_LITERAL` cannot either (it only matches text
 * starting with an identifier character, and this text starts with a quote).
 * Binding or not binding `current_user` cannot change any of it — the gap is a
 * property of the operator's GRAMMAR, not of which names the scope declares, so
 * it is not a regression from objectui#6247 and is measured identical before and
 * after it.
 *
 * Ruling on objectui#6617: **diagnose only, zero semantic change** — the third
 * time this file takes the posture #4049 and #4266 took, and for the third time
 * the reason is the same: the verdict is not corrected here, only the silence is.
 * The hook sits at the bare-truthy tail, AFTER the `in` branch has already
 * declined the text, and asks one question — does this text nonetheless carry a
 * top-level `in`? Nothing is resolved that was not resolved before, no operand
 * handling is added, and no expression that evaluates today reaches a different
 * answer (pinned in `predicate.test.ts` §9.3, the same shape as §7.3 and §8.3).
 * Resolving the right side of `in` is the widening the header's standing
 * constraint names — this file is an interim stand-in for `@objectstack/formula`
 * and retires at ROADMAP M9; do not grow it into a second evaluator — so it is
 * NOT done here, and the diagnostic says so plainly rather than implying that
 * some other punctuation would work.
 *
 * ### Why the detection must be quote-aware, and why it reuses `splitTopLevel`
 *
 * ⚠️ A naive `expr.includes(' in ')` is WRONG. A predicate that is itself a bare
 * quoted literal containing the word — `'plug in adapter'` — is CORRECT code
 * (a non-empty string literal, truthy), and announcing it as a broken membership
 * test would be a false statement about the author's code: the exact failure the
 * `PATH_SHAPED_LITERAL` note refuses to commit. So the scan is `splitTopLevel`'s
 * existing `inStr`/`depth` walk, REUSED rather than rewritten — the same walk the
 * `&&`/`||` splitters and `findUnparseableSetElement` already trust — with `' in '`
 * as the operator. Inside a quoted run it never even tests the operator, so a
 * quoted literal cannot false-positive, and that reuse is also what keeps this a
 * DETECTION rather than a second parser.
 *
 * The argument that there is no other false positive is short: an expression that
 * reaches the bare-truthy tail and is CORRECT is either a path (no spaces are
 * possible in one) or a literal — and the only literal that can contain `' in '`
 * is a quoted string, which the `inStr` walk protects. So every remaining hit is
 * either a membership test this evaluator cannot run, or text that is not a valid
 * predicate at all.
 *
 * Two spellings are deliberately NOT detected, and both fail to SILENCE (the
 * status quo) rather than to a false claim: a tab-separated `in`, and a
 * parenthesised `('admin' in current_user.positions)` where the operator sits at
 * `depth > 0`. Widening the walk to reach them would mean teaching it about
 * whitespace classes and parentheses the evaluator itself does not support —
 * growing the parser to improve a warning, which is the trade this file does not
 * make.
 *
 * This diagnostic retires with the file at ROADMAP M9, same as #4049's and
 * #4266's.
