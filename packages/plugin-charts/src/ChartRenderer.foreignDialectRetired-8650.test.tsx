 * objectui#8650 — the "Tremor/simple format" adapter inside `ChartRenderer` is
 * retired, and the four keys it read do NOT share one verdict.
 *
 * ## What was measured, and why the four split
 *
 * The card filed this as one group of four undeclared reads. A cast-aware read
 * census (`schemaReads`, objectui#6576) plus a TypeScript-checker declaredness
 * reading (`getPropertyOfType`, never a grep — objectui#8410) measured them
 * apart:
 *
 *   - `categories` is a DECLARED member of the published `ChartSchema` and of
 *     its zod mirror, is documented in the schema reference as an alternative
 *     series list, and was ruled LIVE by objectui#6896. It was never a foreign
 *     spelling. `normalizeChartSchema` — the ONE translation point
 *     (objectui#2880 S1) — already consumed it, so `ChartRenderer`'s own branch
 *     was a SECOND, un-normalized read of a key the normalizer owns and could
 *     not be reached by any well-formed chart. ⇒ the branch goes, the
 *     capability stays. The cases below pin that it still plots.
 *   - `index`, `category` and `value` are declared on NO published face, are
 *     advertised by no registry `inputs`, are taught by no doc or skill, and a
 *     structural producer census over this repo found ZERO nodes writing them.
 *     ⇒ retired, per AGENTS.md #0.1 (the remedy belongs at the producer, and
 *     there is no producer).
 *
 * ## The failure mode the retirement degrades to — measured, not assumed
 *
 * ⚠️ It is CONDITIONAL on the rows, and an earlier reading of it here was too
 * strong. With no `xAxisKey` bound, `AdvancedChartImpl` falls back to its
 * default category key `name`: rows carrying no `name` column — `DATA` below
 * — hit its on-screen `missing-category-key` refusal (objectui#8168's family),
 * but rows that DO carry one plot SILENTLY against `name`. The cases below pin
 * the refusing half, and read the refusal by its `data-chart-error` CODE — the
 * machine-readable half that sibling suites already pin — never by its wording,
 * which no consumer parses.
 *
 * ⛔ The negative form these cases used to take — sleep a fixed window, then
 * assert no plot surface YET — is gone and must not come back. It was a race in
 * the FALSE-GREEN direction: warm time-to-surface for the canonical control was
 * measured at 97–168 ms (cold 578 ms) against a 150 ms window, so on a loaded
 * runner a re-added alias that plotted LATE would satisfy it — a pin that
 * cannot fail. A `waitFor` on the POSITIVE signal fails the other way: a slow
 * runner makes it slower, never green.
 *
 * ⭐ Every refusal below is read against the CANONICAL control in the same
 * file: the same data and the same chart, written with `xAxisKey` / `series`,
 * must plot. Without it a renderer that had stopped drawing anything at all
 * would satisfy every negative case here.
