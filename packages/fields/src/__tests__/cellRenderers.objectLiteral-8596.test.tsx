 * objectui#8596 — an object literal is not a cell value, and six renderer
 * families invented an IDENTITY for it.
 *
 * The `[]` column of this census is closed (objectui#8481 → objectui#8490 →
 * objectui#8580). This is the `{}` column. It was measured the same way, and
 * only that way: all 53 registered field types rendered through
 * `getCellRenderer` against `[]`, `{}`, `''` and `null` — 212 cells — on
 * `4eb665bcf`, then re-rendered after the fix and diffed. A regex over class
 * strings under-counted this class three separate times; the instrument is
 * below, as `THE CENSUS`, so it stays runnable.
 *
 * Measured before → after, `{}` column only (14 of 212 cells moved; the `[]`,
 * `''` and `null` columns are byte-identical):
 *
 * | field types                                        | renderer                  | `{}` before                                    | `{}` after                     |
 * |----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
 * | email, url, phone                                  | Email/Url/PhoneCell       | a LIVE anchor — `mailto:[Object]`, `[Object]`, `tel:[Object]` — plus a copy button | `[Object]`, as `text` prints it |
 * | color                                              | `ColorSwatchCellRenderer` | a swatch whose `background` was `[object Object]` | `[Object]`, as `text` prints it |
 * | select, status, multiselect, radio, checkboxes, tags | `SelectCellRenderer`      | a badge reading `[Object Object]`               | a badge reading `[Object]`     |
 * | user                                               | `UserCellRenderer`        | an avatar captioned `U`, labelled `User`        | `[Object]`, as `lookup` prints it |
 * | file, video, audio                                 | `FileCellRenderer`        | a chip named `File`                             | the shared `EmptyValue`        |
 *
 * ── Two rows the card named that are NOT here, both verified ──────────────
 *   - `boolean` / `toggle` LANDED (objectui#8582 / PR #8594, `70c452369`).
 *     Measured on this base, `{}` already draws the shared affordance. Not
 *     re-ruled, and pinned unchanged in `THE CENSUS` below.
 *   - `location` / `geolocation` (and `json` / `object` / `composite` /
 *     `record`) print the `{}` literal behind objectui#8481's DECLARED
 *     json-literal fence. Left alone deliberately; pinned unchanged.
 *   - `date` drew `formatDate`'s hand-rolled em-dash with no accessible name
 *     — objectui#8581's subject, the same renderer. This change did not touch
 *     it, and `THE CENSUS` pinned that it did not: the row was recorded as a
 *     dash that is NOT the affordance, so a fix landing on it here would have
 *     to move a pin rather than pass silently. It did: objectui#8581 landed,
 *     `DateCellRenderer` now answers every unparsable value with the shared
 *     affordance, and this file's two `date` assertions moved with it — the
 *     census row to `true`, and THE BOUNDARY to the fix's own record.
 *
 * ── The direction is not open per family: `valueSchemaFor`'s arm decides ──
 * Read from `@objectstack/spec` `src/data/field-value.zod.ts` (v17.3.0), per
 * family, before choosing — the card's instruction, and it separated the
 * families that print from the family that does not:
 *
 *   - `email` / `url` / `phone` / `color` are `STRING_VALUE_TYPES` — "Value is
 *     a plain string", write seam `z.string()`. The SAME set objectui#8580
 *     ruled on for `markdown` / `html` / `richtext`, and that ruling settles
 *     `{}` away from the "no value" affordance and toward the family's
 *     existing coercion: the record IS storing something, so "No value" would
 *     be false. So they print `coerceToSafeValue`'s answer — pinned BYTE-EQUAL
 *     to what `text` prints for `{}` below, so the rule cannot drift — and
 *     they draw no affordance that asserts more than that: `mailto:[Object]`
 *     cannot send mail, a copy button offers `[Object]` to the clipboard, and
 *     `background: [object Object]` is a declaration the browser drops.
 *   - the option families resolve through `SINGLE_OPTION_TYPES` /
 *     `MULTI_OPTION_TYPES` to `z.enum(codes)` — or `z.string()` when no
 *     options are declared. Either way the value is a STRING code, so the same
 *     coercion answers it; the badge stays, because a badge is how this family
 *     shows any code it was given, including one it does not recognize.
 *     (`status` is an objectui renderer alias, not a spec `FieldType`; it
 *     reaches `SelectCellRenderer` through this repo's own map and inherits
 *     the ruling from it, not from the spec.)
 *   - `user` shares `REFERENCE_VALUE_TYPES`' arm with `lookup` /
 *     `master_detail` / `tree`: `ReferenceIdValueSchema` when stored, and in
 *     expanded form `z.union([ReferenceIdValueSchema, z.record(…)])` — an
 *     OPEN record, whose "shape is that object's contract, not this field's".
 *     The spec therefore cannot tell `user` from `lookup` here, and `lookup`
 *     already answers an object it cannot name with the coerced text. Pinned
 *     byte-equal to `lookup` below.
 *   - `file` / `video` / `audio` are the family where the answer DIFFERS, and
 *     the spec names the input: `FileValueSchema` makes `url` "the one
 *     required member" and says a value with no `url` — "an empty object, a
 *     `{ name }` fragment, a number — is now rejected". `{}` is a value of
 *     neither the stored (`sys_file` id) nor the expanded form, so the record
 *     holds no file and "No value" is TRUE of it. `image` / `avatar` — the
 *     same spec family — already answered `{}` that way; `file` now agrees,
 *     and the two are pinned against each other.
 *
 * ⛔ Nothing here invents a renderer-side fallback (AGENTS.md #0.1). Every
 * family lands on a coercion this package already had, or on the affordance a
 * sibling in its own spec family already drew.
 *
 * ── Why the load-bearing cases are the ones that must NOT move ────────────
 * The caricature is the shared `EmptyValue` drawn for every cell — "the
 * mutation that makes the code answer the same thing for everything". It
 * satisfies every vivid assertion in this file: the checked checkbox is gone,
 * the `mailto:[Object]` anchor is gone, the `[object Object]` swatch is gone.
 * What refuses it is:
 *
 *   1. `THE CENSUS`, whose `{}` column pins the twenty types that already
 *      coerced correctly — `number` / `currency` / `percent` / `slider` /
 *      `rating` / `text` / `code` / `formula` / `lookup` among them — as
 *      printing their text, and
 *   2. `POPULATED`, which renders a real value into all 53 types and asserts
 *      that NONE of them draws the affordance.
 *
 * Both were RUN against the caricature; the observed failure sentences are
 * recorded in the PR, per test, from vitest's JSON reporter.
 *
 * ⚠️ A matrix pin over an EMPTY set passes. Both matrices run through
 * {@link assertCensusComplete}, which asserts the exact expected size before
 * anything is rendered, and `THE CENSUS` includes a meta-test proving that
 * guard throws when the set is emptied — a census that silently renders 0
 * types is the failure mode this file exists to avoid.
 *
 * ── Assertion order ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Each defect case asserts the ARTEFACT'S ABSENCE first (no anchor, no
 * swatch, no avatar, no `[Object Object]`, no chip) and the replacement
 * second, so the unfixed tree fails on a different sentence from a harness
 * that has lost its navigation target. Both were observed.
