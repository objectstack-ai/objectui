/**
 * DatasetWidget — renders a dashboard widget that binds to a semantic-layer
 * `dataset` (ADR-0021) instead of an inline `object` + `valueField` query.
 *
 * It selects the dataset's dimensions/measures BY NAME and runs them through
 * `dataSource.queryDataset` — the same governed path the dataset preview and
 * dataset-bound reports use — so the numbers match everywhere.
 *
 * Rendering dispatch (by `widget.type`):
 *  - metric / kpi / gauge / solid-gauge / bullet (or no dimensions) → KPI value
 *    with the measure's display label + format.
 *  - table / pivot → a grouped table of `dimensions` + `values`. Rows drill
 *    through to the underlying records (ADR-0021 D2) when the server returns the
 *    dataset's `object` + dimension→field mapping.
 *  - bar / column / horizontal-bar / line / area / pie / donut / funnel /
 *    scatter / radar / treemap / sankey → the shared advanced `chart` renderer
 *    with its TRUE chart type and one series per measure. A type the renderer
 *    can't draw maps to its closest family (never a silent blank bar).
 *
 * Errors surface instead of silently showing wrong/empty numbers.
 *
 * Field access goes through `as any` because the bundled `@object-ui/types`
 * `DashboardWidgetSchema` only gains `dataset`/`dimensions`/`values` once
 * objectui bumps its `@objectstack/spec` dependency (cross-repo spec skew).

  // `values[0]` and stops — no warning, no console message, no visual tell. A
  // tile answering a NARROWER question than its metadata asked still reads as a
  // finished product, and that silence is the defect (ADR-0049
  // declared-but-unenforced), not the count of numbers on screen.
  //
  // This makes the drop AUDIBLE. It deliberately does NOT render the dropped
  // measures: giving `values[1..]` rendering semantics they do not have today
  // widens the authoring surface (objectui#8894 option (a), a separate card on
  // the manual-floor route), so the markup below is byte-unchanged and the
  // measures after the first are still dropped — objectui#8887 pins both of

  //
  // ⚠️ "Queried … never displayed", NOT "ignored": the extra measures are not

  // on a metric-TYPE widget that also declares dimensions, decides which row
  // becomes `rows[0]` and therefore which number is shown. Only the DISPLAY
  // drops them, and only that is what this claims.
  //
  // The message itself is the effect's dependency, so it speaks once per mount
  // and again only when what it would say changes. A module-level one-shot Set

  // is derived from it during render, one memo down, because that derivation is
  // where the locale bundle applies (objectui#4030): keeping the fetched
  // metadata locale-free means switching language re-renders the labels instead
  // of re-fetching the schema.
  //
  // The read itself — the host-authenticated `apiFetch` channel (objectui#4121),
  // the locale-free state, the effect deps, the best-effort failure shape — now
  // lives ONCE in `@object-ui/react`'s `useDatasetDimensionMeta`, shared with
  // the dataset report block (objectui#4389). It was written out here and again
  // in plugin-report by PR #4388; both copies stated the same two bug fixes, and
  // that is precisely the drift #4389 was filed to close. What stays local is
  // the part that is genuinely this widget's: WHICH dimensions to resolve, and
  // the chart-only colour/order derivation in the memo below.
  //
  // The METRIC branch renders ONE measure value plus that measure's header
  // label — a dimension's value never reaches its output in any spelling — so
  // there is nothing on that path to relabel and resolving would be a metadata
  // read nothing consumes (objectui#4263, pinned via `enabled`).
  //
  // Which dimensions resolve (objectui#4263 → #4330): EVERY dimension, on every
  // non-metric widget type — one rule, no per-widget-type dialect. #4263 ruled a
  // narrower one: on table/pivot the SERVER resolves a LOCAL dimension's display
  // label (ADR-0021), so this client net stayed off there and opened only for
  // DOTTED paths, where the server is silent too. That boundary was ruled for
  // LABEL RESOLUTION — "the label already exists, don't produce it twice" — and
  // it held exactly as long as resolution was the only thing downstream of the
  // read. objectui#4030 / PR #4324 put a second consumer there: the locale
  // bundle, which needs the option LIST, not the label. So a local select on a
  // table had its label resolved by the server, in English, with nothing on the
  // client to translate it against — the cells read `Domestic` beside a related
  // list reading 国内 (objectui#4330). The read is what closes that, and the PM
  // amended the #4263 boundary deliberately for it.
  //
  // It is not a second resolution: `buildDimensionLabelMap` carries BOTH the
  // stored value and the AUTHORED label as keys, and `relabelDimensions` is
  // value-wise and idempotent — a server-resolved `Domestic` maps to 国内 once,
  // and under `en` (or with no bundle entry) the display equals the authored
  // label, so no key is emitted and the rows pass through by identity.
  //
  // WHY THE READ IS NOT GATED ON "the dimension is a select" (measured, see the
  // amended pins): select-ness is not observable before the read.
  // `DatasetDimension.type` is `string|number|date|boolean|lookup` — the spec
  // has no `select` member — and every select dimension in the live example apps
  // declares `type: 'string'`; on the wire, `AnalyticsResult.fields[]` types a
  // select column `'string'` too (the analytics cube registry's
  // `fieldTypeToDimensionType` default). The select gate therefore lands on the
  // read's OUTPUT, where it is exact: `resolveDimensionFieldMeta` yields an entry
  // only for a terminal field that actually carries `options`, so a text /
  // number / date / lookup dimension produces no map and no relabel.

    // right-alignment: first-click direction is a property of the column's
