/**
 * objectui#8813 — the public form `/f/:slug` resolves its section headings and
 * field labels through the app's i18n bundle. Seam 2 of #8408.
 *
 * ## The defect, in the DOM
 *
 * A `zh-CN` visitor opening a published form was greeted by "Your application"
 * — the string the author typed while building the form — even though the app
 * bundle carried `objects.ats_inquiry._sections.apply.label`. The renderer
 * never looked: `buildSections` copied `sec.label` and DROPPED `sec.name`, so
 * the key `objects.{object}._sections.{name}.label` could not be constructed at
 * the render site at all. Carrying `sec.name` is therefore a precondition of
 * this fix, not a tidy-up beside it.
 *
 * ## ⚠️⚠️ Why a green test here proves less than it looks like — read first
 *
 * An `I18nProvider` IS mounted above this route (measured on the real tree with
 * a four-cell control matrix, #8813: a probe calling `useI18nContext()`, which
 * throws outside a provider, answers YES in `FormPage`'s exact route position
 * under the real `main.tsx` wrapper and NO with the wrapper removed). So
 * `useSafeFieldLabel` returns REAL resolvers here and nothing throws — which
 * inverts the usual hazard:
 *
 *   ⇒ a passing assertion proves the resolver RAN. It does not prove a KEY was
 *     FOUND. An identity function and a successful lookup are indistinguishable
 *     from the outside whenever the expected string happens to equal the
 *     fallback.
 *
 * Every leg below is therefore written so the expected string and the fallback
 * are DIFFERENT strings, and the file's discriminating power was measured, not
 * assumed, by two ablations recorded on the PR:
 *
 *   1. delete `objects.ats_inquiry._sections.apply.label` from {@link BUNDLE}
 *      -> `SECTION_HEADING_IS_TRANSLATED` FAILS (it reads the authored English
 *      fallback). This is the leg that can tell a found key from a missed one;
 *      given nothing throws, it is the ONLY one that can.
 *   2. delete `name: sec.name` from `buildSections` -> the same leg FAILS,
 *      because the key can no longer be built. That is the structural blocker
 *      this card exists for.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Not a provider-wrapped harness — and the difference matters
 *
 * The acceptance criterion is an assertion on the ROUTE, not on a fixture built
 * to make one pass. So the tree rendered below is exactly the tree
 * `App.tsx:215` declares — `<Route path="/f/:slug" element={<FormPage
 * mode="public" />} />` — with NOTHING wrapped around it that production does
 * not have. No `I18nProvider` appears in this file.
 *
 * The bundle instead reaches the resolvers the way it reaches every unwrapped
 * consumer: `createI18n` registers its instance as react-i18next's
 * process-global (via `initReactI18next`), and `useTranslation` binds to that
 * global whenever no context supplies one — the same mechanism, pinned in
 * `packages/i18n/src/__tests__/useObjectLabel-identity-5564.test.tsx`, that
 * makes `useSafeFieldLabel` provider-optional in the first place. Wrapping the
 * route in a provider would test that a provider works; this tests that the
 * ROUTE resolves.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The key is the section's stable `name`, never its authored label
 *
 * `KEY_IS_THE_SECTION_NAME_NOT_THE_LABEL` fences that with a decoy entry filed
 * under the authored heading. The same rule is pinned for the sibling renderer
 * by `packages/plugin-form/src/__tests__/sectionLabelI18n.test.tsx`, and that
 * pin exists because the two halves of the form renderer drifted apart once
 * already.
