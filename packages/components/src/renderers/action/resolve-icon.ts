/**
 * THE icon-name seam (objectui#5935). One tokeniser, one rename map, one
 * membership set — for the whole repo.
 *
 * ## What this module does, and the line it does not cross
 *
 * Its whole contract is `name -> component`, and `null` when nothing matches.
 * ⛔ It does NOT decide what a surface draws when the answer is `null`. That
 * is the maintainer ruling of 2026-09-03 (objectui#5935, comment 5523286738,
 * verbatim 「同意你的建议」, option C), taken over the 2026-08-31 shape that
 * would have given this function an `onUnresolvable: 'placeholder' | 'null'`
 * parameter. The reason that parameter is absent is measured, not stylistic:
 * the tree has FOUR unresolvable behaviours, not two —
 *
 *   - `null`                          — this module's callers by default,
 *                                       `plugin-list/TabBar`, `plugin-view/ViewSwitcher`
 *   - `SquareDashed` placeholder+warn — `renderers/basic/icon.tsx` (objectui#5631,
 *                                       maintainer 2026-08-22, 一字不动)
 *   - an `Inbox` fallback glyph       — `plugin-detail/RelatedList`, `plugin-list/ListView`
 *   - a 3-character name chip         — `app-shell` `previews/ActionPreview`
 *
 * — so a two-valued knob could not have expressed the tree it was meant to
 * consolidate, and widening it to four would have published a presentation
 * decision on a lookup function. Each call site keeps its own fallback, at the
 * call site, visibly. `resolveIcon(x) ?? Inbox` is not a hidden divergence: it
 * is local and there is nothing for it to disagree with, unlike the three
 * tokenisers this seam replaced.
 *
 * ⭐ That contract is why the resolution below stayed SYNCHRONOUS when the
 * GLYPH became lazy (objectui#9251). All four behaviours above are chosen from
 * `null` vs not-`null` while the caller renders; an answer that had to be
 * awaited would have published a loading state into every one of them. The
 * membership question is answered from a static list, in the same tick, exactly
 * as before — only the SVG path data now arrives later.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The `icons` record is not read here, and must not come back
 *
 * This module used to answer `name -> component` by indexing lucide's runtime
 * `icons` record. A namespace object has no dead members, so that one index
 * pulled every icon module into the console's eager closure: measured on the
 * console build at `ac05d4f4dd`, 1,781 icon module definitions inside
 * `assets/ui-components-*.js`, in a chunk of 1,535,917 raw / 397,091 gzipped
 * bytes. The maintainer ruling of 2026-09-13 (objectui#9251, decision batch
 * #132 item 4, 「同意」) took it off that path, verbatim:
 *
 *   「`icons` 总表不再 eager:图标按名经动态导入表解析(Door 1 已证明该表几乎
 *     免费);合法图标名集合由构建期生成的静态名单提供(⛔ 不从
 *     `Object.keys(icons)` 推导 ⇒ #9204 救援 A 拒绝);总表的每个读点
 *     (`check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs` 普查着)迁到懒解析;验收 = 页面
 *     实际字节减少,不是那一行变绿」
 *
 * So, precisely:
 *
 *   - MEMBERSHIP comes from `lib/lucide-record-icon-names.ts`, generated from
 *     lucide's own export manifest by
 *     `scripts/regenerate-lucide-record-icon-names.mjs`. ⛔ Never from
 *     `Object.keys(icons)` — that derivation IS the eager record, written a
 *     second way, and objectui#9204's rescue option A is refused by name in the
 *     ruling above for exactly that reason.
 *   - The GLYPH comes through `dynamicIconImports`, lucide's dynamic-import
 *     map, which objectui#9204 measured to be nearly free in this context
 *     (deferring it cost +923 gzipped bytes). ⛔ Keeping that map is part of the
 *     ruling, not an accident. The map is used directly rather than through
 *     `DynamicIcon` for one reason: `DynamicIcon` renders `null` while it
 *     loads, and `createElement(Fallback)` passes its fallback no props, so
 *     neither of its two states can carry the caller's `className` or lucide's
 *     per-icon classes. See {@link EMPTY_ICON_NODE}.
 *   - The VOCABULARY is unchanged: it is still the record's 1,781 keys and ⛔
 *     not `lucide-react/dynamic.mjs`'s `iconNames`, which is a strict superset
 *     that still carries `edit`, `smile`, `filter` and `alert-triangle` —
 *     spellings lucide RETIRED from the record and that this repo's authored
 *     names must keep failing on. `scripts/check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs`
 *     is what holds the two apart, and it censuses this module as the one
 *     record-vocabulary site.
 *
 * ## ⛔ A new icon-rendering container does NOT bring its own resolver
 *
 * Ruling point 4 of 2026-08-31 (comment 5472612351, verbatim 「同意」):
 * 「本裁定后新容器 ⛔ 不得再自带解析器,一律走 seam」. This is mechanically
 * enforced, not merely asked for — `scripts/check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs`
 * rediscovers every module that reads the record vocabulary and fails when the
 * discovered set differs from its declared census in EITHER direction. That
 * census is this file alone. A container that hand-rolls a lookup turns the
 * gate red on the commit that adds it.
 *
 * ## The tokeniser is MEASURED, not chosen
 *
 * `split(/[-_\s]+/)` with `Home -> House` applied universally, established by
 * the pre-dispatch enumeration required by the 2026-08-31 ruling
 * (objectui#5935, comment 5522254814) — four independent instruments, each
 * with a control that fired in the same run: a cross-product upper bound over
 * every authored name x all seven surfaces, a bound-free differential over
 * 8,298 spellings derived from all 1,767 live record keys, an AST sweep over
 * 349,813 string literals (25 forking literals, ALL in the same direction),
 * and the objectui#5631 pin. Its regression set is EMPTY in all three readings.
 *
 * ⛔ `split('-')` — what five of the seven sites used — is not adoptable: it
 * regresses 4,748 name-surface pairs in the bound-free space, stripping the two
 * regex surfaces of every snake_case and space-separated spelling they resolve
 * today. `split(/[-_\s]/)` is byte-identical to the adopted spelling over
 * 51,449 hostile spellings, and `.filter(Boolean)` is inert in this pipeline
 * (capitalising the empty string yields the empty string, and joining it
 * contributes nothing) — three spellings, two behaviours, one adopted.
 *
 * Why widening cannot regress anything, structurally: NO key of the record
 * contains `_`, whitespace or `-` (measured: 0 of 1767, with a firing control —
 * 95 keys contain a digit). So whenever splitting on `-` alone produces a live
 * key, that key contained no `_` and no whitespace, so no hyphen-token did
 * either, so splitting further changes nothing. The old resolving sets are
 * strict SUBSETS of this one.
 *
 * ## The module path stays `renderers/action/`
 *
 * It is where the shared resolver already lived and where sixteen importers,
 * the gate's declared census and three suites already point. Moving it would
 * be churn priced in merge conflicts against a card whose acceptance criterion
 * is that nothing observable moves.

 *
 * ⚠️ Without this, `svg.lucide-house` would stop matching anywhere in the
 * product and in 194 lines of this repo's own assertions, and it would stop
 * matching SILENTLY: the glyph still draws, so nothing looks broken until a

 *
 * Both spellings are derived the way lucide derives them —
 * `lucide-${toKebabCase(toPascalCase(kebab))}` and `lucide-${kebab}` — which is
 * one class for most icons and two for the 95 whose PascalCase key packs digits
 * (`Trash2` gives `lucide-trash2 lucide-trash-2`). The PascalCase key is
 * already in hand here, so only the kebab-casing of it is re-implemented;
 * `resolve-icon-classnames.test.ts` pins the result against the record's own
