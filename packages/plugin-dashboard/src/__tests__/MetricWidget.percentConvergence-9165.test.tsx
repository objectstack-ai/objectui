/**
 * objectui#9165 — the metric tile's percent branch stops holding a SECOND copy
 * of the percent display rule.
 *
 * `formatMetricValue`'s trailing-`%` branch used to decide fraction-vs-points
 * itself, spelled inside out:
 *
 *   const v = value > 1 ? value : value * 100;
 *   return `${v.toFixed(decimals)}%`;
 *
 * That is `percentDisplayValue`'s rule written the other way round — a
 * pass-through guarded by a greater-than-one test with the multiply in the else
 * arm — so it scaled everything at or below 1 and passed through everything
 * above. objectui#9071's census concluded the `plugin-detail` chip held the
 * only copy in the tree ("the only `num <= 1` spelling in the repo"): true of
 * the SPELLING, false of the DRIFT, because a literal `num <= 1` grep cannot
 * see this one.
 *
 * ── What this file measures, and why it is two different assertions ──────
 * The card's claim is AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO SURFACES, so the primary case
 * compares the tile's own rendered DOM text against the declared source
 * (`formatPercent`, which applies `percentDisplayValue`) — never against a
 * hand-written expected string. A hand-written string would restate one side
 * and could not fail for the reason the card names.
 *
 * ⭐ But a two-surface comparison is blind to a JOINT move: if a repair
 * overshot and dragged BOTH surfaces, the equality would still hold. That is
 * what the two LIT CONTROLS are for, and it is the one place a literal is the
 * correct instrument: `0.25 -> 25%` and `12.3 -> 12%` already agree today, so
 * they are pinned to their exact bytes. If they move, the repair overshot and
 * this file says so. The two assertions are not redundant — neither can fail
 * for the other's reason.
 *
 * ── Directions, predicted in writing BEFORE the run ──────────────────────
 *   1, -1, -5        RED before the repair (tile rendered 100% / -100% / -500%)
 *   0.25, 12.3       GREEN on BOTH forms — they are the controls
 *   convention pins  RED before the repair (bare '%' + toFixed, no locale affix)
