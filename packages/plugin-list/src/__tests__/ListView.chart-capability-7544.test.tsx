/**
 * objectui#7544 — the ListView capability gate never resolved `chart`.
 *
 * `availableViews` builds `resolvable` from each visualization's binding and
 * then intersects it with `appearance.allowedVisualizations` (ADR-0047:
 * whitelist ∩ resolvable). Seven visualizations had a capability check there —
 * kanban, gallery, calendar, timeline, gantt, map, tree — and `chart` had none,
 * so a `grid` view that declared a complete `chart:` block and whitelisted
 * `['grid', 'chart']` had its own whitelist filtered down to nothing and fell
 * back to `['grid']`. The block was spec-legal and authorable on both sides
 * (`VisualizationTypeSchema` lists `chart`, `ListChartConfigSchema` is the
 * `chart:` key); only the gate never asked.
 *
 * Same shape as objectui#5042 for `map`, and fixed the same way: the gate asks
 * the render branch's own resolver rather than carrying a second copy of the
 * condition. `resolveListChartBinding` is that one source — `case 'chart'`
 * routes on its `shape` and reads its fields, the gate reads its `resolves`.
 *
 * BOTH HALVES ARE PINNED HERE ON PURPOSE. Offering `chart` whenever it is
 * whitelisted would pass the first half and is worse than the bug: with no
 * block the render branch has nothing an author declared to plot. The gate
 * must offer exactly the blocks that render from the author's own names, and
 * the last describe below pins that equivalence against the render branch
 * itself.
 *
 * ⚠️ objectui#6152 round 15: the pre-ADR-0021 inline axes (`xAxisField` /
 * `categoryField`, `yAxisFields` / `valueField`, `aggregation`) were a second,
 * LEGACY shape here, offered and drawn. Every door refuses them by name, and
 * the resolver's legacy leg retired with the render path it fed (and its
 * `'name'` / `'value'` floors, objectui#7547's remainder). Their arms below
 * were TURNED, not deleted: a block spelled that way is now withheld, and a
 * view that forces `chart` renders the unbound node, which `ObjectChart`
 * refuses on screen (objectui#8168).
