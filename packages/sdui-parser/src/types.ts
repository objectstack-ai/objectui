   * Marks a data-binding input the server must resolve (ADR-0080 §6.3):

   * binding check knows what to resolve it against. Unrelated to
   * `type: 'object'`, the coarse control kind — a record-shaped value and an
   * object-naming input are two different facts.
   *
   * ## The vocabulary is exactly `'object'` — `'field'` is retired on this face too
   *
   * `'field'` stood beside it from the first draft of ADR-0080 and was never
   * written. It was retired on the serializer's INPUT boundary
   * (`RegistryConfigLike` in `index.ts`) under ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove by
   * the maintainer ruling of 2026-09-07 (decision batch #69), and on THIS
   * face by objectui#8315 — the residue that ruling did not name, which left
   * one published package narrow on one face and wide on the other.
   *
   * ⚠️ The argument for leaving this face wide was ANSWERED, not overlooked.
   * It runs: producer → reader is a subset relation, so a reader accepting a
   * value no producer emits is permissive rather than wrong. Three measured
   * facts decided against it (objectui#8315):
   *
   *   1. **This is not a pure reader face.** `manifestFromConfigs` RETURNS a
   *      `Manifest`, so `ManifestInput` is also this package's OUTPUT type,
   *      and this key is fed straight from the already-narrowed boundary. A
   *      union wider than the producer's is imprecision on the way out, not
   *      permissiveness on the way in.
   *   2. **Its sibling is a pure producer face.**
   *      `ManifestValidationResult.bindings[].kind` is written by
   *      `validateTree` by copying this key, so the subset relation runs the
   *      other way there — see that declaration. The two are COUPLED by that
   *      assignment: narrowing one alone needs a cast at the only conversion
   *      site, which is the lenient fallback AGENTS.md #0.1 bans. So "both
   *      narrow" and "both wide" were the only self-consistent states, and
   *      only one of them can be justified on the producer face.
   *   3. **The permissiveness protected nothing.** `binding: 'field'` has
   *      zero writers here and zero in the objectstack copy of this package
   *      (measured 2026-09-09 on both heads, each with a firing
   *      `binding: 'object'` control), and the only manifest producer in
   *      either tree is `manifestFromConfigs`, whose input face is narrow.
   *
   * The reopen route is the ruling's own: a MEASURED need for field bindings
   * is filed as a widening with the vocabulary decided then — not
   * pre-declared here for a producer that does not exist.
