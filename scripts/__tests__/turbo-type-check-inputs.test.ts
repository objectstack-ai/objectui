/**
 * objectui#3514 — turbo's `type-check` `inputs` list is hand-maintained, and it
 * has now been wrong twice for the same structural reason: a package's tsc
 * program reaches OUTSIDE its own package directory.
 *
 * Turbo hashes a task from its `inputs`. `$TURBO_DEFAULT$` covers only files
 * inside the package directory, and `globalDependencies` is unset — so any file
 * the program reads from elsewhere in the repo is invisible to the cache key.
 * When such a file changes, turbo does not re-run the task; it REPLAYS the
 * previous verdict. That is a gate whose answer depends on cache state rather
 * than on the code, which is the "looks like enforcement, isn't" failure class
 * this repo has already paid for repeatedly (objectui#3009, objectui#3181,
 * objectui#3494). It is not local-only either: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
 * persists `.turbo/cache` through `actions/cache`, so one poisoned entry rides
 * into later runs.
 *
 * The two known drifts:
 *
 *  1. `apps/console`'s `tsconfig.node.json` lists `../../scripts/vite-*.ts` —
 *     closed by hand with a `$TURBO_ROOT$/scripts/vite-*.ts` entry.
 *  2. objectui#3476 / PR #3513 added `../../vitest.config.mts` to that same
 *     project, and the `inputs` list did not follow. Measured on that branch: a
 *     real `TS2769` planted in the root config replayed `FULL TURBO` green.
 *     Closed by hand again, with `$TURBO_ROOT$/vitest.config.mts`.
 *
 * Two hand-fixes for one structural cause is this repo's threshold for a gate,
 * so this file DERIVES the requirement instead of restating it. It walks every
 * workspace package's real type-check program the way `tsc` itself assembles it
 * — the projects the `type-check` script actually drives, their `include`/
 * `files` root set, the configs they `extends`, and (for `tsc -b`) their project
 * references — collects every file that lands outside the package directory,
 * and asserts turbo's `inputs` cover each one. A THIRD instance of this class
 * cannot land quietly: a new out-of-package include with no matching input goes
 * red naming the file.
 *
 * The derivation immediately found a third instance, wider than the two known
 * ones: nearly every package's `tsconfig.json` extends the repo-root
 * `tsconfig.json` (and `examples/byo-backend-console` extends the root
 * `tsconfig.tier-base.json`), and neither was in `inputs`. Compiler options are as
 * load-bearing as source — flipping `strict` there changes every package's
 * verdict — so those two entries ship with this guard.
 *
 * Scope, stated so the narrowing is visible rather than assumed:
 *
 *  - ROOT FILES, not the import closure. This asserts over the files tsc is
 *    given (config `include`/`files`/`extends`/`references`), not over every
 *    module they transitively import. Building 40+ real programs to resolve
 *    imports needs a built workspace and minutes of CPU per run. The narrowing
 *    is sound for the failure it guards: a composite project must list every
 *    file in its program, which is exactly why both known drifts were `include`
 *    entries in the first place.
 *  - Cross-package references are still checked. If one package's program
 *    reaches into another package's directory, that is reported like any other
 *    out-of-package file rather than waved through on the assumption that
 *    turbo's `dependsOn: ["^build"]` covers it — `^build` covers declared
 *    DEPENDENCIES, and a tsconfig reference is not required to be one.
 *
 * The turbo-side plumbing this file used to carry inline — workspace discovery,
 * reading `$TURBO_ROOT$` entries out of `turbo.json`, and matching an input
 * glob — now lives in `./helpers/turbo-inputs.ts`, shared with the sibling
 * guards `turbo-test-inputs.test.ts` (objectui#4178), `turbo-lint-inputs.test.ts`
 * (objectui#4184) and `turbo-build-inputs.test.ts` (objectui#4185) — the same
 * defect on the `test`, `lint` and `build` tasks. Only the DERIVATION differs
 * between them, and it differs in kind: tsc programs here, Vitest configuration
 * programs there, an ESLint flat-config program for `lint`, and a union of all
 * of those for `build`. Two copies of a glob matcher whose whole doctrine is
 * "never approximate toward a match" is exactly the drift none of them would
 * survive.
 *
 * The tsc derivation itself moved out for the same reason when `build` came to
 * need it: it is `./helpers/tsc-program.ts` now, and that module's docblock
 * carries the mechanism and its narrowings. This file carries only the policy
 * over the result.
