# Layout System

ObjectUI provides a comprehensive layout system through the `@object-ui/layout` package. This guide explains how to use layout components to build professional application structures.

## Overview

The layout system provides:

- **AppShell** - Full application container with a top navbar, sidebar, and content areas
- **Page** - Individual page wrapper with header and body
- **PageHeader** - Consistent page headers with title, breadcrumbs, and actions
- **SidebarNav** - Navigation sidebar with menu items

## Installation

The layout package is included in the core ObjectUI installation:

```bash
npm install @object-ui/react
```

Layout components are automatically registered when you import ObjectUI.

## AppShell Component

The `AppShell` provides a complete application structure with a top navbar, a sidebar, and
a main content area.

**`AppShell` is a React component, not an authorable JSON node.** Four of its seven props
are `React.ReactNode` slots — `sidebar`, `navbar`, `children` and `rightRail` — and a JSON
document has no way to put a node into any of them. Compose the shell in React, and render
your JSON pages *inside* it. `app-shell` is not a component key either — what a
`{ "type": "app-shell" }` node does now is measured under
[There is no `app-shell` node](#there-is-no-app-shell-node) below.

### Basic Usage

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — `lucide-react` supplies the `NavItem.icon` COMPONENTS this example is about. It is a dependency of ten workspace packages (`@object-ui/layout` among them) but not a root one, so the specifier does not resolve in this gate's program (measured: TS2307 x1), and `pageSchema` is the reader's own page JSON (TS2304 x1). Probed with the icon import shimmed and `pageSchema` typed `BaseSchema`: the `NavItem[]` literal and the `AppShell` / `SidebarNav` props underneath are clean — 0 diagnostics -->
```tsx
import { AppShell, SidebarNav, type NavItem } from '@object-ui/layout';
import { SchemaRenderer } from '@object-ui/react';
import { LayoutDashboard, Settings, Users } from 'lucide-react';

const navItems: NavItem[] = [
  { title: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard', icon: LayoutDashboard },
  { title: 'Users', href: '/users', icon: Users },
  { title: 'Settings', href: '/settings', icon: Settings },
];

<AppShell
  navbar={<span className="font-semibold">My Application</span>}
  sidebar={<SidebarNav items={navItems} />}
>
  <SchemaRenderer schema={pageSchema} />
</AppShell>
```

Top-bar content goes in `navbar`. `AppShell` renders the sticky `<header>` element itself
and `{navbar}` is the only thing that fills it — there is no `header` prop. Main content is
the component's `children`; there is no `body` prop either.

### Props

`AppShellProps` (`packages/layout/src/AppShell.tsx`) declares exactly these seven. The
component destructures that fixed key list with **no rest element**, so anything else you
pass is built and then dropped on the floor.

These are React props, passed in JSX. None of them is authorable in JSON — there is no
`app-shell` node to write them on.

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sidebar` | `React.ReactNode` | no | Left sidebar node, a flex sibling of the content. Pass `SidebarNav`, or your own node. |
| `navbar` | `React.ReactNode` | no | Top-bar content. `AppShell` supplies the sticky `<header>` around it, so pass only what goes inside. |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode` | yes | Main content, rendered inside the `<main>` element. |
| `className` | `string` | no | Tailwind overrides for the `<main>` content element — **not** for the outer container. |
| `defaultOpen` | `boolean` | no | Initial open state of the underlying Shadcn `SidebarProvider`. Defaults to `true`. |
| `branding` | `AppShellBranding` | no | App branding, applied by `useAppShellBranding`: `primaryColor` / `accentColor` become CSS custom properties on the document root, `favicon` sets the icon link's `href`, and `title` sets `document.title`. |
| `rightRail` | `React.ReactNode` | no | Optional right-side rail. It reflows the content beside it rather than overlaying it; absent → unchanged single-pane layout. |

### There is no `app-shell` node

`app-shell` is not a component key. `registerLayout()` (`packages/layout/src/index.ts`)
does not register it, and nothing else in this repo does either, so a
`{ "type": "app-shell" }` node resolves to nothing and says so. Measured on this tree:

- `SchemaRenderer` replaces the node with its error panel —
  `Unknown component type: app-shell`, error code `OBJUI-001`.
- `sdui-parser` reports it before render, as an `error`-severity diagnostic with code
  `unknown-component` and the message `<app-shell> is not a known component`.

It **was** registered until objectui#4841, and the registration could never produce a
shell. Four of the seven props are `React.ReactNode` slots that a JSON document cannot
fill, so a node had exactly two outcomes: `children` was stripped by `SchemaRenderer`
before a node's keys were spread as props — `AppShell` reads its `children` prop, never
`schema.children` — so the `<main>` element rendered **empty with nothing logged**; and a
schema written into `sidebar` / `navbar` / `rightRail` arrived as a plain object, which
React refuses to render, replacing the node with an error box. Only `className`,
`defaultOpen` and `branding` ever survived the JSON path, i.e. the best result JSON could
reach was a shell with no navigation, no top bar and an empty content area. The key was
retired under ADR-0049 (enforce-or-remove) so that this comes out as a named refusal
rather than a page that renders nothing.

Two doors remain, one per capability:

- **Compose in React** — `<AppShell>` as shown above, with your JSON pages rendered
  *inside* it through `SchemaRenderer`.
- **The whole shell from metadata** — `AppSchemaRenderer`, registered as
  `app-schema-renderer` and declaring its `inputs`, which builds branding and sidebar
  navigation from an `AppSchema` JSON document and takes the page content as its
  `children`.

### Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to mobile/tablet/desktop
- Collapsible sidebar with state management
- Sticky header
- Scroll management for content area
- Consistent spacing and structure

## Page Component

The `Page` component provides a consistent wrapper for individual pages with optional headers.

### Basic Usage

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "title": "User Management",
  "description": "Manage users and permissions",
  "body": {
    "type": "container",
    "children": [
      { "type": "text", "content": "User list goes here" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### With Action Buttons

A `page` node has no action row of its own. Buttons are NODES, and they go in `body`:

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "title": "Products",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "flex",
      "justify": "end",
      "gap": 2,
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "button",
          "label": "Add Product",
          "variant": "default",
          "icon": "plus"
        },
        {
          "type": "button",
          "label": "Export",
          "variant": "outline",
          "icon": "download"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "object-grid",
      "object": "products"
    }
  ]
}
```

`label` is the button's text key — `text` is not a `ButtonSchema` key, and because
`BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()` nothing refuses it: the validator keeps the unknown key
and `button.tsx`, which reads `schema.label`, renders a button with no text.

> **⛔ `actions` on a `page` node is refused by name** (objectui#7926). This page used to
> teach `"actions": [ … ]` as a sibling of `title`, and it drew **nothing**: `PageRenderer`
> has never had a read point for the key, and `BaseSchema`'s `.passthrough()` kept the array
> rather than refusing it — so the author got a green validation and an empty page (before
> objectui#7933 it also reached the DOM as `actions="[object Object]"`). `PageNodeSchema`
> now declares the key as a refusal, so the same document fails with the remedy in the
> message instead of rendering silently short. Buttons in `body`, as above; on a record page,
> the `page:header` block's own `actions` — which are **action ids**, not nodes
> (see the [PageHeader reference](/docs/layout/page-header)).

> **⛔ `breadcrumbs` on a `page` node is refused by name** (objectui#8871). This page used
> to declare it in the Schema API block below and author it in two passages, and it drew
> **nothing**: no renderer has ever read the key, and `BaseSchema`'s `.passthrough()` kept
> the array rather than refusing it — the same silent-accept shape as `actions`, retired
> under the same ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove gate. The trail is a **node**, not a key: put
> a `breadcrumb` node in `body`, as [Breadcrumbs for Deep Navigation](#2-breadcrumbs-for-deep-navigation)
> shows. ⛔ Not the `page:header` block's `breadcrumb` either — that one is singular and a
> **boolean** display toggle, not a list of links.

### Schema API

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — a SHAPE excerpt, not an expression — the keys carry `?` optional markers and trailing prose comments, so the object literal cannot parse as TypeScript (measured: TS1109 / TS1005 / TS1011) -->
```typescript
{
  type: 'page',
  
  // Header
  title?: string,               // Page title
  description?: string,         // Page description/subtitle
  icon?: string,               // Optional icon
  // NO `actions` — refused by name (objectui#7926); put the buttons in `body`
  // NO `breadcrumbs` — refused by name (objectui#8871); put a `breadcrumb` node in `body`

  // Content
  body: SchemaNode,            // Main page content
  
  // Layout options
  maxWidth?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl' | '2xl' | 'full',
  padding?: boolean,           // Add padding (default: true)
  
  // Styling
  className?: string,
  headerClassName?: string,
  bodyClassName?: string
}
```

### Max Width Options

Control page content width:

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "title": "Settings",
  "maxWidth": "lg",  // Centered content with max width
  "body": {
    "type": "form",
    "fields": [...]
  }
}
```

Available values:
- `sm` - 640px
- `md` - 768px
- `lg` - 1024px
- `xl` - 1280px
- `2xl` - 1536px
- `full` - No maximum width (default)

## PageHeader Component

The `PageHeader` provides consistent page headers with a title, an optional subtitle,
an icon chip, and an action row.

> **The canonical author key is `page:header`; `page-header` is a legacy alias.** The
> snippets in this section are the `@object-ui/layout` component, which `registerLayout()`
> registers as `page-header` (plus its namespaced form `layout:page-header`) — that node
> still renders, so metadata already written this way is not stranded. The contract knows
> only `page:header`, though: that is the `PageComponentType` value and the
> `ComponentPropsMap` row binding `PageHeaderProps`, and it resolves to a different,
> record-aware renderer in `@object-ui/components`. Props written under the alias have no
> `ComponentPropsMap` row to dispatch, so nothing validates them — a misspelling there is
> neither rejected nor reported. Author metadata pages against `page:header`
> ([Slotted pages](/docs/guide/slotted-pages)); its props are not the ones below — see the
> [PageHeader reference](/docs/layout/page-header).

### Usage

```json
{
  "type": "page-header",
  "title": "Customer Details",
  "subtitle": "View and edit customer information",
  "icon": "users",
  "actions": ["edit", "delete"]
}
```

`title` and `subtitle` both interpolate `{field.path}` tokens against the surrounding
record context, so `"title": "{first_name} {last_name}"` resolves on a record page.
Unresolvable tokens collapse to an empty string rather than leaking the raw template.

### Schema API

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — a SHAPE excerpt, not an expression — the keys carry `?` optional markers and trailing prose comments, so the object literal cannot parse as TypeScript (measured: TS1109 / TS1005 / TS1011) -->
```typescript
{
  type: 'page-header',

  title: string,                     // required; {field.path} tokens interpolated
  subtitle?: string,                 // secondary line; {field.path} tokens interpolated
  icon?: string,                     // Lucide icon name, rendered in a chip left of the title
  actions?: Array<string | ActionDef>, // action ids, or inline ActionDef objects
  showBack?: boolean,                // back arrow; inferred from record context when omitted
  children?: SchemaNode[],           // rendered into the right-aligned slot; `actions` takes precedence
  className?: string,
}
```

`showBack` defaults to `true` when a record context carrying a `recordId` is in scope and
the header is not rendered inside embedded chrome (drawer / modal, which already provide
their own Close control), and `false` otherwise. Pass it explicitly to override.

`actions` is handed to the `record:quick_actions` widget with
`location: 'record_header'`. Its entries are **action ids** — resolved from the object's
own `actions` metadata, which keeps the definitions in one place — or inline `ActionDef`
objects. They are **not** `SchemaNode` nodes: a `{ "type": "button", … }` entry
renders nothing here.

> **Write `subtitle`. `description` is retired.** `@objectstack/spec/ui`'s
> `PageHeaderProps` — the contract for the canonical `page:header` node — declares
> `title / subtitle / breadcrumb / actions / recordChrome / showStar / showCopyId /
> maxVisible / mobileMaxVisible / aria` and has **no** `description`, and
> `page-header`'s registration declares four authorable inputs — `title`, `subtitle`,
> `icon` and `actions`. `icon` sits on exactly one of those two lists on purpose: it is
> an ADR-0087 D2 tombstone on the spec shape, which rejects it by name — "`page:header`
> property `icon` was removed in @objectstack/spec 17.0.0 (#6946, ADR-0087 D2) — no
> renderer ever read it … Delete the key." — while remaining a live input of *this*
> component, whose `<PageHeader>` does draw an icon beside the title (objectui#3829). On
> a canonical `page:header` node the key is gone; as a prop of this component it is
> live. The renderer used to read `description` as well, as a legacy alias; objectui#3789
> removed that read, so `subtitle` is now the only spelling this component draws. Stored
> metadata written the old way is not stranded: protocol 17's ADR-0087 D2 conversion
> `page-header-subtitle-alias` rewrites `description` to `subtitle` on header nodes as the
> stack loads — at every position a header can occupy, regions and slots and containers
> nested to any depth (objectstack#6775 / #6776) — and `os migrate meta` rewrites it at
> rest. See the [PageHeader reference](/docs/layout/page-header) for the per-key
> reference face.

> **There is no `breadcrumbs` array.** The component reads no breadcrumb property of any
> kind, in either spelling. The spec's `breadcrumb` is singular and a **boolean** — a
> display toggle on the canonical `page:header` node (see
> [Slotted pages](/docs/guide/slotted-pages)), not a list of links.

## SidebarNav Component

The `SidebarNav` provides a collapsible navigation sidebar with menu items.

**`SidebarNav` is a React component, and `sidebar-nav` is not a component key at all.**
`registerLayout()` (`packages/layout/src/index.ts`) registers five keys — `page-header`,
`page:card`, `responsive-grid`, `navigation-renderer` and `app-schema-renderer` — and
nothing in this repo registers `sidebar-nav`. What a
`{ "type": "sidebar-nav" }` node actually does is measured under
[There is no `sidebar-nav` node](#there-is-no-sidebar-nav-node) below. Compose the nav in
React, or use `navigation-renderer` when the tree has to come from metadata.

### Basic Usage

`SidebarNav` renders a Shadcn `Sidebar`, so it must be inside a `SidebarProvider` —
`AppShell` supplies one. Its rows are `NavLink`s, so it also needs a router above it.

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — `lucide-react` supplies the `NavItem.icon` COMPONENTS this example is about. It is a dependency of ten workspace packages (`@object-ui/layout` among them) but not a root one, so the specifier does not resolve in this gate's program (measured: TS2307 x1), and `pageSchema` is the reader's own page JSON (TS2304 x1). Probed with the icon import shimmed and `pageSchema` typed `BaseSchema`: the `NavItem[]` literal and the `AppShell` / `SidebarNav` props underneath are clean — 0 diagnostics -->
```tsx
import { AppShell, SidebarNav, type NavItem } from '@object-ui/layout';
import { SchemaRenderer } from '@object-ui/react';
import { BarChart3, LayoutDashboard, Users } from 'lucide-react';

const navItems: NavItem[] = [
  { title: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard', icon: LayoutDashboard },
  { title: 'Users', href: '/users', icon: Users, badge: '12' },
  {
    title: 'Reports',
    href: '/reports',
    icon: BarChart3,
    children: [
      { title: 'Sales', href: '/reports/sales' },
      { title: 'Analytics', href: '/reports/analytics' },
    ],
  },
];

<AppShell sidebar={<SidebarNav items={navItems} />}>
  <SchemaRenderer schema={pageSchema} />
</AppShell>;
```

Three things that block a copy-paste: `icon` is a **component**, not an icon name —
`SidebarNav` renders it as `<item.icon />`. Nested rows go in `children`; `items` is a key
on `NavGroup`, never on a `NavItem`. And `href` is **required** on every item, including
one that only expands children — it is the row's React key as well as its link target.

### Props

`SidebarNavProps` (`packages/layout/src/SidebarNav.tsx`) declares exactly these six.

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `items` | `NavItem[] \| NavGroup[]` | yes | The rows. A flat `NavItem[]`, or `NavGroup[]` for labelled sections — the array's first element decides which. |
| `title` | `string` | no | Group label shown above a flat, ungrouped `items` list. Defaults to `"Application"`. |
| `className` | `string` | no | Tailwind overrides for the `Sidebar` root. |
| `collapsible` | `"offcanvas" \| "icon" \| "none"` | no | How the sidebar collapses at or above 768px. Defaults to `"icon"`. Not a boolean. |
| `searchEnabled` | `boolean` | no | Show a search input that filters rows by title, children included. Defaults to `false`. |
| `searchPlaceholder` | `string` | no | Placeholder for that input. Defaults to `"Search…"`. |

#### `NavItem`

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | `string` | yes | The row's label. |
| `href` | `string` | yes | Link target, and the row's React key. |
| `icon` | `React.ComponentType<{ className?: string }>` | no | Rendered as `<item.icon />` — pass the Lucide component, not its name. |
| `badge` | `string \| number` | no | Trailing badge content. Rendered whenever it is not `null`/`undefined`, so `0` shows. |
| `badgeVariant` | `'default' \| 'destructive' \| 'outline'` | no | Badge styling. Defaults to `'default'`. |
| `children` | `NavItem[]` | no | One level of nested rows; the parent becomes a collapsible trigger. |

#### `NavGroup`

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `label` | `string` | yes | Section heading, shown in place of `title`. |
| `items` | `NavItem[]` | yes | The section's rows. |

There is no `active` key — the active row is derived from the router
(`pathname === item.href`), never declared. There is no `disabled` key either, and no
`defaultOpen`: that one is `AppShell`'s prop, not this component's.

### There is no `sidebar-nav` node

`sidebar-nav` was never registered, so the node does not resolve to anything. Rendering
`{ "type": "sidebar-nav", "items": [...] }` produces the renderer's red error box instead
of a sidebar:

```
Unknown component type: sidebar-nav
💡 Ensure the component is registered via registry.register() before rendering.
   Check for typos in the component type name. (OBJUI-001)
```

This is louder than the `app-shell` case above — nothing is silently dropped, because
nothing is parsed as props at all. The whole sidebar is replaced by the error panel.

When the navigation tree genuinely has to come from JSON, that path exists and is a
different component: `navigation-renderer` (`NavigationRenderer`) renders a
`NavigationItem[]` tree from AppSchema JSON, and it declares its `inputs`, so an unknown
key there is diagnosed rather than ignored. Its items are JSON-shaped — `icon` really is
a string name there, resolved by `resolveIcon`. `app-schema-renderer` wraps that up with
branding for a whole-shell-from-metadata setup.

### Features

- Nested menu items (2 levels) with collapsible expand/collapse
- Active state highlighting via React Router
- Icon support (Lucide icons)
- Badge/counter support with variant styling (`default`, `destructive`, `outline`)
- NavGroup support for grouped navigation sections
- Built-in search filtering (`searchEnabled`) across all items and children
- Collapse/expand animation

## Common Layout Patterns

### Full Application Layout

The shell is React; the page inside it is your JSON.

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — `lucide-react` supplies the `NavItem.icon` COMPONENTS this example is about. It is a dependency of ten workspace packages (`@object-ui/layout` among them) but not a root one, so the specifier does not resolve in this gate's program (measured: TS2307 x1), and `pageSchema` is the reader's own page JSON (TS2304 x1). Probed with the icon import shimmed and `pageSchema` typed `BaseSchema`: the `NavItem[]` literal and the `AppShell` / `SidebarNav` props underneath are clean — 0 diagnostics -->
```tsx
import { AppShell, SidebarNav, type NavItem } from '@object-ui/layout';
import { SchemaRenderer } from '@object-ui/react';
import { SidebarTrigger } from '@object-ui/components';
import { Home, Package, ShoppingCart } from 'lucide-react';

const navItems: NavItem[] = [
  { title: 'Home', href: '/', icon: Home },
  { title: 'Products', href: '/products', icon: Package },
  { title: 'Orders', href: '/orders', icon: ShoppingCart },
];

<AppShell
  navbar={
    <div className="flex w-full items-center gap-2">
      <SidebarTrigger />
      <span className="font-semibold">My App</span>
    </div>
  }
  sidebar={<SidebarNav items={navItems} />}
  defaultOpen
>
  <SchemaRenderer schema={pageSchema} />
</AppShell>
```

`AppShell` adds no controls of its own to the top bar — the sidebar toggle above is one
you render yourself, in `navbar`. There is no `sidebarCollapsible` prop: the sidebar's
collapse behaviour belongs to the sidebar node you pass (`SidebarNav`'s `collapsible`),
and `defaultOpen` is the shell's own initial-state prop.

### Landing Page (No Sidebar)

Omit `sidebar` and the content fills the width under the top bar.

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — a JSX excerpt showing one prop — `AppShell`, `SchemaRenderer` and `landingSchema` all come from the Basic Usage block above, and restating its five setup lines here would bury the one line the section is about (measured: TS2304 x3) -->
```tsx
<AppShell navbar={<span className="font-semibold">Welcome</span>}>
  <SchemaRenderer schema={landingSchema} />
</AppShell>
```

### Settings Page with Tabs

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "title": "Settings",
  "maxWidth": "2xl",
  "body": {
    "type": "tabs",
    "tabs": [
      {
        "label": "General",
        "value": "general",
        "content": { "type": "form", "fields": [...] }
      },
      {
        "label": "Security", 
        "value": "security",
        "content": { "type": "form", "fields": [...] }
      },
      {
        "label": "Notifications",
        "value": "notifications", 
        "content": { "type": "form", "fields": [...] }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Detail Page with Actions

Same rule as above, and it governs the trail too: the breadcrumb and the buttons are both
**nodes in `body`** — never a `breadcrumbs` or an `actions` key on the page.

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "title": "Acme Corporation",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "breadcrumb",
      "items": [
        { "label": "Home", "href": "/" },
        { "label": "Customers", "href": "/customers" },
        { "label": "Acme Corporation" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "flex",
      "justify": "end",
      "gap": 2,
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "action:button",
          "name": "edit_record",
          "label": "Edit",
          "variant": "default",
          "icon": "pencil",
          "actionType": "editRecord"
        },
        {
          "type": "action:button",
          "name": "delete_record",
          "label": "Delete",
          "variant": "destructive",
          "icon": "trash",
          "actionType": "deleteRecord"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "card",
      "children": [
        { "type": "text", "content": "Record details..." }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

A button that RUNS something is an `action:button` node, not a `button` carrying an
`onClick`. `ButtonSchema.onClick` is declared as a runtime slot for a host-supplied
function and the zod mirror refuses it BY NAME — JSON has no function value, and no
handler key consumes a declarative action object. The refusal is not the whole cost:
`onClick` is on `SDUI_DOM_PASS_THROUGH_KEYS`, so an authored string or object is
forwarded to the real DOM listener slot, and React throws the moment anyone clicks.
Measured, React's own error: "Expected `onClick` listener to be a function, instead got
a value of `object` type."

The handler name goes in `actionType`, which `action:button` forwards to the action
runner as the action's type; the runner dispatches to the handler registered under it.

## Responsive Behavior

The shell has exactly **one** layout breakpoint, at **768px** — Tailwind's `md`, and
`MOBILE_BREAKPOINT` in `packages/components/src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx`. There is no
separate tablet tier: nothing in `AppShell`, `SidebarNav` or the Shadcn sidebar underneath
them reads `lg` (1024px), so 800px and 1400px get the same layout.

### Sidebar, at or above 768px

- Rendered inline, as a flex sibling of the content — not an overlay.
- How it collapses is the sidebar node's own `collapsible` prop: `"icon"` (the `SidebarNav`
  default) leaves an icon rail, `"offcanvas"` slides it fully out, `"none"` pins it open.
- `AppShell`'s `defaultOpen` picks the initial state, and defaults to `true`.

### Sidebar, below 768px

- It leaves the layout entirely and becomes a `Sheet` overlay (18rem) above the content,
  which is why the content is full-width there.
- **Nothing opens it for you.** `AppShell`'s header renders `{navbar}` and nothing else —
  it adds no controls of its own, in particular **no sidebar toggle**. Render a
  `SidebarTrigger` inside `navbar` yourself; otherwise the only way in is the
  `SidebarProvider` keyboard shortcut, `Cmd/Ctrl + B`, which no touch device has.

### Header and content

- The header is `h-14` (3.5rem / 56px) at **every** breakpoint — there is no compact
  variant — and spans the full viewport width at every size. The only thing about it that
  responds is horizontal padding, and it turns at `sm` (640px), not 768: `px-2 sm:px-4`.
- Content padding steps three ways — `p-3`, `sm:p-4` (640px), `md:p-6` (768px) — with a
  taller `pb-20` below `sm` only.

## Styling and Customization

### Custom Classes

Add Tailwind classes to layout components:

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — a JSX excerpt showing the `className` / `navbar` / `sidebar` slots — `AppShell`, `SidebarNav`, `SchemaRenderer`, `navItems` and `pageSchema` all come from the blocks above (measured: TS2304 x6) -->
```tsx
<AppShell
  className="bg-background"
  navbar={
    <div className="flex w-full items-center bg-primary text-primary-foreground">
      My App
    </div>
  }
  sidebar={<SidebarNav className="bg-muted" items={navItems} />}
>
  <SchemaRenderer schema={pageSchema} />
</AppShell>
```

`className` is the only class hook `AppShell` itself takes, and it lands on the `<main>`
content element — not on the outer container. There is **no** per-slot className:
`headerClassName`, `sidebarClassName` and `contentClassName` do not exist. The top bar and
the sidebar are nodes you build, so style them where you build them, as above.

### Page Padding

Control page content padding:

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "padding": false,  // Remove default padding
  "body": {
    "type": "container",
    "className": "p-8",  // Custom padding
    "children": [...]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Structure

Compose the shell once and let the page JSON change per route:

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — a JSX excerpt showing one shell reused across routes — `AppShell`, `SidebarNav`, `SchemaRenderer`, `navbar`, `navItems` and `pageSchema` all come from the blocks above (measured: TS2304 x6) -->
```tsx
// One shell for the whole app; `pageSchema` is whatever the route resolves to.
<AppShell navbar={navbar} sidebar={<SidebarNav items={navItems} />}>
  <SchemaRenderer schema={pageSchema} />
</AppShell>
```

### 2. Breadcrumbs for Deep Navigation

Add a breadcrumb trail to help users navigate. It is a **node in `body`**, not a key on the
page — `breadcrumb`, singular, is the registered renderer:

```json
{
  "type": "breadcrumb",
  "items": [
    { "label": "Home", "href": "/" },
    { "label": "Products", "href": "/products" },
    { "label": "Electronics", "href": "/products/electronics" },
    { "label": "Laptops" }
  ],
  "separator": "/",
  "maxItems": 3
}
```

`separator` defaults to `/`, and `maxItems` collapses the middle of a long trail behind an
ellipsis while keeping the first crumb and the current page. See the
[Breadcrumb reference](/docs/components/data-display/breadcrumb) for the per-key face.

⛔ Not `"breadcrumbs"` on the `page` node — that key has no reader and is refused by name
(objectui#8871), the same way `actions` is. ⛔ Nor the `page:header` block's `breadcrumb`,
which is a **boolean** display toggle rather than a list of links.

### 3. Action Buttons at the Top of the Body

Place primary actions in the first `body` node, so they sit above the content:

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "title": "Orders",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "flex",
      "justify": "end",
      "gap": 2,
      "children": [
        { "type": "button", "label": "New Order", "variant": "default" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

⛔ Not `"actions"` on the `page` node — that key has no reader and is refused by name
(objectui#7926). A record page has a second door: the `page:header` block, whose `actions`
are **action ids** resolved from the object's own actions metadata, not nodes
(see the [PageHeader reference](/docs/layout/page-header)).

### 4. Max Width for Forms

Use constrained width for forms and reading content:

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "maxWidth": "lg",  // Better for forms
  "body": {
    "type": "form",
    "fields": [...]
  }
}
```

### 5. Sidebar Organization

Group related items with `NavGroup`. Pass groups instead of a flat list and `SidebarNav`
labels each section and draws the separator between them itself — there is no `divider`
item, and a row is either a link or a group, never both:

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — `lucide-react` supplies the `NavItem.icon` COMPONENTS this example is about. It is a dependency of ten workspace packages (`@object-ui/layout` among them) but not a root one, so the specifier does not resolve in this gate's program (measured: TS2307 x1). Probed with the icon import shimmed: the `NavGroup[]` literal and the `SidebarNav` props underneath are clean — 0 diagnostics -->
```tsx
import { SidebarNav, type NavGroup } from '@object-ui/layout';
import { DollarSign, Home, Settings } from 'lucide-react';

const navGroups: NavGroup[] = [
  {
    label: 'Overview',
    items: [{ title: 'Dashboard', href: '/', icon: Home }],
  },
  {
    label: 'Sales',
    items: [
      {
        title: 'Sales',
        href: '/sales',
        icon: DollarSign,
        children: [
          { title: 'Orders', href: '/orders' },
          { title: 'Invoices', href: '/invoices' },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    label: 'System',
    items: [{ title: 'Settings', href: '/settings', icon: Settings }],
  },
];

<SidebarNav items={navGroups} />;
```
