// Spec 17.0.0-rc.1 gave the spec's own `NavigationItem` a real type — it is no
// longer the `z.ZodType<any>` erasure objectstack#4171 was filed about. That
// removed the ORIGINAL reason this stayed a local interface, but not the
// remaining ones (#3177 triage), and they were never caused by `any`:
//
//   1. Shape. The spec models navigation as a discriminated union of nine
//      `$strict` variants with a `superRefine` exclusivity rule; this is one
//      flat, all-optional shape. Converging is a breaking change for every
//      consumer that reads a target field without narrowing — the verdict
//      already recorded in `__tests__/navigation-spec-parity.test.ts`.
//   2. Three semantics the spec has at NEITHER tier: `visible: boolean` (the
//      spec takes only a CEL string / Expression envelope, yet
//      `menuItemToNavigationItem` below inverts legacy `AppMenuItem.hidden` into
//      a boolean), `pinned` (backs `useNavPins` + `FavoritesProvider`), and the
//      legacy `defaultOpen` spelling. Binding deletes all three from the type
//      while their implementations keep running.
//   3. A separator carrying a `label`; the spec's separator branch declares none.
//
// So the symbol stays local and the KEYS come off the spec one by one — the
// `badgeVariant` precedent (objectstack#4115), widened here to every key with a
// precise spec counterpart. That is the part of the burn-down that is safe
// today: a restated enum or payload shape can drift, and now cannot.
// `spec-derived-unions.test.ts` pins the three blockers above, each written so
// it fails the day the spec closes it.

 * Sales, Service, Marketing).
 *
 * DERIVED from `@objectstack/spec/ui` (objectstack#4115): `id`, `label`,
 * `icon` and `description` flow in **by reference**, so a key the spec adds or
 * retypes cannot silently diverge here. The hand copy this replaces had already
 * lost `order` and `description` once (objectui#3088).
 *
 * `order`, `visible` and `requiredPermissions` were area-level keys until spec
 * 17.0.0 retired them (`AREA_VISIBLE_RETIRED` /
 * `AREA_REQUIRED_PERMISSIONS_RETIRED`): an area is a layout grouping, not an
 * access boundary — gate the navigation ITEM or the app instead.
 *
 * Worth stating plainly, because the retirement's own rationale says an area
 * "carries no gate of its own": objectui DID gate on them —
 * `AppSchemaRenderer`'s area switcher filtered areas by `visible` and
 * `requiredPermissions`. That filter is gone, and the gating it did now happens
 * one level down in `NavigationRenderer`, which is where the spec moved it.
 * The premise mismatch is recorded in objectui#3311. Per that issue's ruling,
 * area visibility is now DERIVED rather than authored: `AppSchemaRenderer`
 * hides an area from the switcher when none of its items survive the
 * item-level guards (`hasVisibleNavigationItems` in `@object-ui/layout`), so
 * the pre-17 "fully gated area disappears" UX is back without any authorable
 * area-level key.
 *
 * One key is pinned locally, for a reason that outlives a spec release:
 *
 *  - `navigation` — objectui's own {@link NavigationItem}, not the spec's.
 *    Spec 17.0.0-rc.1 gave the spec's item a real type, so this is no longer
 *    the `any` erasure objectstack#4171 was filed about — and it is still not
 *    bindable, for the three reasons the module header above records
 *    (`visible: boolean`, `pinned` / `defaultOpen`, a separator carrying a
 *    `label`). Precision is not equivalence: this is case 2c in the guard's
 *    header, and the umbrella verdict lives with the element type in
 *    `__tests__/spec-derived-unions.test.ts`, which is where the blockers are
 *    pinned one by one.
 *
 * Drift guard: `__tests__/page-nav-misc-spec-parity.test.ts`.

   * (`invalid_type`, expected boolean, received string) and so did

   * inherited the base's union and INVITED exactly that spelling. This member
   * pulls the declaration back to what the validator has enforced all along

   * RETIRED (objectui#7344; the objectui#6182 ruling of 2026-08-25 — the
   * handler-expression string dialect is not a supported authoring form — in
   * the objectui#6124 shape). No renderer reads THIS KEY, so no value here
   * could ever run. The zod twin refuses the key by name; author behaviour as a
   * node type (an `action:button` node with a declared action) instead.
   *
   * Re-measured at objectui#6854, which corrects the narrower claim this
   * comment used to make. `AppComponentSchema.actions[]` IS read — the standalone
   * runner's `LayoutRenderer` (`@object-ui/runner`) renders both the `'button'`
   * and the `'user'` arm — so "nothing reads `actions[]`" was never the reason
   * this key is inert. The reason is that no reader touches `onClick`: not on
   * the action, and no longer on {@link AppAction.items}, where that renderer
   * reached one through an `as any` cast until the maintainer ruling of
   * 2026-09-05 (option B2) deleted it. Guarded from the renderer side by
   * `packages/runner/src/__tests__/LayoutRenderer.appActionItems-6854.test.tsx`.
   * @deprecated Not part of this contract — the value was inert.
