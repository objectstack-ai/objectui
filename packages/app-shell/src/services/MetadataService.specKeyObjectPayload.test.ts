/**
 * objectui#6223 — the object payload `MetadataService` PUTs carries no key
 * `ObjectSchema` refuses BY NAME.
 *
 * Surfaced by the key-level parity gate built for objectui#5761
 * (`scripts/check-designer-field-key-parity.mjs`), once objectui#6223 gave it a
 * SECOND ORACLE. Until then the gate compared field shapes against
 * `FieldSchema` and nothing at all checked the parent document those fields are
 * nested in, so three object-level keys sat on the wire while the gate was
 * green. `ObjectMetadataPayload` is now one of that gate's object-level `wire`
 * shapes: `toObjectPayload` builds it and `saveObject` PUTs it whole to
 * `PUT /api/v1/meta/object/:name`.
 *
 * Measured against the installed `@objectstack/spec` (ESM build), whose
 * `ObjectSchema` accept set is 43 keys at 17.3.0 (42 at 17.2.0, when this file
 * was written; the one gained key is `editMode`, unrelated to the three below):
 *
 *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ ...base, group: 'Sales' })  => unrecognized_keys ["group"]
 *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ ...base, sortOrder: 3 })    => unrecognized_keys ["sortOrder"]
 *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ ...base, relationships: … }) => unrecognized_keys ["relationships"]
 *
 * The controls are what make that a KEY-BY-KEY result rather than a schema that
 * refuses everything: `isSystem` and `pluralLabel` parse green on the same base
 * document. Both are asserted below, first, before any claim about the fix.
 *
 * ## What this file does NOT claim
 *
 * It does not claim a reproduced HTTP 422. The card was explicit that whether
 * the deployed route rejects these today depends on what that route parses
 * with; the schema fact is the ground for the fix and is all that is asserted.
 *
 * ## Why the assertions are on bytes
 *
 * `undefined` is a key zod's strict object COUNTS and `JSON.stringify` DROPS.
 * An in-memory assertion on the object handed to the client and a wire
 * assertion therefore disagree exactly on the half-filled case, so every
 * assertion here reads `JSON.parse` of the captured request body.
 *
 * ## One `it` per key, deliberately
 *
 * Three keys were resolved. A suite that exercised them together would stay
 * green on a fix that landed two of three, so each key is pinned by name in its
 * own case: reverting one resolution reds only that case.
