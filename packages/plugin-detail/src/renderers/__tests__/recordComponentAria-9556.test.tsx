 * `record:*` — the `aria` bag is declared by the protocol and honoured here
 * (objectui#9556)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * objectui#9556 measured the bag as declared on six interfaces and read by one
 * renderer. Re-measured on this branch's base, the shape is SHARPER than that
 * and points the other way on both halves — which is why this file re-derives
 * every population instead of restating the card's (AGENTS.md #9):
 *
 *   - the PROTOCOL declares `aria` on all six blocks, so the declarations in
 *     `@object-ui/types` are faithful and a retirement would have to move
 *     `@objectstack/spec` first. Under the maintainer's standing principle
 *     (spec > implementation > docs), an accepted-then-dropped key is an
 *     IMPLEMENTATION GAP, closed by making the renderer honour it;
 *   - `record:path` was NOT the healthy row the card's table recorded. It read
 *     `(schema.aria as any)?.label` — the one spelling the shared ARIA shape
 *     REFUSES — and therefore discarded the spec-valid `aria.ariaLabel` it was
 *     credited with reading. Zero of the six spec-declared slots was honoured;
 *   - `record:quick_actions` was NOT missing a props interface. It declares one
 *     (`RecordQuickActionsRendererProps`) in its own module, `aria` included.
 *     What is true is narrower and sharper: the PROTOCOL declares no `aria` on
 *     `RecordQuickActionsProps`, so that block's read is unreachable for any
 *     contract-valid document.
 *
 * ## What each half of this file can and cannot prove
 *
 *   - The CENSUS cases read the INSTALLED `@objectstack/spec` artifact. They are
 *     the PREMISE of the routing decision, never its evidence — they were green
 *     before this change and are green after. They earn their place by going RED
 *     the day the protocol moves either boundary: declaring `aria` on
 *     `record:quick_actions` (which its own refusal message says it will do once
 *     objectui's renderer and the contract agree), or retiring it from one of
 *     the six.
 *   - The RENDER cases are the only half that discriminates the defect from the
 *     fix. A source grep cannot: `SchemaRenderer` hands a node's leftover keys
 *     to the component as React props, so a renderer can consume a key it never
 *     names (AGENTS.md). These mount the real renderers and read the
 *     accessibility tree.
 *
 * ## The alias fold is scoped, and that is asserted here
 *
 * The contract-refused `aria.label` spelling is read on `record:path` and
 * `record:quick_actions` only — the two blocks that already read it, where a
 * stored pre-contract document can carry it. ⛔ The other five do not, and the
 * cases below assert that in both directions, each absence paired with the
 * control that shows the same block honours the canonical spelling.
 *
 * ## Why the assertions are accessible NAMES, not attributes
 *
 * `aria-label` on a bare `div` reaches nobody — a `div` is `generic`, and
 * browsers expose no accessible name on a generic element. This block family has
 * already paid for that once: `record:path`'s `aria-label="Alternative terminal
 * stages"` sat on a `div` and was inert rather than untranslated
 * (`record-path.containerLabel.test.tsx`). An assertion on the ATTRIBUTE would
 * pass for a fix that no screen-reader user can hear, so every case below goes
 * through `getByRole(role, { name })` or `toHaveAccessibleName`.
