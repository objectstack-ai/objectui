/**
 * Zero-app console: the `component/metadata/*` destinations must resolve, and
 * anything unmatched must say so (objectui#3610).
 *
 * ## The defect, as it stood at objectui#3610
 *
 * With zero published apps, the system fallback sidebar offered two entries
 * that both landed inside `AppContent`'s no-`activeApp` branch:
 *
 *     sys-datasources -> /apps/setup/component/metadata/resource?type=datasource
 *     sys-objects     -> /apps/setup/system/metadata/object
 *
 * `isMetadataRoute` was a substring test (`pathname.includes('/metadata')`) at
 * the time, so both URLs passed the "no apps configured" guard and entered the
 * no-`activeApp` `<Routes>`. That branch declared `create-app`,
 * `system/marketplace*` and `metadata*` only — no `component/…` at all — and,
 * unlike the with-`activeApp` branch, no trailing `path="*"`. A `<Routes>` with
 * no match renders `null`: a fully blank screen, no 404, no error, no empty
 * state.
 *
 * ## What those two URLs are NOW (objectui#3660, #3739)
 *
 * Neither is anybody's navigation target any more. Both sidebar entries name
 * the metadata-admin engine's canonical routes directly — `sys-datasources` ->
 * `/apps/setup/metadata/datasource` (#3660), `sys-objects` ->
 * `/apps/setup/metadata/object` (#3739) — as does the home QuickActions
 * "Manage Objects" card. The two spellings above are ARRIVALS: bookmarks,
 * external links, and, for the `system/metadata/:type` one, the host
 * fragment's own alias route, which stays declared for exactly those.
 *
 * That is why this file still measures them, and why the `it` titles below name
 * the alias URL and its rewriter rather than the sidebar entry that used to
 * emit it: what is under test is that each alias still RESOLVES out of the
 * zero-app branch, and still costs exactly one hop. `isMetadataRoute` is a
 * segment test since #3638 (`pathSegments.includes('metadata')`), under which
 * every URL here stays true.
 *
 * ## Which spelling is canonical — MEASURED, and the opposite of the guess
 *
 * The dispatch presumed `component/metadata/resource?type=` was the canonical
 * shape (because `apps/console`'s `MetadataRedirect` rewrites *into* it). It is
 * not. In the with-`activeApp` branch `component/metadata/resource/*` is not a
 * page at all — it is declared under the comment *"Legacy: old metadata routes
 * built before the REST-style nesting landed. Redirect to the new
 * /metadata/:type/... shape"* and renders `LegacyMetadataRedirect`
 * (`console/AppContent.tsx`). The canonical spelling is `metadata/:type`, which
 * both branches already declare as the real `MetadataResourceListPage`.
 *
 * So the two spellings are NOT two pages: one is an alias that 302s to the
 * other. That makes the fix a pure mirror — declare the same legacy-alias
 * redirect in the no-app branch that the with-app branch already declares, and
 * the alias lands on a route the no-app branch has had all along. No navigation
 * URL changes, and the alias keeps its single canonical destination. The
 * assertions below pin the resulting *pathname* AND the redirect chain that
 * produced it, so both a `component/metadata/resource` that grew a second copy
 * of the page and a silently changed number of hops turn this file red.
 *
 * ## Scope of the stubs
 *
 * This file measures ROUTING — which route matches, which URL results, what
 * ends up on screen. The metadata-admin pages and the designer are stubbed;
 * their internals are other files' subject.
 *
 * `systemRoutesStub` below transcribes the host fragment from
 * `apps/console/src/AppContent.tsx` (`systemRoutes` + its `MetadataRedirect`).
 * app-shell cannot import from `apps/` — a different Vitest project — so the
 * rewrite is copied verbatim, including its `prefix` regex, and this comment is
 * the pointer back to the original. It is the `system/metadata/:type` leg of
 * the chain: without it that URL's route into this branch is invisible here.
 *
 * ## Why the chain, not just the endpoint (objectui#3661)
 *
 * A transcription can go stale, and this one did. objectui#3658 re-pointed the
 * host straight at the canonical routes; the copy here kept emitting the
 * deprecated alias, so the `system/metadata/object` case went on measuring a
 * two-hop chain that production had stopped producing. Nothing went red — the
 * assertions pinned only the final pathname, and that is identical either way.
 * Green, for a reason that no longer had anything to do with the code under
 * test.
 *
 * So `renderConsoleAt` now returns every location the router settles on, and
 * all four redirect cases assert that list exactly. A stub that drifts back
 * onto the alias grows a third entry and fails, naming the alias in the diff.
 * That is the only mechanism in this file capable of noticing.
 *
 * Measured, both directions. Re-pointing the stub at the alias fails exactly
 * the two host-rewrite cases, and each diff adds exactly one line — the alias,
 * in the middle, with the first and last entries untouched. That is the drift's
 * whole signature, and precisely why an endpoint-only assertion could not see
 * it.
