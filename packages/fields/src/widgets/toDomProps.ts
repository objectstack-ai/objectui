/**
 * The RUNTIME EXECUTOR of the "DOM pass-through" section of
 * {@link FieldWidgetComponentProps} (objectui#3291).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * Field widgets forwarded their leftover props to a control with a bare
 * spread — `const { inputType, ...domProps } = props as any; <Input
 * {...domProps} />`. Whatever a host handed the widget therefore became a DOM
 * attribute. Measured on `origin/main`, a real form + a real widget:
 *
 * ```
 * <input placeholder="PH-f" zzcanary="CANARY-STR" zzcanaryobj="[object Object]"
 *        zzcanarynum="42" id="…" type="text" value="" name="f">
 * ```
 *
 * The `[object Object]` this issue is named for is an authored field-config
 * key being `String()`-ed onto an attribute. React 19 does not warn: an
 * all-lowercase unknown attribute is passed through in complete silence, which
 * is why this survived so long.
 *
 * ## Why a whitelist, and not a list of keys to drop
 *
 * The biggest leak source is not any NAMED renderer prop — it is the open tail
 * of author-supplied keys. The form renderer destructures a fixed set of known
 * keys and forwards `...fieldProps` verbatim
 * (`components/src/renderers/form/form.tsx`), and `SchemaRenderer` is wider
 * still: it spreads the whole authored node as props and has no strip layer at
 * all, so on the SDUI path a widget's own spread is the ONLY line of defence.
 *
 * A blacklist enumerating today's renderer-only keys (`error`, `emptyHint`,
 * `dataSource`, `dependentValues`, `dependsOn`, `options`, `inputType`, …)
 * would pass every one of the canaries above and would not stop the next
 * authored key either. Only "keep the known-safe set, drop the rest" closes
 * it, which is what this function does.
 *
 * ## Declared = enforced
 *
 * {@link FieldWidgetComponentProps} already DECLARES the closed set of keys a
 * widget may receive, and {@link FieldWidgetDomProps} names the subset that may
 * legitimately reach a DOM element (objectui#3221). Until now that was a
 * type-level claim a widget could violate at runtime simply by spreading. This
 * function is that declaration's executable form, and TWO compile-time
 * assertions below bind them in both directions — forwarding an undeclared key
 * and declaring an unforwarded DOM key are each a compile error. Neither
 * direction can drift silently.
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT forwarded
 *
 * `role` and other HTML global attributes are absent because the contract does
 * not declare them. They reached the DOM before this change only through the
 * open spread. If a field node should be able to author one, DECLARE it on
 * `FieldWidgetComponentProps` first and add it here — do not reopen the spread
 * (AGENTS.md #0.1: fix the contract, never widen the consumer).
 *
 * ## Where the mechanism lives now, and why the key list stayed here
 *
 * objectui#4425 phase 2 promoted this whitelist to the SDUI widget contract
 * generally, so the MECHANISM — filter by a declared key list plus the `aria-*`
 * / `data-*` open families — moved to `@object-ui/core`
 * (`utils/dom-props.ts`, `pickDomProps`), where every plugin package can reach
 * it without depending on `@object-ui/fields` (the objectui#4409
 * dependency-direction method: `plugin-chatbot` declares `@object-ui/core` and
 * does not declare this package).
 *
 * The KEY LIST did not move, because it is not the same list. Measured on
 * objectui#4431:
 *
 *  - `name` and `disabled` are here and NOT in the SDUI set: both are legal
 *    only on form controls, which is what every widget in this package renders
 *    and what `FieldWidgetComponentProps` declares. `name` on the `<div>` an
 *    SDUI container widget renders is a leak — one of the 14 attributes #4431
 *    closed — and two widgets here already hand-strip it when they spread onto
 *    something that is not a control (`ObjectRefField`'s trigger,
 *    `FileField`'s dropzone).
 *  - `role` is in the SDUI set and NOT here: `SchemaRenderer` resolves it for
 *    every node from `@objectstack/spec`'s `AriaPropsSchema`, while this
 *    contract deliberately does not declare it (see "Deliberately NOT
 *    forwarded" above).
 *
 * So: one mechanism, two declarations, each bound by the assertions below to
 * the contract it executes. Not two judges.
