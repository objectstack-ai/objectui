/**
 * A static lookup option's `description` is SEARCHED by the popover typeahead
 * (objectui#6153, instance 2).
 *
 * The behaviour predates the card — `filteredOptions` has always matched
 * `opt.description` alongside the label, and `recordToOption` emits the same
 * key for fetched records. What the card changed is the CONTRACT:
 * `SelectOptionMetadata` (the declared type of `LookupFieldMetadata.options`)
 * now declares `description?: string` - so the fixture below is an ANNOTATED
 * literal — the excess-property check that used to refuse this exact document
 * is the compile half of the pin, and the search behaviour is the runtime
 * half. Behaviour unchanged by design; the test would have passed before the
 * declaration only with the literal laundered through a cast.
 *
 * ⚠️ This header called the key an objectui-side extension the spec REFUSED BY
 * NAME, measured on 17.2.0 (objectui#7014). `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 declared
 * it on `SelectOptionSchema` and the sentence became false in the other
 * direction; objectui#7635 corrected it. The key is now authorable on both
 * faces, which changes NOTHING about this file — the search behaviour under
 * test never depended on the authoring door, and that independence is exactly
 * why the boundary could move without reddening a single assertion here. The
 * contract half is re-derived by
 * `packages/types/src/__tests__/select-option-spec-extension-7014.test.ts`.
