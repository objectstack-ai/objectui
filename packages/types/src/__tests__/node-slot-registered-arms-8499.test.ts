/**
 * Registered, live renderers reached through a declared node slot resolve in an
 * arm of `AnyComponentSchema` (objectui#8499).
 *
 * ## The defect these pin
 *
 * Nine `type` spellings sat at DECLARED node slots in this repository's own
 * corpora and resolved in no arm of the union. Eight of them were registered
 * renderers; the ninth (`my-component`) is the reader's own plugin component and
 * carries a written exemption at `scripts/check-doc-component-types.mjs`.
 *
 * The damage ran the expensive direction: a reader following
 * `content/docs/utilities/runner.mdx`'s own instruction — "copy one, wrap it in
 * a page document … and save it as `src/app-data/pages/index.json`" — got a
 * document that RENDERS CORRECTLY in the browser and is REFUSED by `objectui
 * check`. The likely reaction to that is to stop trusting `check`, not to fix
 * the document.
 *
 * ## Why nothing caught it
 *
 * `check:doc-types` judges a `type` literal against the RENDERER REGISTRY (656
 * keys, measured at the time of writing); `AnyComponentSchema` declares 107 arm
 * literals. The two faces disagree BY CONSTRUCTION and nothing compared them at
 * a node slot. So the repair is paired with the comparison this file's third
 * `describe` performs — not the full `registry ⊆ arms` containment (552 of the
 * 656 registered keys have no arm, so that instrument needs a ledger this card
 * is not authorised to mint), but the two FAMILY arms compared against the very
 * arrays their registration sites loop over. A tag added to either array without
 * an arm here goes red instead of diverging silently.
 *
 * ## `line-chart` is deliberately NOT armed — the card's premise fails for it
 *
 * The card lists `line-chart` among the eight as a "REGISTERED, LIVE renderer".
 * Measured here, it is not. objectui#8499's triage admits arms only for things
 * that "运行时已经正确渲染" — already render correctly at runtime — so an arm
 * for `line-chart` would invent a capability rather than name one.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE REASON MOVED, and the fourth `describe` moved with it (objectui#8760).
 * When this file was written, `apps/console/src/register-plugins.ts` registered
 * `line-chart` as a LAZY STUB pointing at `@object-ui/plugin-charts` while that
 * package never registered the key, so the key was KNOWN to `check:doc-types`
 * and resolved to nothing at render. objectui#8760 retired the stub — together
 * with `area-chart` and `advanced-chart`, the other two of the same shape — so
 * today the key is absent from BOTH sides rather than half-present on one. The
 * arm is still owed the day a renderer registers it for real, so the fourth
 * `describe` now pins the retirement from both sources and fails if either
 * half comes back.
