/**
 * The gate that stops a test resolving a repository path from `process.cwd()`
 * (objectui#8953), and the floor under it.
 *
 * ## Why the enforcement lives HERE and not only in a workflow step
 *
 * Every test file under `scripts` runs inside `Test (shard N/4)`, which is a
 * REQUIRED context and subscribes `merge_group` — so the scan below is what
 * actually blocks a queue build. The `Lint` step added alongside it is a second, faster
 * signal on the same gate, not the gate itself: a workflow job of one's own
 * would report on pull requests and gate nothing.
 *
 * ## The two sides, and the floor
 *
 * A gate is only worth its run time if it can FAIL, and a gate that fails on
 * things that are fine is worse than none. Both directions are pinned:
 *
 *  - it FIRES on the real historical defects — the spellings objectui#7799
 *    repaired, including the one that was invisible to that card's own census
 *    regex;
 *  - it is SILENT on the files objectui#7799 MEASURED immune under both cwds,
 *    which are a false-positive suite with readings already attached;
 *  - and the population cannot collapse: a walk that finds nothing fails
 *    instead of reporting clean.
