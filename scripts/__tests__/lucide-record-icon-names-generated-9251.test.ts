/**
 * objectui#9251 — the legal icon-name set is BUILD-GENERATED, and ⛔ not
 * derived from `Object.keys(icons)`.
 *
 * The maintainer ruling of 2026-09-13 (decision batch #132 item 4, 「同意」) is
 * specific about the source, and about why:
 *
 *   「合法图标名集合由构建期生成的静态名单提供(⛔ 不从 `Object.keys(icons)`
 *     推导 ⇒ #9204 救援 A 拒绝)」
 *
 * Indexing the record is what put all 1,781 icon modules into the console's
 * eager closure. A membership set read from `Object.keys(icons)` is that same
 * import, so it would pin the record eager while LOOKING like a name list — the
 * shape objectui#9204's rescue option A proposed and this ruling refused by
 * name. The rows below hold that shut from the test side; part 4 of
 * `scripts/check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs` holds it shut in CI.
 *
 * ⚠️ Every "does not import the record" row runs its probe against a POSITIVE
 * CONTROL first — a file in this tree that does import it. Without that, a
 * probe that had stopped matching anything would report the same silence as a
 * clean tree, and the silence is what the rows are made of.
