/**
 * Which widgets the form renderer threads `dataSource` / `dependentValues` /
 * `dependsOnLabels` to — objectui#4790.
 *
 * The rule has two halves and only one of them belongs to this package:
 *
 *  - the reference-bearing field family, which is `EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES` in
 *    `@object-ui/core` — the same set the `$expand` builder and predicate-record
 *    projection read;
 *  - three widget-hint-only pickers (`object-ref` / `filter-condition` /
 *    `recipient-picker`) that no object schema can ever declare as a field
 *    `type`, so they cannot live in the core set.
 *
 * This renderer used to restate the first half as a private `Set`, with the core
 * side's TSDoc claiming the two "mirror" each other. They stopped mirroring on
 * 2026-07-13 and no gate could say so: `user` was in core only, the three picker
 * names here only. The membership assertions below pass against ANY set holding
 * the right members — including a re-inlined private copy — so they cannot
 * report that failure mode on their own. The identity pin at the bottom is what
 * does, exactly as in objectui#4770 / PR #4789.
