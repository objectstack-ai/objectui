/**
 * objectui#4600 — the standing validation gate for the `plugin-dashboard`
 * catalog entries, against **objectui's own component schema**.
 *
 * ## Which schema, and why this file exists at all
 *
 * The card that opened this measured all 9 entries as REJECTED and concluded
 * the corpus was teaching a shape the platform refuses. That measurement was
 * taken with `@objectstack/spec`'s `DashboardSchema` — and the maintainer
 * ruling of 2026-08-14 (objectstack#8593) says that is the wrong schema for
 * these documents, verbatim:
 *
 *   > An SDUI dashboard COMPONENT node validates against objectui's OWN
 *   > component schema; the spec's `DashboardSchema` governs stored dashboard
 *   > METADATA documents only and grows no component projection. `metric-card`
 *   > joins objectui's own CLOSED component enum as an explicitly allowed
 *   > objectui extension, not the spec widget enum.
 *
 * So the two rejection classes the card counted are non-issues by definition:
 * the missing `name` / `label` identity keys and the `{ type: 'dashboard',
 * title }` envelope are what an SDUI component node correctly looks like. Under
 * the schema the ruling names, re-measured on this tree, **9 of 9 are ACCEPTED**.
 *
 * ## Why acceptance alone is not a gate
 *
 * Measured on this tree BEFORE objectui#4600's change, `DashboardComponentSchema
 * .safeParse` also accepted:
 *
 *   - `{ type: 'zzz-not-a-widget-type', title: 'x' }` — `DashboardWidgetSchema
 *     .type` was `z.string()`, an unbounded hatch;
 *   - a widget with no `type` at all;
 *   - a widget carrying the retired pre-ADR-0021 inline analytics keys
 *     (`object` / `categoryField` / `aggregate`) — silently STRIPPED, not
 *     refused, which is the exact defect the card was opened about.
 *
 * A gate asserting only `.success` would therefore have passed by validating
 * almost nothing, which is worse than no gate: `examples/schema-catalog`'s own
 * `package.json` calls it the "single source of truth for example schemas
 * consumed by the docs site, smoke tests, and AI few-shot retrieval", and
 * `test/fields-form-hosted.test.tsx` records the objectui#3910 lesson in those
 * words — *"what they show is what gets copied."*
 *
 * This gate therefore audits three things, and the `deliberately malformed`
 * block at the bottom is the counter-probe that proves each one bites, by
 * running the SAME {@link auditEntry} the real entries run:
 *
 *   1. the entry parses under `DashboardComponentSchema`;
 *   2. every widget names a type in the CLOSED vocabulary (`DashboardWidget
 *      TypeSchema` — the spec's families plus objectui's two closed extension
 *      sets). The catalog holds itself to `type` being PRESENT, which the
 *      shared schema leaves optional for stored dashboards;
 *   3. no authored key is silently dropped. Each widget is routed to the schema
 *      that actually owns it — a `metric-card` widget slot holds an objectui
 *      COMPONENT node, so its body is `BaseSchema`'s (passthrough: `value` /
 *      `icon` / `trend` / `trendValue` are `plugin-dashboard`'s registry
 *      `inputs`, not widget keys), while every other widget is the spec-derived
 *      `DashboardWidgetSchema`'s. When this gate was written check 3 caught the
 *      stale or mis-layered keys check 1 stripped in silence; since
 *      objectui#6002 made the widget schema `.strict()` (and moved this same
 *      routing into the shared `DashboardComponentSchema` widget slot), those
 *      keys refuse loudly in checks 1 AND 3, and the dropped-key detector
 *      remains as the regression floor.
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT catalog-wide
 *
 * Fenced to `plugin-dashboard`. objectui#4616 records 35 non-dashboard gallery
 * entries still unregistered; a catalog-wide gate lights those up and is a
 * different card with a different decision behind it.
 *
 * Sibling gate: `plugin-dashboard-global-filters-spec.test.ts` pins the
 * `globalFilters[]` sub-surface against the spec's own `GlobalFilterSchema`
 * (objectui#4356). That one is about STORED-metadata fidelity of a sub-object;
 * this one is about the component node. They are complementary, not redundant.
