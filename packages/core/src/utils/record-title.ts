/**
 * record-title — the ONE shared display-name resolver for ObjectStack records
 * (ADR-0079).
 *
 * Historically ~6 surfaces (gallery cards, calendar pills, kanban cards, gantt
 * bars, lookup chips, related-lists, breadcrumbs, global search) each carried
 * their OWN divergent resolver. None of them read the object's declared
 * `displayNameField`, and each fell back to a slightly different hard-coded list
 * (`name`/`title`/`label`/`subject`/…) that excluded perfectly good name fields
 * like `activity_name`. An object whose records carry their name in
 * `activity_name` therefore rendered "Untitled" everywhere.
 *
 * This module unifies them onto ONE precedence, implemented by
 * {@link getRecordDisplayName}. Phase 2 promotes the object's declared field
 * (`nameField`) to canonical and de-prioritizes the legacy render-only
 * `titleFormat` template:
 *
 *   0. `options.titleField` — the caller's own DECLARED view-level pointer
 *      (gallery / calendar / gantt / map / kanban / timeline config).
 *   1. `objectDef.nameField` — the canonical record-title pointer (ADR-0079);
 *      a field the server can return and query, if present & non-empty. With
 *      the undeclared `objectDef.titleField` read gone (objectui#6531) this is
 *      the top of the OBJECT-level ladder, exactly as ADR-0079 states.
 *   2. `objectDef.displayNameField` (alias `NAME_FIELD_KEY`) — deprecated alias
 *      of `nameField`, kept for back-compat.
 *   3. `objectDef.titleFormat` — LEGACY render-only template, rendered via
 *      {@link formatTitleTemplate}. Kept working for back-compat, but a declared
 *      field (1/2) now wins over it.
 *   4. Type-aware derivation — the first *title-eligible* field from
 *      `objectDef.fields`, ranked name-ish-exact > name-ish-affix > declaration
 *      order. Skipped when `objectDef.fields` is absent.
 *   5. `Record #<id>` floor — only a truly id-less record yields `'Untitled'`.
 *
 * Pure (no React / i18n) so it can live in `@object-ui/core` and be imported by
 * app-shell, the field widgets, and every view plugin — exactly like
 * `percentDisplayValue` / `formatMeasure`.

/**
 * Put the object's name field at the FRONT of a **synthesized** default column
 * list, so a list no author ever configured still lets you tell its rows apart.
 *
 * Why this exists (objectui#7245): the three faces that synthesize default list
 * columns each took a declared `highlightFields` verbatim. `highlightFields` is
 * the ADR-0085 "most important fields" role, and its canonical consumer — the
 * detail-page highlight strip — deliberately *excludes* the title field,
 * because the strip sits directly under the page H1 that already shows it. So
 * well-authored metadata routinely omits the name from `highlightFields`: the
 * showcase `showcase_account` declares `["status", "industry", "annual_revenue"]`
 * against `nameField: "name"`, and its default grid rendered 14 rows with no
 * name column and nothing to distinguish them.
 *
 * A list has no H1 to lean on, so the same role needs the opposite treatment
 * here. This is not a new convention: `deriveLookupColumns` in `@object-ui/fields`
 * already leads its picker columns with the display field and filters it out of
 * the declared list — the record-picker equivalent of this problem, solved the
 * same way. This makes the list faces agree with it.
 *
 * MOVES the name field rather than only prepending a missing one: an author who
 * lists it third still gets it first, which is what "the column that identifies
 * the row" means. Order among the remaining columns is untouched.
 *
 * NOT for author-declared column lists. A view that declares `columns` said what
 * it wants; overriding that would be exactly the renderer-side second-guessing
 * AGENTS.md Commandment #0.1 rules out. Every caller passes a list it
 * synthesized itself.
 *
 * Three cases return `columns` untouched, each guarding a rule that already
 * governs these column lists:
 *
 *  - **No field def** (nothing resolved, or the pointer names a field the object
 *    does not carry) — a synthesized list must never fabricate a column the
 *    object cannot render.
 *  - **`hidden: true`** — the author said don't show this field. That outranks
 *    the fact that it also titles the record; every one of these faces already
 *    drops hidden fields from its own walk.
 *  - **DERIVED onto a system-managed field.** {@link deriveTitleField} filters
 *    by TYPE only, so on an object with no name-ish business field it can land
 *    on a framework-injected column — and leading a default list with a raw id
 *    is precisely the regression objectui#2702 / #2777 fixed. A *declared*
 *    `nameField` is exempt: `sys_migration` really does point at `id`, and an

 * field had a value at all: the H1 walked on to the next rung, while the grid
 * hid the row anyway — a field vanished to deduplicate against a heading that
 * never showed it. The ladder now calls THIS. One authority, not two
 * implementations that agree today.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not re-spell this test at a call site, and do not "just add a trim"
 * there: three things beyond the trim are part of the definition, and a second
 * implementation drifts on each of them independently —
 *   - an expanded/embedded reference object resolves through its Salesforce-
 *     style display chain and is EMPTY when that yields nothing (a bare
