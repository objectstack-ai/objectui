/**
 * objectui#9304 — no consumer may bind `useRecordContext()` through a
 * whole-context type assertion.
 *
 * ## What this pins, and why the read sites were not enough
 *
 * objectui#9197 retyped `RecordContextValue.dataSource` from an id to the
 * `DataSource` adapter and removed the assertion at every site that READS the
 * member. That claim is true and it landed. But in `record-activity.tsx` the
 * `const ctx` binding itself was already asserted to `any` one scope above, so
 * removing the narrower assertion on the read changed nothing the compiler
 * answers: `ctx.dataSource` was `any` before and `any` after. A file can be
 * cast-free at every read site and still be untyped.
 *
 * ⇒ the discriminant is the BINDING, not the identifier and not the read.
 * The card carries the measurement that forces this: a cast list keyed on the
 * NAME `ctx` produced a count that matched the real one by coincidence while
 * overlapping on only six of eleven entries. An equal total is not an equal
 * set, so this pin never counts — it enumerates call sites and classifies each
 * one.
 *
 * ## Why a text scan, and what carries the type half
 *
 * A cast removal leaves no runtime trace: the value was always complete at
 * runtime, which is objectui#9197's own argument. Nothing observable through
 * rendering distinguishes the repaired tree from the broken one, so a
 * behavioural test here would be green either way — the disease this card
 * describes. The two halves below are therefore split on purpose:
 *
 *  - the RUNTIME half classifies every `useRecordContext(...)` call site in the
 *    monorepo and reds on any that is immediately asserted. It is the half that
 *    reddens when an assertion comes back.
 *  - the COMPILE-TIME half proves the declaration really resolves here rather
 *    than degrading to `any` — the characteristic dead instrument on a
 *    type-only card. `Equal` distinguishes `any` from every other type, and the
 *    `@ts-expect-error` control fails as an UNUSED directive (TS2578) if the
 *    checker stops refusing a misspelled member. Both run under
 *    `packages/react`'s `tsconfig.test.json`, never at runtime.
 *
 * Every control below can fire: the matcher is proven on a synthetic asserted
 * binding, the comment mask is proven on a commented one, and the population is
 * proven non-empty and to contain the known consumers before any absence is
 * believed.
