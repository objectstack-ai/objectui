/**
 * A CLIENT-evaluated `ConditionBuilder` mount advertises what its browser host
 * really binds — objectui#9856, the declared cost of objectui#9645.
 *
 * ## The defect these cases reproduce
 *
 * objectui#9645 made a `scope="record"` mount advertise `RECORD_CONDITION_ROOTS`
 * instead of the engine's whole default list, and that is right for a mount
 * whose host this component cannot see: it is the set EVERY host of a
 * record-scoped condition binds. The two action mounts are not that mount.
 * `CONDITION_HOST_BY_METADATA_TYPE` rules the `action` tier `client` from a
 * reading taken at its evaluator, and an action's `visible` / `disabled` is
 * evaluated in the browser, where `buildExpressionScope` publishes the identity
 * roots and the feature flags. Declaring nothing there cost the author the
 * OFFER of every root beyond `record` — while the section's own hint text goes
 * on promising predicates "over the record / user / ctx".
 *
 * ## The pins are DERIVED, not retyped — both directions
 *
 * ⛔ No case below spells the advertised list. The membership case rebuilds it
 * from the two producers that decide it (`buildExpressionScope`, and the real
 * `usePredicateRecordContext` hook rendered in a probe), so it reddens when
 * either side moves rather than when someone forgets to update a copy. The
 * lint case runs each member through the same path the editor lints with, so a
 * root added here that the `record` scope REFUSES reddens as the objectui#8167
 * defect it would be, rather than reaching an author.
 *
 * ## The narrowing half is pinned too
 *
 * This list DROPS `previous` relative to the record-scoped default, because no
 * browser host binds it. That is the same ruling as the additions and the half
 * a reader is most likely to take for an oversight, so it has its own case at
 * the mount rather than only in a docblock.
