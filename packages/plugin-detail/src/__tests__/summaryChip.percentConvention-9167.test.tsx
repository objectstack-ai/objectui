 * ONE record, TWO places, ONE SPELLING (objectui#9167).
 *
 * ## What this pins, and why it is the second half of objectui#9071
 *
 * `percentDisplayValue` in `@object-ui/core` states the rule in its own doc
 * comment, and the sentence is the judgement: a third surface that needs percent
 * display takes BOTH halves from there — the scaling AND the convention — "or
 * this promise breaks again in the same place". objectui#9071 moved the
 * `summaryFields` chip onto the SCALING and deliberately stopped, because its
 * acceptance made "any value that renders correctly today would render
 * differently" a stop condition and the convention half moves several values.
 *
 * So the chip appended a bare `%` to the full JavaScript number while the list
 * cell (`formatPercent` through `PercentCellRenderer`) rounded to the field's
 * declared precision — `0` by default — and rendered through the locale's own
 * percent affix. Same stored value, same field, two readings.
 *
 * ## The evidence this card owes, run rather than reasoned
 *
 * Every case below drives BOTH surfaces in the SAME run, on the SAME field, from
 * the SAME stored value, and asserts they state the same string. A pin that only
 * checked the chip could not fail for the reason this card exists: it would go
 * green on a chip that had moved to a rounding rule of its own — the exact shape
 * objectui#9071 deleted and `percentDisplayValue`'s doc comment names as how the
 * promise breaks.
 *
 * `MOVED_ROWS` additionally pins the pre-card spelling as a NEGATIVE, so a
 * revert is red here rather than merely different: the whole point of the card is
 * that these values changed, and a table that only stated the new answers could
 * not tell a fix from a rewrite of its own expectations.
 *
 * ## Why the lit controls are a four-digit row and two non-`en` rows
 *
 * Recorded on objectui#9167 by the dispatching seat, from objectui#9268's run:
 * `0.25` and `12.3` are `en` and under four significant digits, so NEITHER
 * locale grouping NOR a percent affix can reach them — a same-locale,
 * low-magnitude pair is decoration that reads as reassurance. The rows that can
 * actually reveal whether the convention half was taken are:
 *
 *  - `1234.5` in `en` — four digits, so grouping shows: `1234.5%` → `1,235%`;
 *  - `de-DE` — the affix is a no-break space plus the sign, and the decimal and
 *    grouping marks swap;
 *  - `tr-TR` — the sign moves to the FRONT (`%25`). ⭐ This is the row no
 *    bare-append implementation can produce by accident, whatever its rounding.
 *
 * ## What did NOT move, asserted alongside
 *
 * The MAGNITUDE. This card touches the chip's TEXT only; the bar keeps reading
 * `summaryChipPercentPoints`, unrounded, exactly as the list cell's own bar
 * reads its `barValue` before formatting. `UNMOVED_ROWS` are the values whose
 * text was already identical in both places — they are green on both legs of the
 * ablation, and their moving would mean the repair reached past the convention.
