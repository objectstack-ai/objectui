/**
 * The derived STRICT AUTHORING FACE, and the three things objectui#8345 owes as
 * pins rather than promises (objectui#5250, maintainer 2026-09-04, decision
 * batch #25, option 2):
 *
 *   (a) a known-good document parses under the strict face;
 *   (b) a document with one invented top-level key is REFUSED, with an
 *       `unrecognized_keys` issue NAMING that key;
 *   (c) the tolerant face is behaviourally unchanged on the same inputs.
 *
 * (c) is the load-bearing one and the reason several tests below assert things
 * that read as obvious: the card publishes a SECOND face, and the whole appetite
 * rests on the first one not moving. "Unchanged" that nobody measures is a
 * promise; the tables below are the measurement.
 *
 * ## Two further properties this file pins, because the card's risk is there
 *
 * **The recursion point.** Since objectui#8344 a child slot resolves its
 * component arm to the component union rather than to the ~21 base keys. A
 * strict twin derived over the OLD recursion point would refuse every child
 * node's own declared props — the order-of-magnitude error objectui#7935 exists
 * to prevent, and the reason this card was blocked behind #8344. So a child
 * node's OWN component props being accepted is pinned as directly as the
 * invented key being refused.
 *
 * **Checks survive the clone.** The walker clones by patching a copy of the
 * def, ⛔ never by rebuilding with `z.object(shape)`. A rebuilt twin drops
 * `def.checks`, so every `.refine()` / `.superRefine()` on the way down is lost
 * and the face UNDER-reports red — the one failure direction that reads as good
 * news. Both the synthetic control and the live instance are below.
 *
 * ## Instruments, and one that is NOT one
 *
 * ⚠️ `vitest` does not typecheck. The type-level pins at the bottom are read by
 * `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` (the third program of this package's `type-check`
 * script) and by nothing else — a green vitest run says nothing about them.
