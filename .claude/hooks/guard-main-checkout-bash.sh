# guard-main-checkout-bash.sh — PreToolUse guard: the SAME worktree-first rule as
# guard-main-checkout.sh, applied to file writes that arrive through Bash instead of
# through the Edit / Write / NotebookEdit tools.
#
# Why: guard-main-checkout.sh is registered on the matcher "Edit|Write|NotebookEdit", so
# it only ever sees tool-shaped file writes. The identical mutation expressed as a shell
# command never reaches it — `sed -i 's/foo/bar/' packages/fields/src/x.tsx`,
# `cat > path <<EOF`, `tee`, `printf ... > path` all edit the shared primary checkout in
# silence, while CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md tell every agent that "a PreToolUse hook enforces
# this rule". Declared enforcement scope > actual enforcement scope (objectui#3435, same
# family as #3430). This hook closes the Bash half.
#
# The rule and the escape hatch are deliberately the SAME as guard-main-checkout.sh's:
# OS_ALLOW_MAIN_EDITS=1. One rule, one hatch — a second variable would just be another
# thing to forget.
#
# Repo predicate — lifted verbatim from guard-main-checkout.sh so the two hooks can never
# disagree about what "shared checkout" means:
#   resolve the target's nearest EXISTING ancestor dir -> `git rev-parse`
#     * not a git repo at all (/tmp, $HOME dotfiles, the scratchpad)  -> allow
#     * git-dir differs from git-common-dir (a linked worktree)       -> allow
#     * anything else (the shared PRIMARY checkout, any sibling repo) -> BLOCK
#
# PRECISION OVER RECALL. Recognising a write target inside an arbitrary shell command is
# heuristic in a way that Edit's file_path is not, and a guard that blocks work it does not
# understand gets switched off — after which it guards nothing. So this hook only claims
# shapes it can read with confidence, and everything else fails OPEN:
#   > / >> redirection (incl. fd-prefixed 2>), sed -i, perl -i, tee, cp, mv, rm, touch.
# Reads are never touched: grep / cat FILE / ls / git grep produce no write target.
#
# Fails open, deliberately, on:
#   - wrapped invocations: bash -c '…', xargs, ssh host '…', make, a shell script that
#     writes (same known boundary guard-shared-stash.sh documents for itself);
#   - programs whose writes live inside their own source text: python -c "open(p,'w')",
#     node -e, awk > (the target is not a shell token, so there is nothing to read);
#   - any target containing an expansion or glob ($VAR, `…`, $(…), *, ?, ~) — unresolvable
#     without running it;
#   - relative targets when the payload carries no cwd.
# Each of those is a hole by choice, not by accident: OS_ALLOW_MAIN_EDITS=1 already exists
# for anyone who means to write there, and the target of this guard is the reflexive
# `sed -i` an agent reaches for mid-task, not a determined evader.
#
# Writing ABOUT the ban must never trip the ban (objectstack#4890's lesson). Four layers:
#   1. quote-aware segmentation + tokenisation — a `>` or a `sed -i` inside '…' or "…" is
#      literal text, so `grep -n "sed -i" .claude/` and `echo "never sed -i in main"` pass;
#   2. heredoc bodies are stripped before analysis — the LINES of a `cat > /tmp/notes <<EOF`
#      body are documentation, not commands, and segmentation alone (which splits on
#      newlines) would happily read them as such;
#   3. a backslash-escaped `\"` inside a double-quoted word does NOT end the quote — POSIX
#      says `\` keeps its meaning before `"`, `\`, `$` and a backtick there, and nowhere else.
#      Layer 1 used to end the string at the `\"`, and everything after it — the rest of a
#      `node -e "…"` program — was then read as bare shell. A JS arrow function `st=>st.x`
#      in that tail put a REAL ASCII `>` in operator position, so the guard named the
#      following JS fragment as a write "target" and blocked a pure-read command (objectstack#10247).
#      Single quotes take no escapes: inside '…' a backslash is literal, as in a real shell.
#      OUTSIDE quotes the same escape holds and both passes must agree that it does: a `\"`
#      there opens no quoted region at all. Only tokenise() knew that, so segmentation read
#      the `"` as opening a region that never closed, went inert for every separator behind
#      it, and let a real `sed -i` through as a mere argument — the fail-OPEN mirror of the
#      false block above (objectstack#11131). The two passes now share the rule in both directions.
#   4. shell COMMENTS are text, not commands — both quote-aware passes stop at an unquoted
#      `#` that starts a WORD and resume at the next newline (objectstack#10570). A comment cannot
#      write anything, so reading one as a command is a false BLOCK: prose arrows (`->`,
#      `=>`) put a real `>` in operator position and the word after it was named as a write
#      target, while a `;` in the same comment first split it into its own "segment".
#      The word-start condition is the whole rule — `foo#bar`, `${x#y}`, `curl 'url/#frag'`,
#      `sed 's/#//'` and `grep '#'` are NOT comments and are left exactly as they were. A
#      comment never begins inside '…' or "…" (layer 1 owns those) nor inside a heredoc body
#      (layer 2 has already dropped those lines before this pass runs).
#
# Redirection is recognised on ASCII operators ONLY — `>` `>>` `<` `<<` and their fd-prefixed
# forms. No non-ASCII codepoint is ever an operator or an operator boundary, and this is
# structural rather than a list to maintain: every byte of a non-ASCII UTF-8 codepoint is
# >= 0x80, while `>` is 0x3e and `<` is 0x3c, so `→` (e2 86 92), `⇒` (e2 87 92) and `➜`
# (e2 9e 9c) cannot collide with an operator byte-wise or character-wise. That matters
# because `→` runs all through this repo's own AGENTS.md — one per Prime Directive clause,
# and again in the state-classification rules — so echoing or grepping that prose must stay
# allowed. The self-test pins both directions.
#
# Exit-code contract, mirroring both sibling hooks: 0 = allow, 2 = block with the reason on
# stderr.
#
# Self-test (block + allow + hatch + fail-open + no-jq matrix, no network, no build):

# --- heredoc bodies are text, not commands ---------------------------------------------
# `cat > /tmp/notes.md <<EOF` … `EOF` carries prose over several lines. Segmentation splits
# on newlines, so without this pass a documented example inside the body ("sed -i … main
# checkout") would be analysed as if the agent had run it. Drop body lines (and their
# terminator); the introducing line — which is where the real redirection lives — stays.
#
# A `<<WORD` that is merely NAMED inside a COMMENT introduces nothing — bash removes the
# comment before it ever looks for a heredoc. Reading one as a real introducer was fail-OPEN
# and badly so: the delimiter never appeared on a line of its own, so the pending heredoc
# was never satisfied and EVERY remaining line — including real commands — was dropped
# before either quote-aware pass could see it (objectstack#11133).
#
# Only the DELIMITER SCAN consults the comment rule; the line itself is passed through
# untouched, because both quote-aware passes already own that rule (objectstack#10570) and a second
# implementation of it here is exactly how the two would drift.
#
# This is why the fix is a narrow scan-side truncation rather than a comment-stripping pass
# run BEFORE this one: a heredoc BODY may contain an unbalanced apostrophe, and a quote-aware
# comment scanner run over the raw text would desynchronise on it for every following line.
# Body lines never reach this scan — they are consumed by the `pending` branch below and
# `continue` before it — so that hazard is structurally out of reach here.
#
# Word-start rule, identical to split_segments()/tokenize(): a `#` opens a comment only where
# a WORD could start — at line start, after a blank, or after one of `; | & ( ) > <`.

# --- split the command into shell segments, honouring quotes ---------------------------
# Verbatim from guard-shared-stash.sh. A separator inside '…' or "…" does NOT split, so
# writing *about* the ban is never caught by the ban. The same goes for a separator inside
# a COMMENT: `word` tracks whether the next character would open a new WORD, which is the
# only position where an unquoted `#` begins a comment — the comment then runs to the next
# newline and never splits, tokenises or contributes a target (objectstack#10570).
#
# What resets `word` is exactly what delimits a word in the shell: start of input, blank,
# and the metacharacters `; | & ( ) newline > <`. `{` and `}` do NOT — they are reserved
# words rather than metacharacters, so `#` right after one continues the word. That is not
# cosmetic: this pass splits on `{`/`}` anyway, and treating the `#` of `${#arr[@]}` as a
# comment would swallow the rest of the line — including a real redirect behind it.

⛔ Blocked: this Bash command WRITES into the shared PRIMARY checkout, not a worktree.
   command: $offending

Same rule as guard-main-checkout.sh — that hook is registered on Edit|Write|NotebookEdit
only, so the identical edit expressed as a shell command used to slip through in silence
(objectui#3435). This repo is edited by multiple agents at once: the shared checkout gets
its HEAD switched and its tree reset under you, clobbering uncommitted work. A feature
branch on the shared checkout is NOT enough; you need a dedicated worktree:

  git fetch origin main && git worktree add --no-track ../${name}-<task> -b <branch> origin/main
  cd ../${name}-<task> && pnpm install    # then re-run the command there

Always fine, no flag needed:
  reads of the shared checkout   grep / cat FILE / ls / git -C <main> grep …
  writes into a linked worktree  sed -i … ../${name}-<task>/packages/…
  writes outside any repo        /tmp/…, the scratchpad, \$HOME dotfiles

Deliberate non-task exception: re-run with OS_ALLOW_MAIN_EDITS=1.
