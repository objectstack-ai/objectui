 * objectui#6875 — a lookup cell in `ObjectGrid` must honour the author's
 * `displayField`, the SPEC-DECLARED spelling.
 *
 * ⭐ objectui#7155 INVERTED the second half of this pin. It used to assert
 * PARITY: both spellings resolve to the same value. That parity was the visible
 * face of a two-dialect seam — `@objectstack/spec` declared camelCase and
 * refused snake_case, while `@object-ui/types`' widget metadata declared
 * snake_case and refused camelCase, and the read chains served both with the
 * snake leg FIRST. The maintainer ruled to converge the contracts on the spec's
 * spelling in one payment, so the snake leg is gone from the chains, the
 * published type, the docs and all seven in-repo producers.
 *
 * ⇒ This file now pins the REFUSAL: a def carrying `display_field` resolves to
 * the generic name heuristic (the key is unread), and a def carrying
 * `displayField` resolves to the author's pointer. ⛔ Do not "fix" the snake
 * column back to green — that would restore the seam and make an undeclared
 * key outrank a declared one.
 *
 * ## Why this file renders a cell instead of asserting a key list
 *
 * The sibling pins in this directory (`relationalMetaCopySet-6711` /
 * `-6874`) assert what does and does not land on the `fieldMeta` bag. That is
 * the right instrument for a retirement, where nothing renders differently.
 * Here something DOES render differently, and the card was filed as a static
 * producer-vs-consumer measurement with no user report attached — so the thing
 * worth pinning is the user-visible outcome, not the copy set that causes it.
 *
 * ## The measurement this file encodes
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0's `FieldSchema` is a strict object with 71 props.
 * It declares `displayField`, `descriptionField`, `lookupColumns`,
 * `lookupFilters` and `reference`. It declares NONE of `display_field`,
 * `description_field`, `lookup_columns`, `reference_to`, `reference_field` —
 * those parse to `unrecognized_keys`, the same code a nonsense key gets, so no
 * spec-compliant producer can ship one. Measured on the installed package, with
 * `name`/`type`/`label` as the positive control.
 *
 * Nothing renames them on the way in either: `ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema`
 * (`@object-ui/data-objectstack`) is the choke point every schema read goes
 * through, and its only key rewrite is `normalizeSchemaReferenceKeys` — a
 * legacy `reference_to` folded onto `reference`, nothing else (it stamped the
 * pair both ways until objectui#11070 round 4). `applyFieldWidgetOverrides`
 * adds `widget` and touches no other key.
 *
 * ⇒ On a live path the ONLY display-field spelling that can reach this grid is
 * `displayField`, and it was the one spelling `RELATIONAL_META_KEYS` did not
 * copy. The consumer — `LookupCellRenderer` in `@object-ui/fields` — reads
 * `display_field || displayField || reference_field`, so it was ready for the
 * key the whole time; the value simply never arrived.
 *
 * ## The control that makes the refusal a reading
 *
 * Two columns render from ONE data source, ONE referenced record and ONE cell
 * renderer, differing only in the spelling on the field def:
 *
 *   `code_camel` → `{ displayField: 'project_code' }`   (spec-declared, READ)
 *   `code_snake` → `{ display_field: 'project_code' }`  (retired, UNREAD)
 *
 * ⚠️ The roles have swapped. The CAMEL column is now the positive control: it
 * must resolve `ACME-42`, which proves the lookup path is reached and the
 * resolver is returning a value at all. Without it, "the snake column does not
 * show `ACME-42`" would be satisfied by a fixture that never rendered a lookup
 * — the exact failure this file's original control existed to rule out.
 *
 * And the snake column's refusal is asserted POSITIVELY, by what it resolves TO
 * (`Wrong Name`, the referenced record's `name` via the generic heuristic), not
 * merely by the absence of `ACME-42`. A cell that rendered nothing at all would
 * pass an absence-only assertion; it fails this one.
