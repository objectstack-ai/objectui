/**
 * Registry entry point for `<ListView>` — two bridges in one component.
 *
 * ## 1. The data-source ADAPTER (#3144)
 *
 * `ListView` reads `props.dataSource` (the injected adapter), and
 * `SchemaRenderer` never passes it — it only puts the data source on
 * `SchemaRendererContext`. Registering the component bare meant that on the
 * registry/SDUI path (a metadata page, a `kind:'react'` page, the designer
 * preview) it received no data source at all: its `getObjectSchema` effect
 * returned immediately, nothing was ever fetched, and it rendered the "Nothing
 * here" empty state — while its registry `inputs` declared `objectName`
 * **required**. The app never showed this because the console reaches ListView
 * through `ObjectView`'s `renderListView` render-prop, which passes a data
 * source itself. That is the objectstack#4413 shape (a declared binding nothing
 * can consume), caught by
 * `apps/console/src/__tests__/public-block-binding-reach.test.tsx` rather than by
 * hand. `object-form`, `object-kanban` and `object-calendar` carry the same
 * one-line bridge.
 *
 * An explicit `dataSource` prop still wins — hosts that pass their own (as
 * `ObjectView` does) are unaffected. `useContext` rather than
 * `useSchemaContext()` because the latter throws outside a provider, and a bare
 * `<ListView>` with a host-supplied data source must keep working.
 *
 * ## 2. The spec's per-element data BINDING (objectstack#5576)
 *
 * `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` — `{ object, view?, filter?, sort?, limit? }` —
 * is how a page component declares what to query. It was published and unread:
 * `resolveElementDataSource` dropped `view`, had no caller outside its own test,
 * and nothing mapped `object` onto `objectName`. Worse, the binding and the
 * adapter above collide by NAME, so a page that wrote the binding the spec
 * documents got the plain `{ object, view }` object where the adapter belongs:
 * the first `dataSource.find(…)` threw `dataSource.find is not a function` and
 * the list rendered **"Couldn't load records"**. Three `list-view` components on
 * one home page, the two without `dataSource` fine and the spec-compliant one
 * broken, is the single-variable reproduction in the issue.
 *
 * `SchemaRenderer` no longer spreads the schema's `dataSource` as a prop, which
 * removes the collision at its source. This component completes the other half:
 * it maps the binding onto the props `ListView` actually reads, resolving a named
 * saved view through `ElementDataSourceGate`.
 *
 * ### Where the precedence table lives (objectui#4038)
 *
 * It is NOT here. objectstack#5576 landed this block's own ~45-line copy of
 * "binding overrides the component key / a view is only a baseline / `filter`
 * AND-combines / an empty `columns` counts as unauthored / the row cap lands on
 * `pagination.pageSize` / `viewType` only when undeclared", and objectstack#6953
 * then lifted that same table into `@object-ui/react` when the other eight
 * object-bound blocks needed it. Two copies of one table is how the spec's
 * "*additional* filter criteria" quietly becomes two dialects — the next person
 * to change the rules changes one side. So the table now lives ONCE, in
 * {@link ElementDataSourceGate}, and this block contributes only the part that is
 * genuinely its own: {@link LIST_VIEW_DATA_SOURCE}, the names of the keys it
 * reads. The behaviour is unchanged in both directions — that objectstack#5576's
 * whole suite passes here untouched is the acceptance criterion of the
 * convergence, not a happy accident.
 *
 * An unresolvable `view` still fails loudly (the gate renders the configuration
 * error rather than falling back to the object's default view): silently widening
 * a named view to "all records" is the failure class the binding exists to
 * remove, and the one an AI-authored page hides best.
