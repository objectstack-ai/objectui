/**
 * An action renderer must forward every authored key the runtime will read —
 * and must write those keys somewhere the compiler will still check them.
 *
 * Two halves, two different failures. The first is a key DROPPED from a forward
 * whitelist (below). The second is a key INVENTED at a forward site and absorbed
 * in silence, because the literal it was written into is one TypeScript does not
 * excess-property check — objectui#4281, see section 4. A surface can pass the
 * first and fail the second: two of the four action renderers did.
 *
 * The failure class (objectui#4050, carried from objectstack#6975): each action
 * renderer hands the `ActionRunner` an explicit key WHITELIST rather than the
 * action itself. That is deliberate — a key no renderer honours must not look
 * wired — but its cost is that a NEW key stays invisible until five separate
 * lists are edited, and **nothing fails while they are not**. The key parses,
 * publishes, and reads as honoured:
 *
 *   bodyExtra    objectstack#6837, objectui PR #3924 — payload dropped one hop
 *                before the runner; the action POSTed nothing.
 *   bodyShape    objectstack#6938, objectui PR #3932 — a declared
 *                `{ wrap: 'data' }` sent a flat body.
 *   resultDialog objectui#3646 — the one-shot reveal (2FA code, fresh OAuth
 *                secret) fell back to a toast and the value was lost.
 *   openIn / locations / undoable — each carries an in-comment note at its
 *                forward site recording its own instance.
 *   label / description  objectui#4192 — `action:menu`'s param dialog titled
 *                itself "Action parameters" instead of naming the action. THIS
 *                gate found the same omission on `action:icon` and
 *                `action:group`, which #4192 had not measured.
 *
 * Six of the seven were found by a human reading the lists side by side. This
 * is the gate that reads them instead (maintainer ruling, objectui#4050,
 * 2026-08-10: "Diff each action renderer's forward whitelist against the keys
 * the runtime actually reads … A new spec action key missing from a whitelist
 * must be a red check, not a silent drop; extraction failure is red, never a
 * silent pass").
 *
 * ── Why this is derivable, when objectstack#6975 argued it was not ───────────
 * #6975 stalled on one half of the diff: "the keys the runtime reads" is not
 * mechanically derivable, because `git grep 'action\.'` over the runner and the
 * console handlers returns `action.name` / `action.api` / `action.method` hits
 * with no way to separate "body-path key a renderer must forward" from
 * "mechanic the runner resolves itself". That is true OF GREP. Two changes make
 * it derivable:
 *
 *   1. Read the sites with the compiler API, not with grep — property accesses
 *      and destructurings bound to the ActionDef parameter, per file. `grep`
 *      cannot tell `action.locations` (read off the AUTHORED list, to decide
 *      which actions render) from `action.target` (read off the FORWARDED def,
 *      at execute time); binding-scoped AST extraction can, because they are
 *      different bindings in different functions.
 *   2. INTERSECT that with what the surface may be AUTHORED with. A key the
 *      runtime reads but no author can write is a runner mechanic (`api`,
 *      `chain`, `actionType`, `navigate`) and is nobody's to forward. A key the
 *      author can write AND the runtime reads is exactly the forwardable set.
 *
 *   owed(surface) = authorable(surface) ∩ runtime-read − retired
 *
 * Both inputs come from their real declarations, so neither can be a stale hand
 * copy: `authorable` from `@objectstack/spec`'s own zod shapes plus (for
 * declared surfaces) `@object-ui/types`' renderer VIEW of an action, and
 * `runtime-read` from the consumers' ASTs.
 *
 * The surface-class split #6975 flagged — `element:button` deliberately omits
 * `bodyShape` because its contract is spec's `InlineActionSchema` pick list,
 * not `ActionSchema` — is therefore DERIVED here rather than registered: an
 * inline surface gets an inline owed set, so it is green without an exemption.
 * That is one fewer hand-maintained list than #6975 feared this gate would need.
 *
 * ── The justified-omission registry ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * What is left over is real: some omissions are load-bearing and CORRECT, and
 * #6975's objection to a mechanical diff was precisely that it would report
 * them. Two things cannot be read off an AST:
 *
 *   - REACHABILITY UNDER A GUARD. `recordIdParam`, `recordIdField` and
 *     `undoable` are each read only inside `if (rowRecord && …)`, and
 *     `rowRecord` is `params._rowRecord` — written ONLY by the spread-based
 *     hosts, never by these five renderers. The keys are unreachable here, not
 *     dropped.
 *   - CONSUMPTION AT THE RENDERER. `disabled` is evaluated by each renderer to
 *     grey its own control, and `onClick` is invoked by `action:menu` directly.
 *     A key the renderer itself honours is not one it owes the runner.
 *
 * So {@link JUSTIFIED} is the declared table for those, one entry per
 * (surface, key), each carrying the evidence that made the call — the same
 * governance as `check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs`'s ALLOW: declared, reasoned,
 * and RATCHETED. An entry that excuses nothing (the key became owed-and-
 * forwarded, or stopped being owed) fails this guard, so the table cannot
 * outlive the code it excuses — which is the answer to #6975's "the registry is
 * itself the drift-prone list, one level up".
 *
 * {@link KNOWN_GAPS} is the other half, and the distinction matters: a
 * JUSTIFIED entry says "correctly omitted", a KNOWN_GAPS entry says "really
 * dropped, filed, not fixed here". Same ratchet, same shrink-only rule as
 * `check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs`'s DEBT map, and for the same reason — this
 * gate exists to stop the BLEEDING (a new key missing from a whitelist fails on
 * the PR that adds it), not to retro-fix every pre-existing drop at once.
 *
 * ── Direction ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One-way, deliberately: `owed − forwarded − excused = ∅`. Forwarding a key
 * nothing reads is not an error here. It is harmless at runtime (the runner
 * ignores it), and the opposite rule would fail every renderer that forwards a
 * key defensively — `locations`, for one, which is read only off the AUTHORED
 * action by the hosts that decide placement, never off the forwarded def.
 *
 * ── Shape ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Exported pure functions over an injectable `root`, with the CLI half behind
 * `invokedDirectly` — the same shape as `check-control-bytes.mjs` and
 * `check-changeset-presence.mjs`, and for the same reason: a gate whose failure
 * paths nothing exercises is the objectui#4690 anti-pattern one level up. Every
 * red below is driven from a synthetic repo in
 * `scripts/__tests__/check-action-forward-parity.test.ts`.
 *
 * Extraction failures THROW {@link ExtractionError} rather than returning a
 * verdict: a gate that cannot read its inputs has no verdict to give, and
 * returning "no errors" there would be the silent pass the ruling forbids.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-action-forward-parity.mjs
 * Exit: 0 = every surface forwards what it owes, into a literal the compiler
 *       checks; 1 = a key is dropped, a forward literal is unchecked, an entry
 *       is stale, or extraction failed.

// ── 4. Is the forward literal CHECKED at all? ────────────────────────────────
// Parity is only half the guarantee. The other half is objectui#4046, which
// closed `ActionDef` so that an invented or misspelled key at a forward site is
// a `TS2353` — the objectstack#2169 "Mark Done does nothing" shape, caught by
// the compiler instead of by a user. objectui#4281 measured that the guarantee
// held at only two of the four action renderers: `action:group` and
// `action:menu` rejected an invented key, `action:button` and `action:icon`
// absorbed it in silence, and NOTHING said so. A reader who knows `ActionDef` is
// closed would reasonably assume it is closed everywhere.
//
// The cause is not the type. TypeScript runs the excess-property ("freshness")
// check only on an object literal it can see whole, and several ordinary shapes
// switch it off. Measured on TypeScript 6.0.3, against `packages/components`
// itself and against a minimal reproduction (objectui#4281):
//
//   spread of an `any`-typed value    → check OFF   ← the live defect
//   `expr as T` (any T, incl. `any`)  → check OFF
//   a spread SOURCE's own keys        → check OFF   ← probe Q, the second hole
//   plain `const x = {…}`, unannotated→ check OFF
//   `const x: ActionDef = {…}`        → check ON
//   `{…} satisfies ActionDef`         → check ON
//   spread of `Record<string, any>`   → check ON
//   spread of a resolvable literal    → check ON
//
// The two broken renderers were the two that spread `localContext`, and that
// binding is `any` — `PropsWithoutRef` collapses a props interface carrying
// `[key: string]: any` to a pure index-signature type, so every destructured
// prop arrives as `any`. Note what this means: `...paramsPayload`, which
// objectui#4281's own table named as `action:button`'s culprit, is NOT one —
// narrowing only the `localContext` spread restored the check with
// `...paramsPayload` untouched.
//
// ── Why this gate states a STRICTER rule than TypeScript's ───────────────────
// Every row above turns on a TYPE, and this gate has no type checker: it parses
// source files, deliberately (see the header — a program-wide check here would
// be slower than the compile it duplicates). So the rule below is a SUFFICIENT
// STRUCTURAL CONDITION, not a restatement of the compiler's:
//
//   Every object literal contributing an explicit key to a forward payload must
//   be (a) contextually typed — the direct `execute(…)` argument, or a binding
//   annotated `ActionDef` / `satisfies ActionDef` — and (b) free of any spread
//   this gate cannot resolve to object literals.
//
// (b) is where it is stricter: a `Record<string, any>` spread would keep the
// check, but an AST cannot tell one from an `any`. The escape is not an
// exemption — it is the one-line fix the ruling prescribes, hoisting the
// explicit keys into an annotated binding, which is checked whatever the
// composed spreads turn out to be. That the rule is conservative in this exact
// direction is the point: a future renderer written in the broken shape goes red
// on the PR that adds it, which is what turns objectui#4046's guarantee from
// "true today, by luck" into "enforced".
//
// Resolvable spreads are transparent for (b) — but their SOURCE literal is
// judged by the same rule, because a spread source's keys are not checked
// through the spread either (probe Q above: `const p = cond ? {actionParams} :
// {zzBogus}` is absorbed whole; annotating `p` rejects it).
// EMPTY, and that is the finished state: every surface in SURFACES writes its
// forward payload into a literal the compiler excess-property checks.
//
// It held one entry, `element:button` — the last unchecked forward literal,
// whose payload closed with `as any`. objectui#4321 measured what that entry
// assumed could not be done: dropping the cast type-checks clean as-is, because
// every key the literal writes is already declared on `ActionDef`. The entry's
// stated reason ("the cast is load-bearing for more than the forward literal")
// was therefore wrong on the point that mattered — the `Record<string, any>`
// PROP type is a separate contract question, and the forward literal never
// needed the cast to compile. Removed by the ratchet immediately below, exactly
// as designed: the fix made the entry excuse nothing, and the entry failed.
//
// Adding one back is a real decision, not a formality — it re-opens a surface to
// the objectstack#2169 shape. Prefer the one-line fix the rule above prescribes.
