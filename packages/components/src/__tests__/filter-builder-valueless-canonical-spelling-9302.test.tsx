/**
 * The value-input gate reads the operator through the same fold the rest of
 * this component already uses, so BOTH spellings of one value-less operator
 * draw the SAME row (objectui#9302).
 *
 * ## The one site
 *
 * `needsValueInput` did a raw `has()` against
 * `VALUELESS_FILTER_BUILDER_OPERATORS`, whose members are this builder's six
 * camelCase dropdown ids. A row carrying the spec's canonical spelling
 * (`is_null`) missed the set and was treated as value-taking, so it drew a
 * value box next to a trigger that reads `Is null` — two spellings of ONE
 * operator drawing two different rows.
 *
 * This is the same CLASS as objectui#7561 and not the same site: that card
 * repaired the operator trigger's identity comparison, this is the value-input
 * gate. The component already imports `normalizeFilterOperator` and already
 * folds through it in `filterValueArity` and `reconcileOperatorForField`, so
 * the repair is one more site joining a fold this file already performs.
 *
 * ## What the repair deliberately does NOT do (the PM ruling on this card)
 *
 *   - ⛔ the EXPORTED set is not widened. Its stated job is *which rows this
 *     builder leaves value-less* — a fact about the dropdown's own six ids —
 *     and two other layers read it: `plugin-list`'s `convertFilterGroupToAST`
 *     (what the live grid QUERIES) and `app-shell`'s
 *     `foldFilterGroupToSpecRules` (what a saved view PERSISTS, documented as
 *     this set PLUS the canonical spellings only that layer sees). Widening
 *     here would make another layer's deliberate compensation redundant by
 *     side effect, in a file nobody is editing.
 *   - ⛔ no row's stored `operator` is rewritten; rendering is not an edit.
 *   - ⛔ no second spelling joins the dropdown; the emitted vocabulary is
 *     unchanged.
 *
 * ⛔ Out of scope, and untouched here: WHICH operator vocabulary wins
 * (objectui#7561's open question, filed as decision card objectui#9306). It
 * carries a hard constraint recorded on objectui#7379 — `AST_OPERATOR_MAP`
 * holds that `contains` / `icontains` "must never be folded onto" each other,
 * "That is a semantic boundary, not two spellings of one thing." The boundary
 * guard below pins that the fold this repair routes through does not cross it.
 *
 * ## DIRECTION, predicted before running
 *
 * On the unmodified tree every spelling of a value-less operator that is NOT
 * literally a member of the exported set is RED — each draws 1 value input
 * where 0 is required. ⛔ That population is not written down here: the derived
 * table below walks `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATORS` and `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATOR_ALIASES`
 * and `--reporter=verbose` names each row it measured. Writing the count down
 * is what went wrong the first time — the literal table named the canonical
 * spellings and missed the all-lowercase alias rows, which move exactly the
 * same way and had nothing pinning them — the first pass of this pin, on the
 * branch that adds it, made exactly that mistake.
 *
 * Everything else is GREEN in both directions and is carried for a named
 * reason, not for coverage:
 *
 *   - the six DROPDOWN ids draw 0 today and must keep drawing 0 — the
 *     over-reach guard. A repair that folded only one direction, or that
 *     replaced the set's members with canonical spellings, moves these;
 *   - `equals` is the FIRING CONTROL. It really does take a value and must
 *     draw exactly 1 both before and after. Without it "0 inputs everywhere"
 *     and a broken renderer are the same reading;
 *   - `exists` / `notExists` are builder-only ids with no canonical twin in
 *     the spec's vocabulary, so the fold returns them verbatim. They pin that
 *     routing the lookup through the fold did not drop the two members that
 *     have nothing to fold to.
