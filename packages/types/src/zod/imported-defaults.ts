/**
 * THE IMPORT BOUNDARY — **this mirror authors no default, imported subschemas
 * included** (objectui#8317, director ruling, decision batch #90, 2026-09-08,
 * under the maintainer's standing delegation).
 *
 * Decision batch #69 (objectui#7735) ruled a principle, not two rows: *a
 * validator validates; it does not write values into an author's document.*
 * PR #8299 delivered it for the 41 `.default()` call sites written in this
 * repository's own mirrors, and stopped there — the ruling's named scope could
 * not reach a default this repository never wrote. Measured after that landing,
 * **57 `ZodDefault` nodes were still reachable from the published
 * `@object-ui/types/zod` barrel**, every one inside a subschema imported by
 * reference from `@objectstack/spec`. So `safeValidateSchema` went on
 * substituting on those keys: an author who wrote `navigation: {}` got back
 * `navigation: { mode, preventNavigation, openNewTab, size }` — four keys they
 * did not write — and the "one authored document, two shapes" defect
 * objectui#7735 was opened about survived there.
 *
 * Batch #90 ruled option A: the principle holds for **every** key
 * `safeValidateSchema` answers, not only the 41 this repository authored, and
 * the imported defaults are stripped **here, at the boundary where the spec
 * enters this package**. ⛔ Option B — the 1546-site spec-side change on
 * another repository's release train — was NOT taken, and A is reversible into
 * it: every strip below becomes a no-op the day `@objectstack/spec` adopts the
 * same principle, with nothing to roll back. ⛔ Option C-unstated — 41 stripped,
 * 57 not, indistinguishable from the document — was refused as the one outcome
 * nobody defended.
 *
 * ## Why a WALK and not 57 hand-written `.removeDefault()` calls
 *
 * `.removeDefault()` is the established local pattern (`objectql.zod.ts`'s
 * `ViewKindEnum`, `views.zod.ts`'s `SpecListViewTypeEnum`) and it is what runs
 * below — but it only reaches a default sitting at the TOP of a member's
 * wrapper chain. Of the 57, four are at that depth; the rest are nested inside
 * imported subtrees (`page.interfaceConfig.*`, dashboard `chartConfig.*`,
 * `kanban.grouping.fields[].*`), where reaching one by hand means restating the
 * spec's own object locally. That is the "narrower than the contract it
 * implements" shape this directory already records twice, and it is how a
 * mirror silently stops being a mirror. Walking the graph instead keeps every
 * key, every type and every check exactly as the spec declares them, and
 * removes only the substitution.
 *
 * ## The accept set does not move, and that is load-bearing
 *
 * `.default(v)` carries optionality as well as a value: a member spelled
 * `.default(v)` with no `.optional()` is omissible BECAUSE of the default, and
 * a naive unwrap makes it REQUIRED — a silent accept-set narrowing on a
 * published surface, which this ruling did not authorise. So the `default` arm
 * below re-optionalises whatever `.removeDefault()` hands back, unless it is
 * already optional. `__tests__/imported-defaults-8317.test.ts` re-derives that
 * as a live differential over the repository's own document corpus rather than
 * trusting this paragraph.
 *
 * ## Why objects are CLONED and not rebuilt
 *
 * Every node is cloned by patching a copy of its own `_zod.def` and calling its
 * own constructor. ⛔ Never rebuild one with `z.object(shape)`: that spelling
 * keeps the shape and DROPS `def.checks`, so every `.refine()` and
 * `.superRefine()` the spec installed on the way down is silently lost and this
 * package would accept documents the spec refuses. Sibling precedent, and the
 * file this walker is modelled on: `../strict-authoring-face.ts`.
 *
 * ⛔ The input is never mutated. `@objectstack/spec`'s own exports are shared
 * with every other consumer in the workspace; this module derives and returns a
 * new graph, and leaves the spec's objects exactly as it found them.

 * through `_zod.parent`, which only zod's own `clone()` sets. So any node this

 * hands back an inner node that never had the outer's description to begin with.
 * Both are the same silent loss, and this is the one place that repairs it.
 *
 * ⛔ `.describe()` and not a write to `_zod.parent`: it CLONES, so the derived

 * Poking `parent` there would mutate the spec's shared graph, which the header's

 * ⛔ The description and nothing else. `z.globalRegistry.get(...)` would also
 * hand back `id`, and re-registering an `id` rewrites the registry's `_idmap`
 * entry to point at THIS package's derivation — a mutation of shared global
 * state, off a surface that promises it mutates nothing.

 * that a key the author omitted stays omitted in `parse` output instead of
 * being written for them. The input is left untouched.
 *
 * ⚠️ "the same descriptions" is carried deliberately and is not free — see
 * `withDescriptionOf`. A description is registry state keyed by the node, so
 * every derivation here has to re-attach it explicitly (objectui#9034).
 *
 * ⚠️ A schema that HAD a default in it is not reference-equal to the spec's
 * afterwards: a mirror member re-exporting one of these re-exports this
 * package's derivation, not the spec object itself. That is exactly what batch
 * #90 ruled. A schema with nothing to strip comes back REFERENCE-EQUAL — see
 * the identity property in the walker — so applying this at a crossing that is
 * already clean changes nothing at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ Memoised across every call, so writing this at each crossing costs one
 * walk per spec schema, not one per call site. `stripImportedDefaults(X)` is
 * the SAME object every time, which is what lets the mirrors spell it inline
 * instead of parking it in a local `const` — and inline is required, not
 * stylistic: `check:spec-symbols` reads exactly one hop, so a mirror export
 * under a spec-owned name has to show the spec binding in its own initializer.
 *
 * ⚠️ The STATIC type is deliberately unchanged — strictly, `T` in and `T` out —
 * following `../strict-authoring-face.ts`, whose derivation makes the same
 * choice for the same reason: this is a property of the PARSE, not of the
 * declaration, and the TypeScript twins in `../*.ts` are hand-written and
 * already declare these keys omissible. The one consequence worth naming, since
 * it bites silently: on a member that HAD a default, `.removeDefault()` still
 * TYPECHECKS against the unchanged static type and THROWS at runtime, because
 * the node there is now a `ZodOptional`. Derive a value vocabulary off the
 * `Imported…` binding instead (`views.zod.ts`'s `SpecListViewTypeEnum`).
 *
