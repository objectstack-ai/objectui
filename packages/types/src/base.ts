   * (objectui#4580, revised Q1 ruling — option A), because that is what a spec
   * producer already writes into this slot: `bridgeListView` assigns
   * `node.label = spec.label` at
   * `packages/react/src/spec-bridge/bridges/list-view.ts:180`, and `ListView`'s

   * that assignment was a type error the moment `SchemaNode` stopped being
   * core's index-signature interface — the defect this widening resolves, not a
   * capability being invented here.
   *
   * ## Which vocabulary this is, and who resolves it
   *
   * This slot — and {@link BaseSchema.description} two lines down — carries the
   * spec's INLINE form: `I18nLabel` = `string | Record<string, string>`, a
   * locale MAP like `{ en: 'Owner', 'zh-CN': '负责人' }`, resolved against a
   * BCP-47 locale by the spec's own `resolveI18nLabel(label, locale)` from
   * `@objectstack/spec/ui`. Its documented fallback order is exact match →
   * base/region (`zh-CN` ↔ `zh`) → last resort (any remaining entry), and it
   * returns `undefined` when nothing matched, so read sites pair it with
   * `?? someDefault`.
   *
   * ⚠️ {@link BaseSchema.ariaLabel}, two properties below, carries the OTHER
   * vocabulary — the KEYED form {@link KeyedI18nLabel} (`{ key, defaultValue?,
   * params? }`), a reference INTO a translation bundle, resolved by
   * `resolveKeyedI18nLabel`. One interface now carries both, two properties
   * apart, and they are structurally confusable: a keyed ref typed into this
   * slot is accepted only *vacuously*, as a locale map whose "locales" are
   * named `key` and `defaultValue`. That is objectui#4167's hazard, inherent to
   * the spec's `I18nLabel` design and present on every spec surface using it;
   * naming both shapes with cross-referenced docs is the accepted mitigation
   * (#4580's revised Q1 ruling states this cost and accepts it).
   *
   * ## Resolution happens at READ time, not at the bridge
   *
   * The renderer resolves this against the display locale — `useDisplayLocale()`
   * where the read site is in an i18n-reachable package, a locale threaded
   * through props/context where it is not (`packages/layout` carries no i18n
   * dependency). Resolving at the spec bridge was ruled out and measured
   * unimplementable in PR #4603: the bridge is a plain class method that cannot
   * call a hook, `BridgeContext` declares no locale, and `updateContext()` has
   * zero callers — so a bridge-resolved label would freeze one audience's
   * language into the node tree with no re-translation channel, the defect the
   * spec's own resolver doc records as #6761.
   *
   * @example "Submit"
   * @example { en: 'Submit', 'zh-CN': '提交' }

   * `PredicateScopeProvider` — the channel app-shell's `ExpressionProvider`
   * already feeds — and ⛔ not against the injected `DataSource` adapter
   * (objectui#9308, maintainer ruling 2026-09-13 option B). An adapter answers
   * no member a `bind` path names, so the old walk resolved `undefined` for
   * every conformant host and each reader below ran its fallback.

   * { "type": "list", "bind": "customerNames" }   // → scope.customerNames
   * { "type": "object-kanban", "bind": "app.settings.users" }
   * ```
   *
   * ## Why it is declared HERE and not on each reader (objectui#6357)
   *
   * `bind` was read by ten production sites and declared by NO schema shape —
   * it rode `BaseSchema`'s index signature as `any`, while three separate
   * documents taught it as an authorable key of EVERY node: this repo's own
   * `AGENTS.md` §4 ("Every node in the UI tree follows this shape
   * (`@object-ui/types`)" — `bind?: string`), the published agent-facing
   * `skills/objectui/rules/protocol.md` ("Every UI component node MUST follow
   * this shape"), and `content/docs/fields/grid.mdx`.
   *
   * Per-component declaration was measured and rejected: it costs nine copies
   * of one key and buys NOTHING extra, because neither half can refuse the key
   * on a non-reader either way (see the ceiling below). The class had already
   * generated FOUR local declarations before this one existed — three spelled
   * `string`, one spelled `unknown` — which is exactly the "two copies of one
   * key list is how a list becomes two disagreeing lists" hazard that
   * `plugin-dashboard/src/schemaHostProps.ts`'s own header warns about. Only
   * one of the four was a true duplicate of a base member (`ObjectPivotTable`'s,
   * removed with this card); the other three are load-bearing because their
   * containing types never reference `BaseSchema` at all, and that disconnection
   * is objectui#5155 / objectui#6269's defect, not this card's. They are held as
   * a ratchet in `__tests__/base-bind-declared.test.ts`.
   *
   * Precedent for a cross-cutting key honoured by a SUBSET living here:
   * {@link BaseSchema.placeholder}, declared for every node and read only by
   * input components.
   *
   * ## Readers, and the one documented silent failure
   *
   * Only a component that calls `useDataScope` honours it. Measured readers:
   * `list` and `tree-view` (`@object-ui/components`), and the `object-*`
   * widgets in `plugin-charts` / `plugin-dashboard` (×2) / `plugin-grid` /
   * `plugin-kanban` / `plugin-list` / `plugin-timeline`. ⚠️ `data-table` does
   * NOT: a `bind` on it is ignored and the table renders its header over an
   * empty body, with no error and no warning (`protocol.md`, and pinned in
   * `components/src/__tests__/skill-guide-data-table-binding.test.tsx`).
   * Declaring the key here does not change that, and does not bless it — the
   * key was already accepted on every node before this declaration existed.
   *
   * ## What declaring it buys, and what it does not (objectui#5155 / #6269)
   *
   * Same ceiling as the gantt and timeline pins. `BaseSchema` carries an index
   * signature on the TS side and is `.passthrough()` on the zod side, so an
   * UNDECLARED key is still accepted by both halves — this did NOT buy
   * rejection of a misspelling such as `bindTo`. What it DOES buy is the VALUE:
   * `bind: 42` type-checked and parsed green before this declaration and is
   * refused by both halves now. That narrowing only refuses what already
   * crashed — `useDataScope` is `(path?: string)` and resolves via
   * `path.split('.')`, so a non-string `bind` threw a TypeError at render.
   *
   * @example "customerNames"
   * @example "app.settings.users"

   * `(condition: string | boolean | undefined, ...) => boolean`. The sibling
   * key `hiddenOn` is `string` for the same reason, and its existence was NOT
   * taken to mean this key should stay boolean -- exactly as it was not taken
   * that way for `visibleWhen` / `visibleOn` beside `visible`, or `disabledOn`

  /**

   * contract is a union (objectui#3832).
   *
   * The array form exists because a spec key is often a union while this field
   * used to be a single kind, so a declaration had to pick one arm and the
   * repo's own manifest gate then reported the other arm's legal values:
   * `sdui-parser`'s `checkType` warned `type-mismatch` on the inline
   * translation maps (`{ en, "zh-CN" }`) that the very same inputs' own
   * `description` teaches an author to write. One platform authority
   * contradicting itself on the write it just recommended, at warning severity
   * — which is worse than it sounds, because noise on legal writes trains
   * authors (AI authors included) to dismiss the `unknown-prop` and
   * `type-mismatch` reports that ARE real.
   *
   * Semantics of the array form: the arms are alternatives, and a value passes
   * validation when ANY arm accepts it. That is the only leniency — a value
   * matching none of the declared arms is still reported, so a union is not a
   * way to opt out of the gate. Declare only arms the contract accepts AND the
   * renderer resolves; an arm the renderer drops advertises a shape that never
   * reaches the screen. `element:record_picker.emptyText` was held at a single
   * `'string'` arm for exactly that reason until objectui#5590 taught its render
   * site to resolve the inline locale map, and the second arm was declared in
   * that same change — which is the order this rule prescribes, not an
   * exception to it.
   *
   * The single-kind form stays valid and unchanged, and it is the canonical
   * spelling for a key with one arm: the manifest serializer collapses a
   * one-element array back to the bare string, so the published
   * `sdui.manifest.json` gains arrays only where a union was really declared.
   *
   * ## The arms are COARSE KINDS — and that is the ceiling (objectui#5006)
   *
   * An arm names a value's *kind*, never its *domain*. `'number'` is the only
   * numeric arm and `ComponentInput` has no `integer` / `min` / `max` slot to
   * pair with it, so a key whose contract is narrower than "some number" has
   * no way to say so here. Worked example — `page:header.maxVisible`, whose
   * spec type is a POSITIVE SAFE INTEGER: `@objectstack/spec` rejects `0`,
   * `-1` and `1.5`, while this declaration's `'number'` arm admits all three
   * and `checkType` raises no diagnostic on any of them.
   *
   * **Ruled (maintainer, 2026-08-17): the coarse arm plus `description` IS the
   * publication face's expression ceiling today, and SPEC IS THE SOLE JUDGE OF
   * VALUES.** So spell the domain out in `description`, in the author's own
   * terms ("A positive integer — the contract rejects 0 and fractional
   * values"), and let `os validate` / `os build` be the gate that enforces it.
   * `description` documents, it does not check: objectui deliberately raises
   * no authoring-time diagnostic on an out-of-domain value. A *renderer*
   * reading such a key should therefore agree with spec rather than tolerate
   * what spec rejects — `page:header`'s `readMax` was tightened to exactly the
   * contract for this reason, so the loosest layer stops deciding behaviour.
   *
   * Two directions were **deferred**, not rejected on merit: giving
   * `ComponentInput` real constraint slots (two sources of truth, free to
   * drift), and binding `checkType` to spec's Zod member when a
   * `ComponentPropsMap` entry exists (one truth, but couples `sdui-parser` to
   * spec). The ruling names the reopen condition: **a measured case of an
   * author — human or agent — shipping a spec-rejected value that objectui's
   * silence let through.** Until that is measured, do not widen this field.
   *

  /**
   * The coarse kind(s) of this input's MEMBERS — one level down from `type`
   * (objectui#8067).
   *
   * Meaningful on an input whose `type` declares `array` or `object`, and it
   * means the same thing on each: the ELEMENTS of the array, and the VALUES of
   * an object used as a MAP. One kind, or an array of them for a member
   * contract that is a union, with exactly `type`'s semantics — a member passes
   * when ANY declared arm accepts it, and a member matching none is reported.
   *
   * ## Why the slot exists
   *
   * `type: 'array'` says a value is a list and stops there, so a member key
   * that drifts from the contract is invisible to every layer that reads a
   * declaration. `page:header.actions` is the measured cost: `@objectstack/spec`
   * declares `z.array(z.string())` (action IDs), the renderer read the members
   * as `ActionDef` OBJECTS, and the repo-wide parity gate
   * (`apps/console/src/__tests__/registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts`) stayed
   * green for the whole life of the drift because it could only compare
   * top-level key names — the `inputs` side had nothing to compare with. What
   * finally settled it was a maintainer ruling, and even after the fix the
   * fact "these are ids" lived only in `description` PROSE. `of: 'string'` is
   * that same fact, in a form a machine reads.
   *
   * ## What it is NOT — and why the 2026-08-17 ceiling is untouched
   *
   * `of` is a KIND, exactly like `type`, and it stops one level down. It is NOT
   * a nested schema: it names no object keys, no element field types, no
   * per-member `required`. It is deliberately not called `items` / `element` /
   * `shape`, all of which promise a sub-schema this does not carry.
   *
   * It therefore adds NO value-domain slot, so the maintainer ruling quoted on
   * `type` above — "the coarse arm plus `description` IS the publication face's
   * expression ceiling today, and SPEC IS THE SOLE JUDGE OF VALUES" — stands
   * unchanged. `of` extends the one axis that ruling already blessed (a coarse
   * KIND) to the one position that had no way to state it; it does not reopen
   * the constraint slots (`min` / `max` / `step`) that ruling deferred, and it
   * is not the `integer`-style narrowing that ruling declined. `of: 'string'`
   * says the members are strings; which strings is still spec's question alone.
   *
   * ## It has readers on day one — the standard this slot had to meet
   *
   * objectui#5905 is the cautionary precedent: five `ComponentInput` keys were
   * declared and read by NOTHING, and the manifest serializer forwarded six
   * keys of which it read none. So `of` ships with three readers, all in the
   * same change that adds it:
   *
   *   1. the repo-wide parity gate compares every declared `of` arm against the
   *      member kind `ComponentPropsMap[type]` actually accepts, and reds on an
   *      arm the contract refuses — the same one-directional widening question
   *      the ARM DIRECTION asks of `type` (objectui#4971);
   *   2. `sdui-parser`'s `validateTree` reports a member whose kind fits no
   *      declared arm, at the member's own position;
   *   3. `sdui-parser`'s codegen types the generated `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts`
   *      surface from it — `string[]` rather than `unknown[]`.
   *
   * DECLARE IT ONLY WHERE THE CONTRACT FORCES ONE ANSWER. Every `of` in this
   * repository was derived by probing `ComponentPropsMap`'s member position
   * with one value of each coarse kind and taking the result only where exactly
   * ONE kind was accepted. A member contract that accepts several kinds (spec's
   * `record:highlights.fields` takes a string OR an object) is left undeclared
   * on purpose: picking one arm there would be the NARROWING this repo treats
   * as noise, and picking all of them would advertise shapes the renderer may
   * not resolve — which is per-block discipline, not a repo-wide derivation.
   *
   * @example { name: 'actions', type: 'array', of: 'string' }

   * The three keys the manifest serializer does not forward, retired together

   * established (objectui#5905): `?: never` here, so authoring one is a `tsc`
   * error at the registration site, and `retirementTombstone()` on the Zod

   * was measured and NOT taken: the mirror is a non-strict `z.object`, and on
   * the built face an undeclared key parses green and is silently STRIPPED —
   * one silent no-op traded for another.
   *
   * What was measured (re-measured on the retiring PR's merge-base, not

   * `ComponentMeta.inputs` was enumerated and none reads any of the three —
   * the serializer (`packages/sdui-parser/src/index.ts`) forwards a fixed key
   * list per input, `of` included since objectui#8067 (`name`, `type`, `of`,
   * `required`, `enum`, `binding`, `description` — `binding` among them is
   * not an authored key but the framework's, forwarded from
   * {@link InjectedComponentInput}, objectui#6950), its boundary type has no slot for these, the registry's
   * data-source seam reads `name` only, and neither the designer nor the
   * app-shell inspectors consult registry `inputs` at all. The one
   * non-test touch was a WRITE (`WidgetRegistry` copying the widget-manifest
   * values across), deleted with this retirement. A depth-1 bracket-balanced
   * census over every `inputs:` array in the repository counted the
   * authorship: `label` 908, `defaultValue` 245, `advanced` 9 — against
   * `name` 951 and `type` 951 in the same pass over the same regions, so the

 * director decision batch #69: `binding` is framework-set, not
 * author-declared).
 *
 * ## What the marker is, and who writes it
 *
 * `binding: 'object'` tells a consumer that the input names an OBJECT: the
 * manifest serializer (`packages/sdui-parser/src/index.ts`) forwards it into
 * `sdui.manifest.json`, `validateTree` records the prop as a binding site the
 * server must resolve, and the designer offers an object picker. It is
 * unrelated to `type: 'object'`, the coarse control KIND that sits one line
 * above it in the same declaration — a record-shaped value and an
 * object-naming input are two different facts, and the one writer states both.
 *
 * That writer is the framework: `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT` in
 * `@object-ui/core` (`data-scope/element-data-source.ts`), spliced into a
 * registration's `inputs` by `Registry.register` for every renderer that
 * passed through `elementDataSourceBlock()`. No registration authors the key.
 * Measured before the ruling and re-measured at the retiring PR's merge-base:
 * every `binding:` literal in `packages/`, `apps/` and `examples/` is
 * `'object'` (7 of 7), and every one of them is either that constant or a
 * fixture in `sdui-parser`'s own tests. The ruling answered the product
 * question the card asked — may an ordinary registration declare a binding
 * input? — with **no**, so `ComponentInput` refuses the key the ordinary way
 * (an excess-property `tsc` error at the registration site) and the ONE place
 * that may write it is typed by this declaration. Until objectui#6950 it was
 * typed by a hand-written inline literal and reached the `inputs` array
 * through an `as ComponentMeta` cast — a cast at the only write site is
 * exactly what would have hidden any later drift between the constant and
 * the type.
 *
 * ## Why `extends` and not the ruling's `&` sketch
 *
 * The ruling's example was `ComponentInput & { binding: 'object' }`. An
 * `interface … extends` says the same thing and is checked at ITS declaration:
 * if `ComponentInput` ever gains a `binding` member this one cannot extend
 * (a `?: never` tombstone, say), that is a TS2430 on this line, where the
 * relationship is stated — not a `never` quietly folded into a type expression
 * that only surfaces at whichever use site first trips over it. Diagnostics
 * also name `InjectedComponentInput` instead of an anonymous intersection.
 * The reopen route the ruling names — a measured need for author-declared
 * bindings, filed as a WIDENING of `ComponentInput` with the vocabulary
 * decided then — lands on the parent, and this declaration follows it.
 *
 * The vocabulary is exactly `'object'`. The serializer's boundary type once
 * also admitted `'field'`; that arm had zero writers and was retired with
 * this declaration (ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove, objectui#6950) — see
 * `RegistryConfigLike` in `packages/sdui-parser/src/index.ts`.
