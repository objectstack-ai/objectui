 * PM half-state sweeper (#7341 item 2) — REPORT-ONLY enumeration of the

 *
 * ## The standing caller (#9844)
 *
 * For most of this file's life its consumer was "a PM seat's patrol round" —
 * which is to say, nobody's calendar. A shift covering two lanes declared a
 * queue empty from memory while eight malformed claims (H2) and an unenumerated
 * backlog sat on the board; not one predicate here had fired, because nothing
 * standing ever called them. An alarm added to a script nobody runs is still
 * silence, and the transport note below explains why "some seat should run it"
 * kept not happening: the live sweep cannot run inside a PM session container
 * at all.
 *
 * So the caller is now `.github/workflows/half-state-patrol.yml` — a scheduled
 * workflow, on a runner where the transport prerequisite is met, landing the
 * result by rewriting ONE pinned anchor issue in place (edit history is the
 * archive; never a comment per run). `--format=markdown` exists for exactly
 * that consumer, and `--provenance` lets the caller stamp its own run identity
 * into a body this script otherwise renders repo-agnostically.
 *
 * What did NOT change, and must not: this stays report-only. The workflow never
 * fails a build over findings and never writes a label. The one thing it DOES
 * treat as a failure is its own non-delivery — a patrol that cannot land its
 * report is the disease, not a finding.
 *
 * ## Adopting the patrol in a sibling repo (#11217)
 *
 * The pair (this file + that workflow) is copied VERBATIM into a sibling repo;
 * the only per-repo input is one repository variable naming that repo's anchor
 * issue (`HALF_STATE_ANCHOR_ISSUE`). Each install runs on its own runner with
 * its own `GITHUB_TOKEN` and reads its own board — ⛔ no cross-repo credential
 * anywhere, which is the route ruled at grading rather than a matrix job.
 *
 * Two things make "verbatim" actually safe, and both are new: the swept repo is
 * resolved from the runner's own `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` rather than a hardcoded
 * default (`resolveSweepRepo` carries the argument), and the workflow REFUSES
 * to run with an unconfigured anchor instead of writing this repo's anchor
 * number in someone else's repo. It was measured worth doing: with three of the
 * four repos uninstalled, 37 of the fleet's 59 open `pm:blocked` cards had
 * never been swept, and 7 of objectui's 12 machine-readable blocks were
 * already expired when a human read them by hand.
 *
 * What still does NOT travel, stated so a reader does not assume it does:
 * cross-repo `Blocked-by:` targets stay unresolvable per install (each token
 * reads its own repo), so H19 reports them as UNJUDGED — accepted, and made
 * loud separately.
 *
 * ## Why report-only, and why the exit code is ALWAYS 0 on a completed sweep
 *
 * The pm-dispatch state model (.claude/skills/pm-dispatch/SKILL.md, "State
 * model") says the labels ARE the state machine, and its label discipline says
 * 「状态变更不过夜」: a label applied without its paired signal is a state no
 * sweep can interpret. Those half-states occur in practice — a card carried
 * `pm:queue` AND `pm:dispatched` simultaneously for ~14 hours (#5925's
 * 2026-08-09 correction comment); another sat dispatched with an assignee and
 * no claim for 48h+ (the #5925 stale-claim reclaim) — and today finding them
 * is a manual read of every card. This script is the mechanical enumerator.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT a gate: a half-state is a fact about a live, shared
 * board, not about the PR that happens to run CI next — failing an unrelated
 * PR over board state would punish the wrong actor (the same reasoning that
 * keeps `check:platform-checklist` out of CI, lint.yml's own note). So a
 * completed sweep exits 0 whether it found 0 or 40 violations; the findings
 * are the output, and the consumer is a PM seat's patrol round (the standby
 * posture in SKILL.md documents the invocation). Only a sweep that could not
 * run (network, auth, bad usage) exits non-zero — per #4690, "could not read
 * the input" must never look like "input is clean".
 *
 * ## The invariants (each names its protocol source)
 *
 *   H1  `pm:dispatched` with no assignee — dispatch marks a claim; a claim is
 *       assign + claim comment (state model / step 4).
 *   H2  assignee set on a pm-tracked card, but no claim comment on the thread
 *       (a comment whose body carries a "Claim:" line) — the assignee field
 *       alone cannot say WHICH session owns it (step 4; #4588). The marker is
 *       read with an OPTIONAL leading blockquote ">", because step 4's own
 *       claim template is a blockquote (SKILL.md, "> Claim: …") — the predicate
 *       used to reject the exact shape the skill tells every seat to write, and
 *       reported a correctly-claimed card as a half-state (#7488, measured on
 *       #6752). The strictness either side of that marker is deliberate and
 *       stays: the line must BEGIN with the word, so ordinary prose containing
 *       "claim" is not a claim comment.
 *   H3  `pm:queue` + `pm:dispatched` both present — reads as available to the
 *       queue view and in-flight to the lane view; neither is trustworthy
 *       (#5925 2026-08-09 correction, the measured specimen).
 *   H4  `pm:blocked` with a `Blocked-by:` line in NEITHER channel — body nor
 *       comment. The machine half of the label is that line; without it the
 *       unlock sweep can never return the card (state model, label
 *       discipline). It reads TWO channels because seats write two: the MCP
 *       body-escaping hazard (#8813) makes a body rewrite the riskier write,
 *       so the line is deliberately parked in a comment — 26 of 40 blocked
 *       cards were body-clean at the 2026-08-19 census, and a body-only read
 *       reported every one of them as having left the machine nothing. Either
 *       channel discharges the duty; the finding names both so a reader knows
 *       which one to fix (#8941, and the #9948 gauge-recalibration ruling).
 *       The line may be DECORATED in either channel — 「`Blocked-by: #9612`」
 *       is the natural markdown for a line meant to be grepped, and reading it
 *       as absent left #10063 permanently blocked in silence (#10102). H9's
 *       `Restart-when:` shares that anchor AND, since #10403, this two-channel
 *       read; the history of the closed asymmetry is stated at H9.
 *   H5  `pm:seat` sticker whose title/assignee pair is out of sync — the
 *       seat-sticker protocol makes 标题、assignee、正文 a same-write triple:
 *       a title claiming 🟢 <login> must have that login as assignee; a title
 *       claiming ⏳ vacant must have none. (Routine seats declare 🟢 Routine
 *       and are exempt from the assignee half — bots can't be assigned.)
 *   H6  `pm:seat` sticker whose body exceeds ~10 KB — the seat-post protocol
 *       bounds the live body to current state (six-section template, #7583,
 *       maintainer-accepted 2026-08-11); an oversized body means shift
 *       narration is accreting where per-card state already lives (cards,
 *       PRs, round reports). Soft report-only signal: the remedy is a
 *       takeover-style compaction (edit history is the archive), never
 *       truncation. #6019 reached ~61 KB and exceeded tool read limits
 *       before this rule existed.
 *   H7  an OPEN PULL REQUEST whose body declares `Part of #N` while ALSO
 *       carrying a closing keyword bound to that same `#N` — contradictory by
 *       construction. `Part of` is the protocol saying "merging this must NOT
 *       close the card"; a closing keyword is GitHub being told it must.
 *       GitHub wins, silently, on merge. This was the first item over PULL
 *       REQUESTS rather than issues, because the PR body is the surface where
 *       the fact is still fixable — see the next section.
 *   H8  a card's delivering PR is MERGED while the card still carries
 *       `pm:dispatched` — the merge's paired write (drop the label, re-grade
 *       the remainder) never landed (#8683). Delivery is read from merged PR
 *       bodies with H7's code-stripped extractors (`Part of #N`, or a closing
 *       keyword bound to `#N` — either way an OPEN dispatched card named by a
 *       merged PR is a half-state, whichever mechanism failed), and — for the
 *       bodies that declare NO delivery at all — from the PR's own branch name
 *       (#11036: a merged PR whose body said only `Refs #10757` left its card
 *       dispatched and unreported for ~22h in a sweep that got six other H8
 *       rows right). The precedence is deliberate and the widening's whole
 *       safety margin; `prDeliversCard` carries the argument. Live mode
 *       feeds H8 a bounded window of recently merged PRs, so it is a patrol
 *       accelerator, never an exhaustive audit: a delivery older than the
 *       window is invisible, and the finding clears when the paired write
 *       lands, not when the PR ages out.
 *       H8 is ALSO handed the open-PR list the sweep already holds (#10468):
 *       a card delivered in halves keeps `pm:dispatched` legitimately while
 *       its last half is open, and the row used to fire on every sweep until
 *       that half landed — prescribing a DESTRUCTIVE de-labelling against the
 *       most active card on the board. That case now emits a distinct quieter
 *       sentence that names both sides and says the label is correct, rather
 *       than falling silent: silence would lose the genuine #8683 case where
 *       the last half is later ABANDONED. See the predicate.
 *   H9  `pm:on-hold` without a machine-fireable `Restart-when:` line in
 *       EITHER channel — the state model (post 2026-08-16 ruling) makes the
 *       hold state legal
 *       ONLY with a machine-readable exit: `Restart-when: closed <owner/repo>#N`
 *       (fired by the same unlock scan as `Blocked-by:`, and since #10403 over
 *       the same TWO channels — body OR comment, the H4/H14 contract; a
 *       comment-parked exit fired and sat unnoticed ~2 days under the old
 *       body-only read) or a one-line executable predicate. A hold nothing can fire
 *       is indistinguishable from an abandoned card. `Restart-when: manual — …`
 *       counts as MISSING, deliberately: the protocol says a card no mechanism
 *       can revive is closed `not planned` (reason + provenance in the closing
 *       comment), so accepting a `manual` line here would hand every seat a
 *       one-word spelling that defeats the invariant this item enforces.
 *   H10 `priority:p0`, open, unassigned, and no activity past the threshold —
 *       p0 is queue-jump priority (dispatched immediately, past batch and
 *       round boundaries), so an unclaimed p0 holding still for longer than
 *       any legal round latency almost always means NO seat's scan scope
 *       covers the queue it sits in (the measured specimen: a correctly
 *       triaged p0 that sat ~36h because the label queue it was routed to had
 *       no named reader). Staleness is read from `updated_at` — an
 *       unparseable timestamp reports as a finding, never as fresh (#4690:
 *       "could not read the input" must not look like "input is clean").
 *   H11 the important-parked inventory — a card carrying an importance signal
 *       (native type `Bug`, or a `bug` / `security` / `priority:*` label)
 *       sitting in `pm:blocked` or `pm:on-hold` and open past the threshold.
 *       Maintainer concern, 2026-08-16, verbatim: 「我担心的优先的，重要的问
 *       题，比如bug 被放进 blocked 或者 on-hold 没人理会」. Distinct from H10
 *       (p0 + UNASSIGNED regardless of state): H11 is the broader
 *       importance × parked-state cross, so every triage fire prints the
 *       inventory of important cards that a parked state could otherwise
 *       hide indefinitely. Report-only like everything here — the remedy is
 *       the triage round re-checking the card's exit liveness, not a gate.
 *   H12 an OPEN, non-draft PR with auto-merge unarmed and no activity past
 *       the threshold — the orphan-landing detector (queue-steward
 *       retirement, maintainer-ruled 2026-08-16: the retired seat's one
 *       genuine gap). In this protocol a dev PR is flipped ready only at
 *       review ACCEPT, so ready = reviewed by construction; a reviewed PR
 *       that left the merge queue (or never entered it) with nobody handling
 *       it would otherwise wait silently forever. Patrol input, not a gate.
 *   H13 a card carrying `domain:*` with NO pm-state label, aged past one
 *       sweep cycle — the half-annotated shape the protocol's own
 *       single-label writes produce by design, which the triage sweep's
 *       disjunct ③ ("有 domain:* 无 pm-state") exists to heal hourly. In that
 *       shape the card is invisible to every seat's candidate query (routing
 *       landed, the state machine never did), and it is ALSO invisible to
 *       every label-scoped listing in this sweep — the shape is defined by
 *       the absence of the labels the other listings key on — so H13 is the
 *       one item that needs an UNSCOPED listing. Aged past a cycle it is a
 *       defect of the HEALING LOOP, not inventory (maintainer, 2026-08-19,
 *       verbatim: 「项目经理等分诊,但是没有切换 label,导致挂了很久。」「我
 *       刚和他说了他才处理。」— the measured specimen, its body self-declaring
 *       P0/data-integrity, sat ~26h until poked by hand). A louder line fires
 *       when the card's own title/body self-declares P0/data-integrity: for
 *       that class the emergency-triage channel (immediate triage subagent)
 *       is the mandated move, never the hourly Routine.
 *   H14 `pm:blocking` cache incoherence, in BOTH directions, read off the
 *       `Blocked-by:` reverse index this sweep already has the bodies for.
 *       `pm:blocking` is not a state a seat sets: the state model makes it a
 *       CACHE the triage sweep derives from that index (「分诊 sweep 自
 *       `Blocked-by:` 索引推导的缓存,⛔ 不手工挂」), and the lane selection
 *       order ranks it second only to `priority:p0`. A cache with a ranking
 *       consumer and no coherence check drifts in two different ways, and
 *       each lies differently: a card carrying the label that NOTHING targets
 *       is boosted past fresher work on the authority of a dependency that
 *       does not exist (worse than an absent label — it lies with authority),
 *       while a card that IS targeted and does NOT carry it is a real
 *       unblocker the selection order cannot see. Report-only, and pointedly
 *       so: the producer is the triage sweep's derivation pass, so the remedy
 *       is always a derivation that runs, never a label written from here.
 *       The index it reads is the UNION of both channels (body ∪ comment),
 *       for the same reason H4 reads both — and here the cost of reading one
 *       was measured: #9465 and #9968 were reported stale while their
 *       dependents (#9709/#9828 and #9969/#9652) stated the wait in comments.
 *       That is the 「量具错位」 the 2026-08-19 ruling on #9948 named — 「修量
 *       具而非追假 stale」 — and both shapes are regression pins now. The two
 *       directions treat an INCOMPLETE index differently on purpose: stale is
 *       a claim about absent evidence and is suspended when any gated comment
 *       fetch failed, while missing is a claim about evidence in hand and
 *       cannot be manufactured by reading more. See the predicate.
 *       Both directions were non-empty at the reading this item landed on
 *       (2026-08-19, 234 open cards, 17 `Blocked-by:` body lines): ONE stale
 *       card and FIVE missing ones, with not a single coherent pairing on the
 *       board — the cache had no reader checking it and had drifted to 0%
 *       agreement with the index it is derived from.
 *   H15 the oldest UNCLAIMED `pm:blocking` card and its age — one row, no
 *       threshold, selection-order compliance made visible (maintainer,
 *       2026-08-19: 「然后车道项目经理应该优先处理 blocking」). Where H14 asks
 *       whether the cache is TRUE, H15 asks whether anyone acted on it: a
 *       lane that keeps taking fresher picks past an unclaimed blocking card
 *       now says so on the anchor, by name. Deliberately not an alarm and
 *       deliberately unconditional — see the rationale on the predicate for
 *       why this one carries no threshold constant.
 *   H16 an OPEN, non-draft PR sitting in a MERGE CONFLICT
 *       (`mergeable_state` = `dirty`) past the threshold — the one board state
 *       no instrument here could express before it (devx incident,
 *       maintainer-approved 2026-08-19, verbatim: 「同意你的建议」). A conflict
 *       is not a red check: it starts no CI run, raises no event, and turns no
 *       check-run red, so every signal a patrol reads by proxy keeps reporting
 *       health — and when auto-merge is ARMED the PR additionally reads as
 *       "the queue is handling it" (H12's own reading, correct there and
 *       exactly wrong here). The measured specimen hung ~4h with nobody aware.
 *       The incident's lesson, verbatim: 「一个无法表达某状态的仪器,会把它报成
 *       它能表达的最近状态。」 — which is what H1–H15 were doing to this state.
 *       Two consequences shape the item. It is the only one needing a per-PR
 *       GET (`mergeable_state` is absent from the `/pulls` LIST payload and
 *       lives on the single-PR endpoint alone), taken for CANDIDATES only and
 *       never fatal to the sweep. And it deliberately does NOT read
 *       `auto_merge` in the finding-reducing direction H12 does: auto-merge
 *       does not resolve conflicts, so an armed dirty PR is the disease, not a
 *       handler. `unknown`/null readings are SKIPPED and never vouched for —
 *       GitHub computes mergeability asynchronously, so that reading is the
 *       platform saying "ask again later", not a state to name.
 *
 * ## H17 — the one item here that is NOT an invariant
 *
 *   H17 the on-hold TRIGGER-FILE INDEX — an inventory SECTION, not a
 *       predicate, and the only thing in this file that can never produce a
 *       finding. Each row is an open `pm:on-hold` card and the repo-relative
 *       files its hold comment(s) or body name as opportunistic-restart
 *       triggers. A card appearing in it is a hold in perfectly good standing;
 *       the row exists so a dispatching seat can intersect its file surface
 *       against the board's held cards by GLANCING at the anchor it already
 *       reads at the top of every round.
 *
 *       It is here because that intersection was measured NOT RUNNING (#10034,
 *       2026-08-19): across six cards the named trigger files were touched
 *       NINETEEN times and the rider was carried ZERO times. The mechanism is
 *       real and maintainer-accepted (2026-08-11), but it existed only as a
 *       remembered protocol step — in SKILL.md and in the hold comments
 *       themselves — and a written step nobody executes is worse than none,
 *       because holds are PRICED assuming it runs.
 *
 *       ⛔ Why it is NOT in `dispatch-gates.mjs`, where the intersection is
 *       actually wanted: that script runs in a seat container, whose live
 *       GitHub read is 403 — the same transport fact this file's prerequisite
 *       classifier exists to name. Building the intersection there would
 *       re-create the disease one layer down: a second mechanism that cannot
 *       execute. The patrol runs on a runner where the transport prerequisite
 *       is met, so it gathers and renders; the seat reads. No new seat-side
 *       dependency, and the behaviour closes through a surface that already
 *       has a standing caller.
 *
 *       Extraction is deterministic and refuses to guess: a closed set of
 *       anchor terms (`H17_TRIGGER_ANCHOR_TERMS`, derived from a nine-card
 *       census) plus the canonical `Restart-touch:` channel locate the clause,
 *       and every candidate token is validated against `git ls-files`.
 *       Anything unverifiable is DROPPED, so the index under-reports and never
 *       invents — a fabricated row would send a seat to intersect against a
 *       path that does not exist, and that intersection would silently never
 *       hit, which is the original defect wearing a new mask.
 *
 * ## H18 — `pm:retriage` aged past one triage cycle
 *
 *   H18 an open card carrying `pm:retriage` past the threshold — the label's
 *       own state model (maintainer ruling 2026-08-19/20, verbatim: 「同意 并
 *       存」) has it COEXIST with the card's standing `pm:*` label rather than
 *       replace it: the objecting seat applies it alongside its evidence
 *       comment, and the triage Routine — which re-judges every `pm:retriage`
 *       card each fire, high priority (SKILL.md) — is the only remover. That
 *       division of duties is H13's healing-loop shape again: a label nobody
 *       re-checks for age is the next "state nobody is watching", and without
 *       this item nothing here would say so. Aged past one cycle the row names
 *       the card and its coexisting standing `pm:*` label; `pm:retriage`
 *       present with NO such label gets its own note instead — the
 *       coexistence the state model requires is itself missing, so the
 *       disputed grading is unidentifiable (异议对象不明) from the label set
 *       alone. Age is read from `updated_at`, the same proxy H13 uses for the
 *       same reason: this sweep makes no per-card timeline fetch for the
 *       label-APPLICATION event, and every triage re-judgement (grade kept or
 *       changed) bumps `updated_at`, so a stale reading means nothing touched
 *       the card since some triage pass — which is exactly the failure this
 *       item exists to name. Report-only and NOT loud, like H14–H16: the
 *       remedy is the triage Routine's next fire, never a label written here.
 *
 * ## H19 — the question that ENDS a block
 *
 *   H19 an open `pm:blocked` card whose `Blocked-by:` target has CLOSED — the
 *       block has outlived its blocker. Two items already read that line and
 *       NEITHER expires a block: H4 asks whether the line EXISTS, H14 asks the
 *       REVERSE index (does anything target THIS card). Nothing asked whether
 *       the issue the line NAMES is still open, so an expired block sat in
 *       complete silence with a well-formed line, a correct label and no row
 *       anywhere. Two measured instances, both found by READING and neither by
 *       any gauge: a card whose comment-borne `Blocked-by:` target closed at
 *       09:03:37Z and which sat blocked ~4.5h after that, released only when a
 *       human walked the lane's dependency graph; and one whose body-borne,
 *       backtick-decorated target closed at 07:58:08Z and which was released
 *       only by a manual triage pass. Targets are read from BOTH channels
 *       through the shared decorated-directive reader — one of the two
 *       measured cards states its blocker only in a comment, so a body-only
 *       read would have seen half the evidence the item was filed on — and
 *       cross-repo targets are resolved rather than dropped (the opposite call
 *       from `buildBlockingIndex`, and both are right: the index asks which
 *       LOCAL card is waiting, H19 asks whether THAT issue is still open).
 *       Three target states, never two: a target that could not be resolved
 *       fires its own quieter row saying the liveness is UNJUDGED, because a
 *       silently dropped target reads as a healthy block forever — this item's
 *       own disease in a new mask (#4690). Report-only, and pointedly: the
 *       release is a protocol procedure with two mechanical double-checks
 *       (state model, 「放行双查」) over the card's conversion comments and its
 *       merged-PR timeline, so this row surfaces the candidate and the unlock
 *       sweep releases it — ⛔ never a label written from this script.
 *
 * ## H20 — the question that says a dispatch actually HAPPENED
 *
 *   H20 an open `pm:dispatched` card whose claim comment names a branch for
 *       which NO REMOTE REF EXISTS AT ALL, older than the lane's
 *       dispatch→first-commit baseline (`DISPATCHED_NO_REF_STALE_MINUTES`).
 *       Claiming and dispatching are two acts with a gap between them: the
 *       claim is an atom the protocol defines carefully (assign + label swap
 *       in one write, the claim comment, a race re-read) and LAUNCHING the dev
 *       is a third act outside it that nothing binds to the first two. A seat
 *       interrupted between them — a maintainer message answered, a tool
 *       error, lost context — leaves a card that is `pm:dispatched`, assigned,
 *       carrying a full claim comment naming a branch and a worktree, with no
 *       agent anywhere working it. ⭐ It is INVISIBLE FROM THE CARD: every
 *       field is correct, and only the absence of something elsewhere is
 *       wrong, which is why a skill sentence could not carry it and a row
 *       must. Measured on #8878 (2026-08-20): claim comment at ~14:05Z, the
 *       dispatch call never made, 74 minutes `pm:dispatched` with nobody on it
 *       until a patrol tick compared branch heads. Every adjacent row declines
 *       it for a reason of its own — H2 wants a MISSING claim comment and this
 *       one is complete, H4/H14 want `Blocked-by:`, H9 wants a hold, H8 wants
 *       a merged PR and nothing here ever ran — so the shape had no reader.
 *       ⛔ The key is NO REF AT ALL and never "no PR yet": a dev inside a long
 *       build legitimately has a ref and no PR for over an hour (measured
 *       repeatedly on this lane), so a PR-keyed row would fire hardest on the
 *       healthiest dev on the board. The guarantee is structural — the
 *       predicate is handed a ref state and nothing else. Three ref states,
 *       never two, exactly as H19 landed them: `exists` is healthy, `absent`
 *       fires, and an UNREADABLE probe fires its own quieter row saying the
 *       dispatch is unjudged, because a ref read dropped in silence reads as a
 *       healthy dispatch forever (#4690). ⚠️ The symptom is identical to a dev
 *       agent that DIED and the remedies are opposite (a dead agent needs a
 *       probe, an undispatched claim needs a dispatch), so the row names both
 *       readings rather than diagnosing one. Report-only like everything here:
 *       the remedy is a dispatch or a withdrawn claim, never a label written
 *       from this script.
 *   H21 an OPEN PULL REQUEST whose body binds a closing keyword to a `#N` the
 *       body never declared itself `Part of`, inside a SENTENCE that reads as
 *       not closing it ("Filed, not fixed: #10240", "out of scope: closes
 *       #N"). H7's own rationale covers this whole class while H7's predicate
 *       covers one spelling of it — H7 is bound to a `Part of #N` declaration
 *       and a body that declares `Part of` for nothing is silent by
 *       construction, however plainly it says the card stays open. Measured
 *       specimen (#10392): PR #10241 carried no `Part of` and the sentence
 *       "Filed, not fixed: #10240"; #10240 closed `completed` two seconds
 *       after that merge and read as finished until a human reopened it a day
 *       later. ⛔ The trigger is the NEGATION WINDOW and never keyword
 *       presence: 277 of the 300 most recently merged bodies carry a closing
 *       keyword bound to a number (301 matches), so a presence rule would
 *       report every correct PR in the corpus. The negation is the author's
 *       own statement of intent contradicting the instruction beside it, which
 *       is what makes accident separable from intent at all. The window is a
 *       SENTENCE, measured: widening it to the whole body turns 0 false
 *       positives into 13, all of them one legitimate fourteen-card close
 *       (#10714). Disjoint from H7 by construction — a number already declared
 *       `Part of` is H7's row and is skipped here. Report-only, and
 *       deliberately not imported by the blocking gate that reuses H7's
 *       predicate: widening the class must not silently widen a check that
 *       fails builds.
 *   H22 a CLOSED card still carrying a `pm:*` STATE label — the one item here
 *       that reads closed issues, and the reason it has to (#10688). H8's
 *       subject is a write that has not happened yet, but the card is usually
 *       closed by the same merge that discharges the PR, so whether H8 ever
 *       fired was decided by a race it normally loses: once the card closes,
 *       no run looks at it again and the duty is discharged by disappearance.
 *       Measured at filing: 129 of the 500 most recently updated closed cards
 *       carried a live `pm:` label, 118 of them `pm:dispatched`. Direction A of
 *       that card — ONE bounded closed reader, every other collector still
 *       open-only, so the race closes without widening the sweep. The window is
 *       the stated boundary and it is load-bearing here: a 2026-08-22 re-measure
 *       paged past 500 closed `pm:dispatched` carriers repo-wide, so an
 *       unbounded read would bury every other item under one-time historical
 *       residue. Recent residue is a live duty; the deep tail is a backfill
 *       question. Report-only like the rest — the remedy is a label write a
 *       seat performs, never one this script performs.
 *   H23 a SQUASH COMMIT MESSAGE on the default branch carrying `Part of #N`
 *       and a closing keyword bound to that same `#N` — H7's contradiction on
 *       the SECOND surface GitHub closes cards from, and the only item here
 *       that reads commits (#10942). Every closing-keyword reader this repo
 *       owns takes a PR body: H7 and H21 above, and the blocking gate
 *       `scripts/check-partof-closing-keyword.mjs`. GitHub's parser also acts
 *       on commit messages that land on the default branch, and this repo
 *       squash-merges, so every merged PR writes exactly one such message that
 *       nothing read. ⭐ The message is COMPOSED AT MERGE TIME from the
 *       branch's own commit messages, not from the PR body — so the
 *       contradiction can exist on `main` while every body was clean, and a
 *       body-side guard is not merely looking in the wrong place, it is
 *       looking at a text that never contained it (measured on PR #9478: body
 *       clean under H7 and under the gate, squash message carrying both).
 *       Measured 2026-08-22 over all 1,546 first-parent messages in the pinned
 *       window 2026-08-11T00:00Z…08-22T18:00Z: 270 bindings across 234
 *       messages, 6 carrying the contradiction, all 6 multi-commit branches
 *       whose squash concatenated a `Part of` trailer and a closing trailer.
 *       ⛔ The extractors run at `markdown: false` here and MUST: a commit
 *       message is not markdown, so backticks do not neutralise a keyword, and
 *       the finding sentence therefore prescribes REWORDING and never H7's
 *       backtick remedy — an author who has internalised the body remedy is
 *       exactly who will misapply it here. H21's negation window is
 *       deliberately NOT ported: it flags 0 of the 270 on this surface, because commit messages carry no
 *       `## Out of scope` register. Report-only and measure-first by ruling
 *       (2026-08-22); a blocking posture for this surface is a later card on
 *       its own baseline.
 *
 * ## H24 + H25 — the queue/assignee contradiction, and the state that closes it
 *
 *   H24 an OPEN card carrying `pm:queue` with a NON-EMPTY assignee — the queue
 *       view reads it as dispatchable, the claim rule reads it as taken, and
 *       both readers are right about the field they read, so the card is
 *       available to everyone and forbidden to everyone at once. A pure
 *       intersection of two fields: no threshold, no timestamp, no identity
 *       test. Every adjacent row declines the shape for a reason of its own —
 *       H1 wants NO assignee, H2 wants a MISSING claim comment (the measured
 *       carriers have complete ones), H3 wants two LABELS while here the
 *       second half of the contradiction is a FIELD — which is how 17 cards
 *       across three repos (2026-08-23 census: 6 objectstack, 10 objectui, 1
 *       cloud) sat in it with nothing reporting them. The measured origin is a
 *       state ROLLBACK that swaps the label and leaves the field: of the three
 *       rollback paths, only dead-claim reclamation ever named the assignee
 *       drop, so H8's and H19's remedy sentences now name it too (「同笔摘
 *       assignee」). ⚠️ The field carries two meanings — dead agent claims and
 *       genuine human ownership — and the row deliberately does NOT try to tell
 *       them apart: the ruling of 2026-08-23 puts the rule FIRST and any
 *       true-ownership exemption in an explicit marker LATER, never the other
 *       way round. It names the login instead, and states the asymmetric
 *       remedy (an agent may clear agent residue; ⛔ never a human's).
 *   H25 `pm:awaiting-maintainer` coexisting with another pm STATE label — the
 *       exclusivity half of the new state ruled in on 2026-08-23 (「可以新标
 *       签,最好 pm: 开头」). The state exists because the board had no legal
 *       place for "everything mechanical is done, a human must now act":
 *       `needs-user-decision` is the ruling inbox (the ruling here is already
 *       given) and `pm:on-hold` requires a machine-fireable `Restart-when:`
 *       (H9), which this card can never have. Each forbidden pairing is a
 *       specific lie about which mechanism will release the card, and the row
 *       names the one it found. Written while the population is zero, which is
 *       the cheapest moment to pin a vocabulary. The label also joins H11's
 *       parked inventory, H13's state vocabulary and H22's residue set, so the
 *       new state is a first-class citizen of every reader rather than a hole
 *       four rows wide. ⛔ Deferred, declared rather than dropped: the SKILL.md
 *       state-model row (its protocol face) and applying the label to the
 *       specimen card, which is a seat's write.
 *
 * ## H26 — the block whose releaser nobody is scheduled to be
 *
 *   H26 an open `pm:blocked` card whose resolvable `Blocked-by:` target is OPEN
 *       and parked in `pm:on-hold` or `needs-user-decision` — states nothing in
 *       the machinery is scheduled to leave, so the wait has NO SCHEDULED
 *       RELEASER. ⛔ NOT that such a state cannot be exited: cards measurably do
 *       close out of both, and objectui#9317 retired that claim from this row
 *       after counting them (the census is in the rationale below, dated and
 *       with its population named). The unlock predicate is "the target closed",
 *       so the release has to be WANTED by someone, and nothing schedules that
 *       wanting — which is what this row reports, and nothing reported it: the
 *       waiting card is
 *       perfectly well-formed (H4 clean, target resolves, target open, so H19
 *       clean, label correct), and H9 — the nearest neighbour — audits the HELD
 *       card rather than the waiting one. Six measured instances, all found by
 *       a human reading: two cloud cards on one hold parked since July, a third
 *       on another, and objectos's ENTIRE blocked inventory (2 of 2) waiting on
 *       its single unanswered decision card, which is also the only item in the
 *       fleet's decision inbox — one ruling clears that repo. A second leg on
 *       the same data flags a target that is itself `pm:blocked` (the wait is
 *       transitive: the measured chain was real one hop up and false two hops
 *       up, its target being an H19 finding on the same sweep) — it names the
 *       hop rather than chasing it, which would cost a request per hop and can
 *       cycle. FREE: H19 already resolves every distinct target, and a resolved
 *       target's labels rode in on a payload this sweep had already paid for.
 *       ⛔ Not a judgement that the block is wrong — waiting on a deferred card
 *       is sometimes right; the row says the wait has no SCHEDULED releaser,
 *       which is a fact a human should be handed rather than discover.
 *       Deliberately NOT reported: a target labelled `pm:queue` while titled
 *       `[Decision]` (one of the six). That is a mislabelling, not a fact in
 *       the labels, and a title heuristic would make this sweeper guess at
 *       intent.
 *
 * ## H27 — the claim is perfect and the claimant is dead
 *
 *   H27 an open `pm:dispatched` card whose claim is TEXTBOOK-CORRECT — assignee
 *       set, a first-line `Claim:` comment, a named branch that EXISTS on the
 *       remote — where that branch has not moved since the claim, no PR
 *       delivers the card, and the claim is older than the protocol's own
 *       ~24h stale line (`DEAD_CLAIM_STALE_HOURS`). This is the shape a dev
 *       agent that DIED leaves behind, and the measured cause arrives in
 *       batches: one shared-account capacity limit killed three concurrently
 *       dispatched agents at 05:50Z, leaving three cards on which every
 *       predicate in this file passed. ⭐ Its danger is not that it goes
 *       unreported but that it reads as HEALTHY: the next PM's round-open
 *       mutual-exclusion read looks for the latest non-self `Claim:` on a
 *       lane's dispatched cards, so a dead claim is read as a live claim by
 *       another session and the lane stays off the card — the protocol's own
 *       mutual-exclusion mechanism converting a corpse into a lane-wide block.
 *       H20 is the near neighbour and misses it BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by
 *       oversight: `.claude/agents/os-dev.md` makes pushing the empty branch
 *       the FIRST action of the task (a write-route probe), so a
 *       protocol-compliant agent that dies still leaves a ref and lands
 *       outside H20's no-ref-at-all population. The better the dev follows the
 *       protocol, the more invisible its death — which is why the two rows are
 *       disjoint by construction (H20 fires only when NO branch resolves, H27
 *       only when one does) and why neither could be widened into the other.
 *       ⛔ The threshold is QUOTED, not measured: the fleet has 2 liveness
 *       samples and that is not a distribution, so the row mechanizes SKILL.md's
 *       existing 死认领回收 line (「认领 >~24h」) — the same 24h the seat-post
 *       patrol already calls 「与既有回收线同一条」, one number in the protocol
 *       with two readers. ⚠️ Reporting is not reclaiming, and the row says so:
 *       the protocol's reclaim rule applies to a branch that does NOT exist and
 *       states 「有带提交活分支的认领永不回收」, so this row prescribes the
 *       three-state recovery INSPECTION (remote / container disk / gone, found
 *       work handed on flagged UNVERIFIED — `references/dispatch-runbook.md`)
 *       and never an assignee drop. It deliberately under-reports the dev that
 *       pushed one commit and then died (its branch moved after the claim), for
 *       the same reason — that is precisely the card the protocol protects.
 *
 * ## H28 — the STALE BODY LINE that shadowed the live blocker
 *
 *   H28 an open `pm:blocked` card whose BODY names a `Blocked-by:` target that
 *       has CLOSED while a COMMENT names one that is still OPEN. The body is
 *       the canonical home for the line, so this is the re-park written half:
 *       a seat found the body's upstream closed, carded the real prerequisite,
 *       wrote the NEW blocker into a comment — and left the spent one in the
 *       body. Measured: one card sat in exactly this shape while its real
 *       blocker was open and `pm:dispatched`, and it was RELEASED to `pm:queue`
 *       on the strength of the stale line.
 *       ⚠️ The mechanism half is the gate that used to sit in front of the
 *       liveness read. `needsBlockedByComments` skips a card whose body already
 *       carries a line — correct for H4, which only asks whether the line
 *       EXISTS — but H19/H26 borrowed that gathering and so resolved ONLY the
 *       stale body target, found it closed, and published "the block has
 *       outlived its blocker": a FALSE unlock candidate, on three consecutive
 *       sweeps. The liveness read is therefore UNGATED now
 *       (`needsBlockerLivenessComments`), and H4's cheap question stays cheap.
 *       Ungating alone would only turn the false candidate into a PARTIAL one,
 *       so this row is its pair: it names the stale body line as the thing to
 *       fix and asks for the live blocker to be MIGRATED to the body, enforcing
 *       the canonical-home doctrine at the moment the wrong shape is written
 *       rather than trusting a seat to remember it mid-re-park.
 *       FREE: the same resolutions H19 and H26 already hold, asked a third
 *       question — which CHANNEL each target arrived in.
 *
 * ## The close mechanism, measured (#8293)
 *
 * A half-delivered card (#8131) was closed `completed` two seconds after its
 * PR (#8277) merged, although that PR's body opened with `Part of #8131` and
 * carried an explicit warning against auto-closing it. The card was filed on
 * the hypothesis that GitHub's *development-sidebar* link closes on merge
 * "regardless of the description's wording", the keyword path having been ruled
 * out by a scan for closing keywords.
 *
 * That hypothesis is REFUTED and the scan was wrong. The PR body's own warning
 * sentence read, verbatim: "…the PM should close #8131 deliberately once #8136
 * lands." GitHub's closing-keyword parser matches `close` + `#8131` and ignores
 * every bit of the surrounding prose — the modal "should", the negation in the
 * clause before it, the whole paragraph arguing the card must stay open. The
 * sentence written to PREVENT the auto-close is what performed it.
 *
 * Four live readings pin the parser's actual shape, and each is a fixture in
 * the self-test below:
 *
 *   1. keyword + `#N` in PROSE closes it — #8277's `close #8131`: closing link
 *      created, card closed on merge.
 *   2. the SAME body's `#8136`, one clause later behind the word "once" and no
 *      keyword, got NO closing link and survived the merge untouched (it was
 *      closed deliberately 3.5 h later). Same body, same merge, opposite
 *      outcomes — which no sidebar-link hypothesis can explain, and which is
 *      the measurement that refutes it.
 *   3. `Part of #N` alone does NOT close — #8261/#8103, the same round's other
 *      partial-delivery PR, which stayed open exactly as the protocol intends.
 *      The "non-uniformity" the card flagged as its lead is fully explained by
 *      the presence or absence of a keyword; nothing else differed.
 *   4. keyword + `#N` inside INLINE CODE does NOT close — measured live on open
 *      PR #8454, whose body says "the dispatch asked for `Fixes #8284`" inside
 *      backticks while #8284 carries no closing link at all. This is why the
 *      predicate strips markdown code before scanning: without that step it
 *      flags the exact shape a careful author writes when EXPLAINING that they
 *      deliberately did not use the keyword.
 *
 *   5. keyword + `#N` inside a FENCED BLOCK does not close either — and the
 *      closing link is created at PR-OPEN time, not at merge. Both were settled
 *      by one controlled reading on 2026-08-13 (#8476 step 1). A throwaway PR
 *      (#8523, empty commit, closed unmerged) carried three arms in ONE body at
 *      one moment: `Fixes #8520` inside a fenced block, `Fixes #8521` inside an
 *      inline span, and a plain-prose `Fixes #8522`. Read seconds after that PR
 *      opened, `closed_by_pull_requests` was EMPTY on #8520 and on #8521, and
 *      carried #8523 (state OPEN) on #8522. The prose arm is the positive
 *      control that makes the two nulls readable at all: without it, "no link
 *      on the fenced arm" cannot be told apart from "closing links only
 *      materialize on merge".
 *
 * So the strip rule is a false negative in neither direction, and the merge is
 * no part of the mechanism: the contradiction exists, and is fixable, from the
 * moment a PR opens. That is what lets the same predicate back a PR-scoped
 * BLOCKING gate (`scripts/check-partof-closing-keyword.mjs`, which imports
 * `h7PartOfWithClosingKeyword` from here) as well as this report-only sweep.
 * H7 stays in the sweep regardless — patrol coverage of PRs whose CI predates
 * that gate — and nothing about this file's report-only contract changes.
 *
 * Scope of the remedy that lands HERE: this is the report-only detector, not a
 * suppression. Suppressing at source means telling authors not to put a closing
 * keyword next to another card's number, which is protocol text living outside
 * `scripts/pm/**` — deliberately left to the card that owns that text.
 *
 * The body half of H5 (the 「当前 PM」 paragraph) is NOT machine-checked here:
 * seat-sticker bodies are prose with no pinned grammar, and a fuzzy parser
 * would report phantom desyncs — the #4690 shape in mirror image. The
 * title/assignee pair is the mechanical half; the sweep prints the sticker
 * URL so the patrol reads the body itself.
 *
 * ## Transport prerequisite — MEASURED per run, never assumed (#7412)
 *
 * Live mode talks to `api.github.com` over node's global `fetch`, and that needs
 * two things this repo's agent containers do NOT uniformly provide:
 *
 *   1. a route to `api.github.com` from NODE. Node's `fetch` (undici) ignores
 *      `HTTPS_PROXY`, so it does not share the path `curl`, `gh` and the
 *      `mcp__github__*` tools take. A container where `curl https://api.github.com`
 *      answers 200 can be one where this script reaches nothing, and the reverse
 *      also occurs. `curl` is therefore NOT a valid pre-flight for this script;
 *      the probe below is.
 *   2. either NO token, or a token that really is a GitHub credential.
 *      `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` being SET does not make them GitHub tokens:
 *      in agent containers both are commonly the agent proxy's own 14-character
 *      `prox…` placeholder. Sending that as a Bearer earns a hard 401 — strictly
 *      WORSE than sending nothing, because the token fallback at `TOKEN` turns a
 *      container where anonymous access WOULD have worked into one where the
 *      sweep cannot start.
 *
 * The paragraph this replaces claimed "unauthenticated works at 60 req/h". That
 * is not a fact about this script's environment. Four container classes have
 * been measured and no two agree:
 *
 *   PM seat session (#7412 as filed) — proxy denies the host (curl 403 with and
 *       without the token), node fetch 401. GitHub access is MCP-only there, so
 *       live mode cannot run at all.
 *   Triage Routine (#7412 comment, 2026-08-11) — host reachable AND the injected
 *       `GITHUB_TOKEN` is a real credential (`/rate_limit` 200, 15000 core
 *       quota). Live mode runs fully.
 *   Cloud dev session (this change's own measurement, 2026-08-11) — node fetch
 *       reaches the host, but NEITHER identity can read the board: the token is
 *       the `prox…` placeholder (401 Bad credentials), and anonymous is 403
 *       `API rate limit exceeded for <ip>` because the 60 req/h anonymous quota
 *       is counted per EGRESS IP and was already spent by other containers
 *       behind the same NAT. Meanwhile `curl` answered 200 BOTH ways, because it
 *       honours HTTPS_PROXY and the proxy substitutes a real credential — the
 *       misleading pre-flight point 1 warns about, measured.
 *   Proxy-mediated cloud session (#9946, measured 2026-08-19) — the same
 *       container class as above, but with node routed THROUGH the agent proxy
 *       (`NODE_OPTIONS=--use-env-proxy`, which is what a seat is told to use for
 *       live GitHub reads from node). The proxy substitutes a real credential
 *       for the placeholder, so ACCOUNT-scoped endpoints answer as GitHub and
 *       the identity is genuine — while every REPO-scoped endpoint is refused by
 *       the proxy itself. Live mode cannot run, and the reading that used to say
 *       it could is the reason this probe now has a second stage.
 *
 * That fourth class is the one that broke the probe, and its mechanism is worth
 * stating exactly, because the obvious hypothesis is WRONG and was measured to
 * be wrong. `/rate_limit` there is not the proxy fabricating a quota: it carries
 * `server: github.com`, a real `x-github-request-id`, and a 15000-limit core
 * quota, and `GET /user` on the same transport returns the real login. GitHub
 * really did answer, and the credential really does authenticate. What the proxy
 * intercepts is the OTHER side — the repo-scoped reads:
 *
 *   GET /rate_limit                          -> 200, remaining 14979, server: github.com
 *   GET /user                                -> 200, the real login
 *   GET /repos/objectstack-ai/objectstack    -> 403, NO x-ratelimit-* headers,
 *                                               NO server: github.com, and a body
 *                                               from the proxy vendor, not GitHub
 *
 * So no amount of care applied to `/rate_limit` can classify this container: the
 * account-scoped observation is genuinely healthy, and is identical to the
 * Routine runner's. Only a REPO-scoped read separates them, which is why the
 * probe now takes one — and why `GET /user` would not have done: it is
 * account-scoped and answers 200 here. The discriminator is not "a real
 * endpoint", it is "the KIND of endpoint the sweep actually needs".
 *
 * Two things this fourth class deliberately does NOT do, both because the file
 * has already recorded the decision against them:
 *   - it does not pattern-match the proxy's refusal body. That body is a vendor
 *     string that can change under us, and this classifier stays narrow about
 *     what it will name (the `looksLikeStaleWorkspaceDist` posture below).
 *   - it does not read the 14-character `prox…` token shape as disqualifying.
 *     Token shape enriches wording and never gates a request — an unknown future
 *     prefix must still be SENT so GitHub gets to be the judge — and in this very
 *     class that placeholder IS swapped for a working credential, so the shape
 *     would have mispredicted the outcome in both directions.
 * What it matches instead is a pure structural contradiction, with no vendor
 * string and no shape test in it: the quota endpoint reports thousands of core
 * requests available, and a core request just got refused.
 *
 * The third class also produced the trap worth naming: `/rate_limit` is EXEMPT
 * from the limit it reports. With the quota spent it still answers 200 (carrying
 * `x-ratelimit-remaining: 0`) while every other endpoint answers 403 — so a
 * probe that reads only the status code cheerfully green-lights a sweep that
 * cannot make one request. The first draft of the probe below did exactly that.
 * `probeIsUsable` is that lesson, and the self-test pins it.
 *
 * So the script PROBES before it sweeps, in two stages, and the staging is the
 * whole cost story:
 *
 *   1. `GET /rate_limit` — costs no core quota, and is what separates the first
 *      three classes from each other (unreachable / bad credential / exhausted).
 *      Any verdict OTHER than `reachable` stops here, exactly as before.
 *   2. `GET /repos/{OWNER_REPO}` — fired ONLY when stage 1 came back
 *      `reachable`, i.e. only on the path that used to return a green. Costs
 *      one core request, accepted deliberately (#9946): a probe whose answer
 *      does not predict what the sweep can do is worth less than the request it
 *      saves, and the sweep it green-lights spends a request per label page
 *      anyway.
 *
 * Consequence worth being explicit about: the three FAILING classes cost exactly
 * what they cost before (one request, no core quota), and the healthy path costs
 * one core request more than it did. Nothing on a failing path got slower or
 * more expensive.
 *
 * A failed probe prints a classified PREREQUISITE NOT MET report naming
 * which of the two requirements is unmet and the one command that satisfies it —
 * never a sweep result. `--probe` runs that check alone, which is what a seat
 * should use to answer "can live mode run in THIS container?".
 *
 * The repo-scoped stage is an OPTIONAL observation on the pure classifier, not a
 * required one: `classifyTransportProbe` handed no `repo` reading classifies the
 * account-scoped evidence alone, exactly as it always did. That keeps the other
 * importer of this classifier (`scripts/pm/ci-failure.mjs`, which reads the
 * Actions API and gathers its own account-scoped observations) behaving
 * identically. The guarantee that THIS script never green-lights on stage 1
 * alone therefore lives in `probeTransport` / `needsRepoProbe`, which is where
 * the gathering policy belongs — and it is pinned in the self-test.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT decided here: whether these scripts should grow an MCP-backed
 * transport or a required-real-token doctrine. That depends on where
 * `scripts/pm/**` live modes are meant to execute, which is a maintainer call
 * (#7412 triage, explicitly out of scope). This change only stops the file from
 * lying about the transport it has. It does not drop, substitute or re-route the
 * token, so a container where the sweep worked before works identically after.
 *
 * REST only, never GraphQL (Operational notes 3: the loop's hot path stays on
 * the core quota).
 *
 * ## Exit codes
 *
 *   0  the sweep completed — 0 or 40 findings alike (report-only, see above).
 *   3  PREREQUISITE NOT MET — a classified transport failure. Nothing was swept,
 *      and the report says so instead of implying a clean board.
 *   2  the sweep could not run for a reason this file cannot classify. The
 *      pre-existing catch-all, kept so an unfamiliar failure stays loud (#4690).
 *
 * 2 and 3 are both non-zero, so any wrapper reading non-zero as failure behaves
 * exactly as before. The split exists so a patrol can tell "this container was
 * never able to run the live sweep" (3 — expected, go run it elsewhere) from
 * "something broke" (2 — investigate).

 * WHICH repo this sweep reads — resolved, and the resolution is the whole

 *
 * ## The trap this closes, measured
 *
 * The patrol pair (this file + `.github/workflows/half-state-patrol.yml`) is
 * installed in objectstack only, so 37 of the fleet's 59 open `pm:blocked`
 * cards had never been machine-swept, and a hand-run of H19's predicate over
 * objectui's blocked inventory found SEVEN blocks whose blocker had already
 * closed — 58% of that repo's machine-readable blocks were false, some for a
 * week. The difference was never discipline: one repo has a caller and three
 * do not.
 *
 * The fix is adoption by COPY — a sibling repo takes both files verbatim, runs
 * them with its OWN `GITHUB_TOKEN` against its own board, and writes its own
 * anchor (the route ruled at grading: per-repo installs, zero new credentials,
 * ⛔ never a matrix with a cross-repo token). And a hardcoded default is
 * exactly what makes "verbatim" unsafe: a copy of this file in objectui, run
 * with no `PM_SWEEP_REPO`, would cheerfully sweep OBJECTSTACK and write the
 * findings into objectui's anchor — a full, green, entirely wrong report, whose
 * only symptom is card numbers that do not exist in the repo reading them.
 *
 * So the resolution order is:
 *
 *   1. `PM_SWEEP_REPO` — the explicit override, unchanged, and still first: a
 *      seat pointing this at another board is a deliberate act.
 *   2. `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` — what Actions sets on every runner, i.e. the repo
 *      the workflow is INSTALLED IN. This is the line that makes a verbatim
 *      copy correct by default, and it is why the default below can never be
 *      reached on a runner.
 *   3. `DEFAULT_SWEEP_REPO` — a seat's terminal, where neither is set.
 *
 * The objectstack leg is unchanged by construction: its runner sets
 * `GITHUB_REPOSITORY=objectstack-ai/objectstack`, which is the same string the
 * hardcoded default carried, so every request path is byte-identical. The
 * workflow ALSO passes `PM_SWEEP_REPO: ${{ github.repository }}` — belt and
 * braces, and it keeps the wiring visible where a reader of the workflow looks.
 *
 * A malformed value is REFUSED rather than silently replaced by the default:
 * substituting a different board for the one the caller named is how a report
 * about the wrong repo gets written, which is the disease above. The refusal
 * happens at the CLI so that importers of this module (`ci-failure.mjs` takes
 * the transport classifier) are unaffected by a variable they never read.

// The `Blocked-by:` COMMENT channel — read by H4 and by the H14 index alike.
//
// Since #10403 the comment channel is no longer `Blocked-by:`-only: H9's
// `Restart-when:` reads it too, through its own gated fallback in the sweep
// (see the H9 section for the incident that closed the asymmetry). The two
// directives share one anchor AND one channel contract now, so "H4 tolerates
// X" and "H4 reads comments" both generalise to H9 — the boundary notes below
// apply to either directive's comment read.
//
// ## Stated boundary: no read-closure cut-off, because REST carries none
//
// The seat-post protocol's read-closure rule is 「只读晚于正文最后编辑时间的
// 评论」 — comments NEWER than the body's last edit — on the stated ground that
// 「两个时刻都是平台盖章的硬读数,比对即得」. One of those two stamps is not
// available here. A comment's `created_at` is on every row, but an ISSUE's
// body-edit time is on no REST payload at all: the issues API carries
// `created_at`/`updated_at` only, body edit history lives behind GraphQL
// `userContentEdits`, and this file is REST-only by a standing operational
// note (the loop's hot path stays on the core quota). The issue timeline
// endpoint does not record body edits either.
//
// So the cut-off is NOT implemented, rather than implemented against a proxy.
// The one proxy in reach — `updated_at` — is worse than nothing: it bumps when
// a comment is POSTED, so "newer than the body's last edit" would be false for
// every comment ever written, and the fallback would read nothing while
// looking like it read. A check that cannot fail is the shape this file exists
// to catch, not to add.
//
// Reading the whole first page instead errs in ONE direction, and it is the
// safe one. Extra evidence can only ADD `Blocked-by:` edges: it can clear an
// H4 row (the duty really was discharged, in the other channel) and it can
// clear an H14 stale row (something really is waiting), which is the
// recalibration #9948 ruled for. What it cannot do is invent a card's silence.
// The residual cost is a genuinely OBSOLETE comment edge — a line written, then
// the body rewritten to drop the dependency — which needs the source card to
// still be open, still labelled, and still body-clean; in that state the source
// card is itself mis-stated, and surfacing its edge is not the worse error.
// The seat rule's own rationale (「评论无界增长」, a token tax) does not bite
// here either: the fetch is gated to a bounded candidate set and capped at one
// page, the same trade H2, H16 and H17 make.

// DECORATED DIRECTIVE LINES — the shared anchor for `Blocked-by:` (H4, H14)
// and `Restart-when:` (H9). #10102, ruled option C on 2026-08-20.
//
// ## What the old anchors required, and the two harms that cost
//
// Both directives are machine-readable lines written by hand IN MARKDOWN, so
// authors code-format them: 「`Restart-when: …`」 is the natural spelling for a
// line whose whole purpose is that a machine greps it. The original anchors
// (`^\s*` for H9, `^[ \t]*` for H4/H14) accept only whitespace before the key,
// and a backtick is not whitespace — so a DECORATED directive read as an
// ABSENT one. Measured twice on 2026-08-20, once on each predicate, failing in
// OPPOSITE directions:
//
//   - #9591 — 「`Restart-when: the v18 major development cycle opens …`」 in
//     the body. H9 reported "no `Restart-when:` body line" against a legal,
//     maintainer-commissioned hold, and H9's own remedy text told the reading
//     seat to close it `not planned`. LOUD, and destructive if believed.
//   - #10063 — 「`Blocked-by: #9612`」 in the body. H4 reported the line absent
//     in both channels, and the unlock sweep — which greps that same literal —
//     could never have returned the card. SILENT and permanent: no row, no
//     alarm, no expiry. That half has no detection channel of its own, which
//     is why documenting the strictness (option B) was not enough.
//
// Nothing in either documented predicate ever required the line to start bare,
// and no self-test covered a decorated one: an untested gap, not deliberate
// strictness.
//
// ## What is tolerated
//
// In front of the key: indentation, ONE `-`/`*` list bullet, and any run of
// inline-code backticks or `**` bold markers. A `**` may also sit between the
// key word and its colon (`**Blocked-by**:`) or immediately after the colon
// (`**Blocked-by:**`), because that is what a bolded directive actually looks
// like; likewise a closing backtick when only the key was code-formatted
// (「`Blocked-by:` #123」). A trailing marker MATCHING one that opened the line
// is stripped off the captured value, so 「`Restart-when: closed acme/w#9`」
// yields the same value the bare line yields — the trailing backtick never
// reaches the `manual` test or the ref scan.
//
// ## What is deliberately NOT tolerated — the strictness that stays
//
//   - The KEY's spelling and case. The unlock scan greps the literal, so
//     `restart-when:` is a line the machinery cannot see and must still be
//     flagged. Decoration is about what SURROUNDS the directive; the directive
//     itself stays byte-stable. A decorated lowercase key is still a finding.
//   - A bullet needs its trailing space (`- Blocked-by:`, never
//     `-Blocked-by:`) — that space is what makes it a list bullet rather than
//     the first character of a word.
//   - The whole prefix stays anchored to the line start, so a mid-sentence
//     mention 「seats park the `Blocked-by: #1` line in comments」 is prose,
//     not a directive — the property the old anchors were really protecting.
//   - A line whose value is nothing but decoration (「`Restart-when:`」) still
//     counts as valueless. Stripping can empty a value, so the extractor drops
//     empties AFTER cleaning rather than trusting the match to be non-empty.
//
// The residual is the shape this relaxation cannot reach — a key the grep
// itself cannot see — and H9's finding text now names that possibility
// explicitly instead of prescribing a close.

 * But seats deliberately park that line in a COMMENT rather than the body —
 * the MCP body-escaping hazard (#8813) makes a body rewrite the riskier
 * write — and 26 of 40 blocked cards measured on 2026-08-19 were body-clean
 * for exactly that reason. Reading the body alone reported every one of them
 * as a card that had left the machine nothing, which is false: the duty was
 * met, in the other channel. So a comment carrying the line CLEARS H4, and the
 * finding sentence names both channels so a reader can tell which one to fix.
 *
 * ## Three input states, never two (#4690)
 *
 * `commentBodies` distinguishes them deliberately:
 *
 *   - `undefined` — the channel was not consulted (a caller reading bodies
 *     only). The sentence claims nothing about comments, and this is exactly
 *     the pre-#10061 reading, preserved rather than silently upgraded.
 *   - `null` — consulted and UNREADABLE. The row still FIRES, because going
 *     quiet here would make a transport failure shrink the patrol below where
 *     it stood before the fallback existed; the sentence says the second
 *     channel could not be read instead of asserting that it is empty.
 *   - `string[]` — read. Both channels judged, for real.
 *
 * The unreadable case fires where H14's stale direction goes QUIET on the same
 * failure, and the asymmetry is deliberate, not an inconsistency. H4's remedy
 * is "add a line" — idempotent, cheap, and harmless if a comment already had
 * one. H14-stale's remedy is "drop a label the selection order depends on" —
 * destructive, and the measured false positive this whole fallback exists to
 * end. An unreadable reading must surface on the cheap side and must never
 * drive the expensive one.

 * Blank out markdown code — fenced blocks and inline spans — so the scan sees

 * "`Fixes #8284`" in backticks and #8284 has NO closing link, so GitHub does
 * not fire inside a code span. Skipping this step would make the predicate
 * report every author who correctly explains that they did NOT use the keyword
 * — turning the guard into noise on precisely the careful PRs.
 *
 * MEASURED for fenced blocks too, as of 2026-08-13 (#8476 step 1): a throwaway
 * PR (#8523) carried `Fixes #8520` inside a fence, `Fixes #8521` inside an
 * inline span and a plain-prose `Fixes #8522` in ONE body, and seconds after it
 * opened — unmerged — `closed_by_pull_requests` was empty on the fenced and
 * inline targets while the prose target already carried the link. The prose arm
 * is the positive control: it proves the link mechanism was live and readable
 * during the reading, so the two nulls mean "the parser does not fire here" and
 * not "links appear only on merge".
 *
 * That closes the one unknown this doc used to carry (the fence rule was
 * previously taken on the argument that PR bodies routinely quote whole other
 * bodies, templates and logs, and scanning those would bury real findings under
 * quoted text). Both spellings are now measured, so stripping is correct rather
 * than merely reasonable, and a blocking gate may rely on it.
 *
 * Lines are replaced by empty strings rather than deleted so that nothing is
 * spliced together across a stripped block into an accidental match.
 *
 * ## `{ inline: false }` — the same fence parser, opposite need (H17)
 *
 * H17 reads the INSIDE of inline spans: a hold comment names its trigger files
 * as backticked repo-relative paths, so blanking spans would delete the entire
 * signal. It still wants fenced blocks gone, and for the same reason H7 does —
 * a hold comment routinely quotes `git grep` output and file:line evidence
 * inside a fence, and those are citations, not triggers (measured on #8656,
 * whose fenced block lists three `packages/spec/src/**` paths that are prose
 * evidence for the card and name no trigger at all).
 *
 * So the option exists rather than a second fence parser: one fence-closing
 * rule, read two ways, and neither reader can drift from the other. The
 * default is unchanged, so every existing caller keeps byte-identical output.

 *
 * Every dev branch here is `claude/issue-<n>-<slug>` by protocol, and every PR

 * same sweep reported six other H8 rows correctly) is recoverable at no API
 * cost. That is the widening this channel exists for.

 * But widening the delivery relation has a cost the fix must pay, and reading
 * the branch as merely one more disjunct does not pay it: a branch cut for card
 * N and then RE-SCOPED — the body now delivering a different card — would be
 * counted as delivering N forever, on the authority of a name nobody updated.
 * The body is the channel an author actually maintains; the branch name is
 * fixed at `git worktree add` time and is evidence only when nothing better
 * exists. So a body that declares ANY delivery is authoritative, and the branch
 * name is consulted only for the bodies that declare none — which is exactly

 *
 * `openPrs` is the open-PR list the sweep already holds (its summary line

 * exists to prevent (#10468, measured on #9834 + open PR #10226).
 *
 * Silence would fix the harm and buy a new one, and the card's caveat says so:
 * it loses the genuine #8683 case where the last half is later ABANDONED — the
 * merged half really is delivered, the card really is stale, and nothing would
 * ever say so again. So the half-delivered case gets its own quieter sentence
 * instead: it names both sides, states the counts, and — the whole point —
 * says `pm:dispatched` is CORRECT here and must not be dropped. The destructive
 * prescription fires only when every delivering PR has merged.
 *
 * Drafts are deliberately NOT filtered out of the open side: the measured
 * specimen (#10226) was `draft: true`, and a draft delivering half is exactly
 * the live work this row must not step on.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * The `Blocked-by:` line's refs, in the order written.
 *
 * ## Why this is the file's FIRST parser for a line H4 already reads
 *
 * H4 asks only "is there such a line", so its regex is a presence test and
 * extracts nothing; no other script in the repo parses these lines at all
 * (the unlock scan is a seat procedure over a grep, not code). So there is no
 * second parser to converge on here — this is the first, and H4 keeps its own
 * cheaper question rather than being rewritten around this one.
 *
 * ## Two decisions that change what gets reported
 *
 * 1. **Code context is NOT stripped from the TEXT**, unlike H7/H8/H13. Those
 *    predicates read PROSE and must protect the careful author who quotes a
 *    spelling in backticks. This one models a MACHINE READER: the state model
 *    calls the line 「机器可 grep 的反向索引」, and the unlock scan that
 *    consumes it greps the literal — so a fenced `Blocked-by:` line really
 *    does fire the live machinery, whatever the author meant. Skipping fenced
 *    regions here would report coherence against an index nothing uses; H4
 *    (the same line's other reader) does not skip them either.
 *
 *    What IS removed is the decoration wrapping the directive itself —
 *    「`Blocked-by: #9612`」 names a blocker (#10102, and see the shared
 *    reader above). That is the opposite move from H7/H8/H13's: they drop a
 *    line because it sits in code, this one reads a line whose code markers
 *    are the author formatting a directive. Both serve the same test — would
 *    the unlock sweep's grep act on this line — and its answer here is yes.
 * 2. **Only the LEADING ref run is taken.** Real lines carry trailing prose —
 *    「Blocked-by: #9689 (the relocation it needs is the same edit)」 — and
 *    prose can name a second card that is context, not a blocker. Scanning
 *    the whole value would manufacture a dependent for it, and the cost lands
 *    on a THIRD card (a phantom "missing cache" row against someone who did
 *    nothing wrong). So the scan walks refs and separators from the start of
 *    the value and stops at the first token that is neither.
 *
 * The key is matched case-sensitively and line-anchored, byte-stable like H4
 * and H9: a lowercase or mid-sentence spelling is a line the real scan cannot
 * see, and reading it here would report an index the machinery does not have.
 *
 * @param {string} body
 * @returns {{ repo: string|null, number: number }[]}

 * reading its number as a LOCAL target would invent a dependent for whatever
 * this repo's #4356 happens to be — a phantom finding against an unrelated
 * card. A ref qualified with this repo (either `owner/repo#N` or the bare

 * BOTH, and a priority order would silently drop one of two live dependencies
 * — the same class of loss as reading the body alone, just rarer.
 *
 * Dedup is per (target, source) as before, so a card naming one target in both
 * channels is listed once. Cross-repo and self-reference filtering is applied
 * to comment-borne refs identically: the ref is filtered by what it SAYS, and
 * the channel it arrived in changes nothing about that.

 * ## The two directions do NOT owe the index the same completeness (#10061)
 *
 * They make opposite claims, so an INCOMPLETE index endangers exactly one:
 *
 *   - STALE ("nothing targets it") is a claim about ABSENT evidence. Every
 *     edge the sweep failed to read is a card that might be pointing at this
 *     one, so an index with any unread source cannot support the claim at all.
 *     `options.indexComplete === false` therefore silences this direction —
 *     unreadable evidence is not absent evidence (#4690), and the remedy this
 *     row prescribes (drop a label the selection order ranks second only to
 *     `priority:p0`) is destructive enough that a guess is worse than silence.
 *     The summary line's `comment fallback read on X of Y` is what states the
 *     gap, exactly as H16's and H17's `read X of Y` do for theirs.
 *   - MISSING ("targeted, but the label never landed") is a claim about
 *     evidence IN HAND. Reading more sources can only ADD edges, never remove
 *     one, so an incomplete index cannot manufacture this row. It stays live
 *     regardless — going quiet there would trade a real finding for nothing.
 *
 * This is the recalibration #9948 ruled for on 2026-08-19 (「修量具而非追假
 * stale」): the measured false stales #9465 and #9968 were both cards whose
 * dependents state the wait in a COMMENT, and both are pinned in the self-test.
 *
 * ## STALE is also repo-local, and the row says so (#10139)
 *
 * `buildBlockingIndex` only ever scans THIS repo's open-issue listing, so
 * `indexComplete` measures whether the comment fallback read every candidate
 * — it says nothing about sibling repos. A dependent living in `objectui` or
 * `cloud` with a `Blocked-by:` line naming this card is invisible to the
 * index by construction, not by any read failure, so `indexComplete` cannot
 * gate it and never claims to. The STALE sentence therefore does not read as
 * exhaustive over "no dependent anywhere" — only "no dependent in this
 * repo" — and its remedy is conditional on a cross-repo check rather than an
 * instruction to drop the label outright: `Blocked-by:` edges are
 * protocol-legal across repos (contract-first splits use them routinely),
 * and #7917 / objectui#4356 is a live one this row would otherwise have
 * instructed a reader to sever.
 *
 * @param {object} issue — an OPEN issue.
 * @param {Map<number, number[]>} index — from `buildBlockingIndex`.

 * abandoned?", and a threshold is what turns silence into an alarm. This row
 * answers a different question — "is the lane taking blocking cards first?" —
 * and the honest answer is a NUMBER, every run, for the reader to judge. A
 * threshold would re-introduce exactly the judgement call the row exists to
 * hand over, and would go quiet on the days the board is worst behaved but
 * still under it. So: unconditional, one row, no constant. Nothing reddens
 * (nothing in this file ever does).
 *
 * ## The age is the CARD's, not the label's, and says so
 *
 * `created_at`, the same quantity the selection order's own within-rank
 * tie-break reads (同级按卡龄). The label's age would be the sharper number
 * and is not available: it lives in a per-card timeline fetch this sweep
 * deliberately never makes (the H2 comment fetch is the one exception, and it
 * is confined to candidates). Reporting card age and NAMING it as card age
 * beats reporting a number whose meaning the reader has to guess.
 *
 * An unreadable `created_at` sorts as maximally old rather than being skipped
 * — the #4690 direction the whole file keeps: a value that cannot be read must
 * surface, never quietly drop out of a "the oldest is…" claim.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * H16 threshold — the window a normal conflict resolution gets before the
 * conflict counts as STUCK.
 *
 * ## Which timestamp this ages, and why (the honest part)
 *
 * A merge conflict has NO timestamp of its own. `mergeable_state` is a verdict
 * about the PR as it stands at the moment of the read; neither the PR row nor
 * any listing this sweep makes records WHEN the PR became `dirty`. So the age
 * read here is the PR's `updated_at` — the last time anything touched the PR —
 * used as a PROXY, on the reading the incident supports: a freshly-pushed
 * dirty PR is being worked (its author is mid-resolution), while a dirty PR
 * nothing has touched for hours is one nobody has noticed.
 *
 * The proxy's error direction, stated here rather than discovered later: a
 * conflict created MINUTES ago on a PR last touched hours ago flags at once,
 * because `updated_at` measures silence on the PR and not the age of the
 * conflict — and the usual cause (`main` advancing under an open PR) does not
 * touch the PR row at all, so it does not bump the clock. That over-reports in
 * exactly one shape and under-reports in none, which is the direction this
 * file keeps everywhere: a report-only row whose remedy is identical either
 * way (merge base, resolve) costs its reader one glance, while the opposite
 * bias is the silence the incident is made of.
 *
 * ⛔ It must not be "fixed" by dating the conflict from a per-PR timeline
 * fetch. That is an extra request per candidate to sharpen a report-only row,
 * and this sweep declines that trade everywhere else it arises — H15 declines
 * it by name for the age of a label. The proxy is named in the finding text so
 * the reader knows which quantity they are being shown.
 *
 * ## Why 2h
 *
 * Conflicts on this board are overwhelmingly created by `main` advancing under
 * an open PR (~18 merges on a working day), not by authors writing
 * incompatible code, so resolution is mechanical — merge `main`, fix the
 * overlap, push — and a lane PM's landing window turns over far faster than
 * that. 2h leaves a normal resolution a full window while catching the
 * measured incident (~4h unnoticed) at roughly half its life. It matches
 * `DOMAIN_HALF_STATE_STALE_HOURS` for the same underlying reason rather than
 * by coincidence: both measure a loop that should already have turned over,
 * not intake latency.

/**
 * H16 — null when clean, else the finding sentence. Takes the SINGLE-PR
 * payload (the listing row carries no `mergeable_state`).
 *
 * ## The readings that are skips, not findings
 *
 * GitHub computes mergeability ASYNCHRONOUSLY. A read taken while that
 * background job is still running answers `unknown` (with `mergeable` null),
 * which is neither "clean" nor "dirty" — it is no reading at all. Only the
 * literal `dirty` fires: an unknown is skipped in SILENCE, never vouched for
 * and never guessed, which is this file's standing narrowness discipline (the
 * transport classifier's refusal to name what it cannot name, same posture).
 *
 * That is the one place H16 departs from the #4690 direction the aged items
 * take, and the asymmetry is deliberate rather than an inconsistency: an
 * unreadable `updated_at` is a value that SHOULD have been readable and whose
 * absence hides a real card, while `unknown` is the platform correctly saying
 * "ask again later" — firing on it would put a row on the anchor for every PR
 * whose mergeability happened to be cold at sweep time, which is noise that
 * would bury the real rows. The timestamp half keeps the #4690 direction
 * unchanged (an unreadable `updated_at` still flags).
 *
 * Drafts are out of scope (parked deliberately, H12's reading), and a row
 * without a real `draft` field is out of scope too — this predicate must not
 * flag a shape it cannot read.
 *
 * ## Why `auto_merge` is NOT read here, unlike H12
 *
 * H12 treats armed auto-merge as finding-REDUCING: the queue machinery holds
 * the PR, so someone is handling it. H16 must not, and that is the whole
 * incident — the measured specimen sat dirty with auto-merge ARMED, and the
 * arming is precisely what made every proxy signal read healthy while nothing
 * at all was happening. Auto-merge does not resolve conflicts: a PR armed
 * while dirty simply never lands. Here the armed state is evidence OF the
 * disease, never of a handler, and the self-test pins that in both directions.

// H17 — the on-hold TRIGGER-FILE INDEX. Not a predicate: an inventory.
//
// ## What it is for (#10034, measured 0-for-19)
//
// The opportunistic-restart mechanism is a maintainer-accepted design
// (2026-08-11): a hold comment names the FILES whose next edit should wake the
// card, and a dispatching seat is supposed to intersect its dispatch's file
// surface against those lists before dispatching. The audit that produced this
// item measured the intersection never running in any lane: across six cards
// the named trigger files were touched NINETEEN times and the rider was
// carried ZERO times. The mechanism existed in SKILL.md and in hold comments;
// no seat's loop executed it.
//
// The fix is not another written protocol step. It is to put the list where
// the seat is already looking: the patrol anchor, which the dispatch protocol
// now makes the first thing read each round. This section renders card → files
// so the intersection is a GLANCE at a rendered table rather than a
// remembered procedure over 79 hold comments nobody opens.
//
// ## Why it lives on the PATROL side and not in `dispatch-gates.mjs`
//
// The obvious shape — teach the dispatch gate to grep hold comments — cannot
// run where the dispatch gate runs. A seat container's live GitHub read is 403
// (the repo-scoped transport fact this whole file's prerequisite classifier
// exists to name), so an intersection built into `dispatch-gates.mjs` would be
// a second mechanism that never executes: exactly the disease, re-created one
// layer down. The patrol runs on a GitHub Actions runner where the transport
// prerequisite is met, so the gathering happens there and the seat reads the
// rendered result. Zero new runtime dependency on the seat side.
//
// ## REPORT-ONLY, and more strictly than the predicates above
//
// Every H1–H16 row is an assertion that something is WRONG. An H17 row asserts
// nothing of the kind: a hold naming trigger files is a hold in perfectly good
// standing. So this item writes no label, has no staleness threshold, and can
// never produce a finding — it is inventory, rendered next to the findings
// because that is the page the reader already opens. The only bound in it is a
// RENDER budget (`H17_INDEX_ROW_CAP`), which is the same class of constant as
// `MARKDOWN_BODY_BUDGET` and not a judgement about the board.
//
// ## The extraction is deterministic, and drops what it cannot verify
//
// ⛔ No fuzzy parsing, and no LLM in the loop. Two stages, both closed:
//
//   1. ANCHOR. A line qualifies only if it carries one of a closed set of
//      terms (`H17_TRIGGER_ANCHOR_TERMS`) or is a canonical `Restart-touch:`
//      line. Everything else in the comment is ignored, however path-shaped.
//   2. VALIDATE. Every candidate token is checked against `git ls-files`. A
//      token that is not a TRACKED FILE is DROPPED — never guessed at, never
//      normalised into something that would match. This is what makes the
//      index safe to render without review: a wrong row would send a seat to
//      intersect against a path that does not exist, and the intersection
//      would silently never hit.
//
// The census that produced the term set is in `H17_TRIGGER_ANCHOR_TERMS`.

//
//   • `Blocked-by: #10126` parked in a COMMENT; the target closed
//     2026-08-20T09:03:37Z; the card sat blocked ~4.5 h past that and was
//     released only because a human walked the lane's dependency graph.

//     by a manual triage pass.

// The release is a protocol procedure with two mechanical double-checks the

 * the row exists to keep visible. "Could not be read" is not "still open": a
 * target dropped in silence reads as a healthy block FOREVER, which is
 * precisely this item's own disease wearing a new mask. So an unresolved
 * target FIRES a row — a quieter one, which says the liveness is unjudged
 * rather than asserting anything about the block.
 *
 * ## The cause is MEASURED now, not guessed — and still never inferred (#11218)
 *
 * This row used to refuse to name a CAUSE for an unresolved target, on solid
 * grounds: a 404 on `owner/repo#N` is equally "that repo is not reachable to
 * this credential" and "that issue number does not exist in a perfectly
 * reachable repo", and this file's standing posture is to refuse to name what it
 * cannot DISTINGUISH (the transport classifier's narrowness, H16's refusal to
 * vouch for an `unknown` mergeability).
 *
 * The two ARE distinguishable, by one extra reading, and refusing to make it was
 * leaving a real fact on the floor. `GET /repos/<owner>/<name>` answers whether
 * this credential can see the repo AT ALL, independently of any issue number in
 * it. Repo readable + issue 404 ⇒ the number does not exist there. Repo 404 ⇒ a
 * CREDENTIAL SCOPE gap, and the target is unjudgeable for a reason that has
 * nothing to do with the card. That is the same two-stage shape
 * `classifyRepoRead` already uses on the swept repo — a second reading turning
 * an ambiguous refusal into a named one — and it costs ONE request per distinct
 * SIBLING repo per sweep (2 on this board), cached, never per target.
 *
 * ⛔ What did NOT change is the posture: the row still reports only what it
 * OBSERVED. The probe is a measurement, not an inference, and where it is
 * unavailable the wording falls back to the old undiagnosed sentence rather than
 * guessing.
 *
 * ## Why this is the whole of the cross-repo half that CAN land here
 *
 * The unresolvable class is cross-repo by construction — the contract-first
 * split manufactures it (a parent plus one sub-issue per repo, the downstream
 * carrying `Blocked-by:`). Giving the resolver a genuine cross-repo READ needs a
 * credential the patrol does not hold and by standing ruling will not be given:
 * the workflow header states it (「⛔ Each install uses its OWN
 * `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` and reads its own repo. No cross-repo credential, no
 * matrix over repos, no PAT」 — refused at grading, per-repo install chosen
 * instead), and Actions' own token is repo-scoped by construction, so this is not
 * a knob this file could turn even if it wanted to. ⛔ Widening it is a
 * routing/security decision and not this script's to take.
 *
 * The accepted consequence, named in that same ruling, is that a cross-repo
 * target stays UNJUDGED in each install. This row's job is therefore to make
 * that UNJUDGED honest and LOUD rather than to pretend it away — which is what
 * the probe above and the anti-truncation handling in `renderMarkdown` do.
 *
 * ## A PARTIAL discharge is reported as partial, not as an unblock
 *
 * A card naming two blockers where one has closed is very possibly still
 * legitimately blocked. The row says how many closed and how many are still
 * open and leaves the judgement where the protocol puts it — with the unlock
 * sweep's double-checks. Report-only means the row never decides; it also
 * means the row must not go quiet on a half-expired block, because "one of
 * your two blockers landed" is exactly the state a seat cannot see by looking.
 *
 * @param {object} issue — an OPEN issue.
 * @param {{ key: string, number: number, local: boolean,

//        and complete, which is exactly the point.
//   H4 / H14  `Blocked-by:` — not a blocked card.
//   H9   `pm:on-hold` without `Restart-when:` — not held.
//   H8   a MERGED PR while still dispatched — nothing merged; nothing ran.
// Nothing asked whether a card labelled `pm:dispatched` is actually BEING
// WORKED. That is the same missing question H19 asks about a block: a state
// label asserting an external fact that nothing re-checks.
//
// ## Measured — #8878, 2026-08-20
//
// The claim comment (`5356927509`) was posted at ~14:05Z. Before the dispatch
// tool was called a maintainer message arrived and was answered, and the
// second half never happened. The card sat `pm:dispatched` with nobody on it
// for 74 MINUTES, until a patrol tick compared branch heads and found no ref.
//
// ⚠️ The interruption is the MECHANISM, not an excuse: any seat that answers a
// message, hits a tool error, or loses context between the claim and the launch
// produces the same state. And ⚠️ the symptom is IDENTICAL to a dev agent that
// died (no branch, no PR, no report) while the remedies are OPPOSITE — a dead
// agent needs a probe, an undispatched claim needs a dispatch. So the row
// reports the observation and names both readings; it does not diagnose one.
//
// ## ⛔ The key is "NO REF AT ALL" — never "no PR yet"
//
// This is the one thing the item must not get wrong, and the filing card is
// explicit: a dev inside a long build legitimately has a ref and no PR for
// over an hour, which that round measured repeatedly. Keying on the PR would
// fire hardest on the healthiest dev on the board. The guarantee here is
// structural rather than a matter of care — `h20DispatchedNoBranchRef` is
// handed a REF STATE and nothing else, so it cannot see a PR and cannot key on
// one — and the ref-exists-with-no-PR shape is a regression pin below.
//
// ## Three ref states, never two (#4690)
//
// `exists` → healthy, no row. `absent` → the finding. `unreadable` (any
// non-404 failure) → its OWN quieter row saying the dispatch is unjudged. The
// third is the one the row exists to keep visible: a ref read dropped in
// silence reads as a healthy dispatch forever, which is this item's own
// disease wearing a new mask. H19 landed the same three-way shape for the same
// reason, and this follows it deliberately rather than inventing a second
// spelling.

 * ## The measured basis
 *
 * This lane's dispatch→draft-PR latency was measured at 35–50 minutes, and a

 * os-dev creates, ahead of the first edit (the branch-push probe is step 1 of
 * the dev contract), so the observable this row keys on lands minutes into a
 * run rather than at its end. 60 minutes therefore sits above the whole
 * measured PR band while keying on a signal that arrives far earlier, which is
 * why it can be this tight without firing on a slow dev.
 *
 * Against the specimen: #8878 sat 74 minutes, so 60 catches it with 14 minutes
 * to spare. The card's own recommendation was "around 60 minutes with no ref at

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// H21 — a closing keyword bound to `#N` inside a sentence that NEGATES it
// (#10392). H7's rationale, minus H7's `Part of` precondition.
//
// ## The gap, and the card it cost
//
// H7's header states the rule in fully general terms — GitHub's parser "matches
// the keyword plus the number and ignores the surrounding prose entirely,
// negations and modals included, so the sentence an author writes to PREVENT an
// auto-close is exactly what performs it on merge". The PREDICATE behind that
// sentence is narrower than the sentence: it is bound to a `Part of #N`
// declaration and fires only when the same `#N` carries both. A body that
// declares `Part of` for nothing is silent by construction, however plainly it
// says it is not closing the card.
//
// Measured specimen — PR #10241, merged 2026-08-20T15:10:06Z. Its body carries
// no `Part of` anywhere and this sentence under `## Out of scope`:
//
//     Filed, not fixed: #10240 — the same leak through the **delete** verb.
//
// Issue #10240 closed `completed` at 15:10:08Z — two seconds later — with a
// closing-link summary naming #10241 and nothing else. #10240 is a genuine
// unfixed defect (attachment tombstoning no-ops on a predicate delete); it read
// as finished until a human reopened it a day later. The author wrote the
// sentence to record that the card was deliberately LEFT OPEN, and the sentence
// closed it. H7 was silent, exactly as designed.
//
// ## Why this is a window and not "flag every closing keyword"
//
// The naive widening is not available and the corpus says so quantitatively: a
// PR cannot declare which cards it intends to close except BY using the keyword,
// so a rule over keyword-presence alone cannot separate intent from accident.
// Over the 300 most recently merged PR bodies (below), 277 carry a closing
// keyword bound to a number and there are 301 such matches — flagging keyword
// presence would produce 301 findings, every one of them a correct PR.
//
// The negation is what makes the two separable, because it is the AUTHOR'S OWN
// statement of intent sitting in the same sentence as the instruction that
// contradicts it. That is a contradiction internal to one sentence, which is
// the same shape H7 already reports across `Part of` and a keyword.
//
// ## The window bound is load-bearing — measured, not assumed
//
// Corpus (2026-08-21, this change's own stage-1 measurement): the 300 most
// recently merged PRs into `main`, bodies as the API returns them,
// 2026-08-19T15:13:23Z … 2026-08-21T19:11:30Z, 2,564,259 body characters, no
// empty bodies. Read through `stripMarkdownCode`, exactly as H7 reads.
//
//   window scope             flagged / 301 keyword matches
//   sentence (this rule)       1   — PR #10241, the specimen. 0 false positives.
//   paragraph                  1   — same single hit
//   whole body before match   14   — 13 false positives
//   anywhere in body         301   — the naive shape; useless
//
// All 13 whole-body false positives are ONE PR (#10714) which legitimately
// closes fourteen cards with a wall of `Fixes #N` lines and merely contains a
// negation word somewhere earlier in a long body. A body-scoped negation check
// would red-flag the most correct multi-close PR in the corpus thirteen times.
// That is why the window is a sentence and why it is stated in code rather than
// left to a reviewer's judgement.
//
// The result is not clean for lack of opportunity, which is the failure mode a
// 0-of-301 number invites: the same corpus carries 116 sentences in exactly the
// deliberate-non-closure register this rule reads — `## Out of scope`,
// "filed, not fixed here", "#N is not addressed here", "#N remains open". The
// register is everywhere; only one author put a closing keyword next to the
// number. Two near-misses are worth naming because they are the specimen's
// wording almost exactly and are correctly clean: #10876's "## Out of scope —
// filed, not repaired here" and #10851's "filed, not fixed here" — neither
// binds a keyword to a number.
//
// Second corpus, a different surface and the same answer: all 1,418 squash
// commit messages on `main` (2026-08-11 … 2026-08-21) — a surface GitHub's
// closing-keyword parser also reads — carry 228 keyword+`#N` matches across 197
// commits and produce 0 flags. That arm contributes no true positive either:
// commit messages here do not carry the `## Out of scope` register at all.
//
// ## Report-only, and deliberately NOT wired to the blocking gate
//
// `scripts/check-partof-closing-keyword.mjs` imports `h7PartOfWithClosingKeyword`
// and FAILS a PR on it. This predicate is deliberately a separate function that
// that gate does not import, so widening the class cannot silently widen a
// blocking check. Report-only first is the commissioned order (#10392 triage,
// 2026-08-21): measure, ship the row, and let a promotion to blocking be its own
// decision with these numbers in hand. Nothing about this file's report-only
// contract changes, and the existing patrol workflow already calls the sweep, so
// no workflow edit is part of this.
//
// ## Disjoint from H7 by construction
//
// A number already declared `Part of #N` is H7's row and is skipped here, so the
// two never double-report one number. H7 keeps that class whether or not the
// sentence is negated (its own self-test pins a negated `Part of` body as an H7
// finding); this rule takes the class H7 cannot see — a keyword bound to a
// number the body never declared itself part of.

 * ⚠️ This is deliberately NOT `PM_STATE_LABELS` (H13's), and the two must not
 * be unified on the strength of the similar name. H13 asks "does any label make
 * this card visible to a named reader?", so its list carries `finding`,
 * `needs-user-decision`, `pm:epic` and `pm:seat` and deliberately OMITS
 * `pm:blocking`. H22 asks a different question — "does this label CLAIM work is
 * in flight?" — and the answers diverge in both directions: `pm:blocking` is
 * such a claim (it is what the lane selection order ranks on) while `finding`
 * and `needs-user-decision` are perfectly good states for a closed card to have
 * ended in. Sharing one list would make H22 report every closed finding card on
 * the board and miss the blocking-cache residue entirely.
 *
 * Three `pm:*` labels are excluded here because they are not claims that work
 * is in flight:
 *
 *   `pm:seat`     a seat-registry post's TYPE sticker — the protocol carrier
 *                 itself, whose label is what makes the seat list page a board.
 *                 A closed seat card keeps it as identity, not as state.
 *   `pm:epic`     a delegation marker on a parent, the same kind of identity.
 *   `pm:retriage` a request for re-judgement. Plausibly residue too, and it did
 *                 not appear in the census — so it stays out until something
 *                 measures it, rather than being widened in on a hunch. The
 *                 set is one edit away when that measurement exists.

// H23 — the SECOND SURFACE: a squash commit message on the default branch that
// carries `Part of #N` and a closing keyword bound to that same `#N` (#10942).
//
// ## The gap
//
// Every closing-keyword reader this repo owns is handed a PULL REQUEST BODY.
// H7 and H21 above take a `pr` and read `pr.body`;
// `scripts/check-partof-closing-keyword.mjs` — the blocking gate — is handed
// `PR_BODY` by `.github/workflows/partof-closing-keyword-guard.yml`. GitHub's
// closing-keyword parser acts on TWO surfaces: the PR body, and the COMMIT
// MESSAGES of commits that land on the default branch. This repo squash-merges,
// so every merged PR contributes exactly one commit message to `main`, and that
// message was never read by anything here.
//
// ## The mechanism, and why a body-side guard could not have caught it
//
// The squash message is COMPOSED AT MERGE TIME from the branch's own commit
// messages — not from the PR body. All six specimens below are multi-commit
// branches where one commit's trailer said `Fixes #N` and another's said
// `Part of #N`; the squash concatenated them, and the contradiction was
// manufactured by the assembly. Measured on the clearest one, PR #9478: its
// BODY carries a closing keyword bound to #9320 and no `Part of` anywhere, so
// the body is clean under H7 and under the blocking gate, and correctly so —
// the contradictory text existed in no body at all. This is why the row cannot
// be "H7 with a wider input": there is a text on `main` that no body ever held.
//
// ## Measured (2026-08-22, this change's own stage-1 pass)
//
// Corpus: all 1,546 first-parent commit messages on `main` in the window
// 2026-08-11T00:00:00Z … 2026-08-22T18:00:00Z (first and last message
// 2026-08-11T01:21:16Z … 2026-08-22T17:59:02Z), read with the extractors above at
// `markdown: false`. `main` is LINEAR — 1,975 commits reachable, 1,975 on the
// first-parent walk, 0 merge commits — so the commit list and the squash-message
// list are the same list, and the REST reader below needs no first-parent filter.
//
// ⚠️ The window bounds are spelled as full ISO instants on purpose. `git log
// --since=2026-08-11` is an APPROXIDATE: git fills the unspecified time-of-day
// from *now*, so a bare date silently slides the corpus forward as the clock
// moves — two runs of this measurement twelve minutes apart returned 1,443 and
// 1,441 messages for what read as one window. Anyone re-deriving these numbers
// must pin both instants or they are measuring a different corpus.
//
//   270 closing-keyword bindings across 234 messages
//     6 messages carry `Part of #N` AND a keyword bound to that same `#N`
//         sha          card      keyword    (columns kept apart on purpose — see
//         0c24898c0    10377     Fixes       the remedy note below; this file
//         d7283250d    10219     Fixes       must not itself put a keyword next

//         3db37957c     8355     Fixes
//         7e06f51ee     8060     Fixes
//         30536e37c     7828     Fixes
//   1,545 of 1,546 subjects end with the squash marker `(#PR)`
//       0 of those 1,545 trailing markers are bound as a card by the extractor
//
// That last number is the PR-correlation guarantee, and it is measured rather
// than argued: the separator in `closingKeywordRe` is horizontal whitespace and
// an optional colon, so the `(` in `… (#11085)` stands between any preceding
// keyword and the number and no subject's own PR marker can ever be read as a
// card binding. `commitSubjectPrNumber` reads it as what it is instead.
//
// ⚠️ Six rows are evidence that the shape REACHES `main` unguarded, not six
// adjudicated wrong closes. In every one the lead commit's `Fixes #N` looks
// deliberate, so the finding sentence reports the contradiction and explicitly
// declines to adjudicate it — the reader checks the card. Deciding whether this
// class ever earns a BLOCKING posture is a later card on its own baseline
// (grading ruling, 2026-08-22): this row exists to measure the surface first,
// exactly the posture #10392 was required to take for the body surface.
//
// ## The remedy text differs from H7's and H21's, and that is the point
//
// H7 and H21 both end with "or put the keyword in backticks", which is CORRECT
// for a body and FALSE here: a commit message is not markdown, nothing renders
// it, and backticks are ordinary characters to the parser. An author who has
// internalised the body remedy is precisely the author who will reach for it on
// this surface, so the sentence says out loud that it does not work here and
// gives the only remedy that does — reword, so no closing keyword sits next to
// the number. The self-test pins the difference in BOTH directions (H7's
// sentence carries the backtick clause; this one must never carry it), because
// the realistic regression is someone copying H7's tail across.
//
// ## Why H21's negation window is NOT ported to this surface
//
// Measured, on the same 1,546-message corpus: H21's window and marker set flag
// 0 of the 270 bindings. Commit messages here do not carry the deliberate-
// non-closure register at all — no `## Out of scope`, no "filed, not fixed
// here" — because that register belongs to a PR body's prose sections. Porting
// it would add a second predicate over this surface with zero measured yield
// and its own false-positive risk, so it stays out until something measures a
// reason for it. (`sentenceStartOffset` was already written with this surface in
// mind — its docblock declines to treat a plain newline as a boundary precisely
// because commit messages hard-wrap at ~72 columns — so the port is available to
// a later card at no design cost.)
//
// ## And why stripping is not merely "harmless to skip"
//
// On this corpus the two readings agree exactly — 270 bindings either way, and
// the same 6 findings — so the asymmetry buys no finding today, and saying
// otherwise would be a claim the measurement does not support. It is not clean
// for lack of opportunity, which is the failure mode a 0-difference number
// invites: 1,064 of the 1,546 messages DO carry markdown-looking code (a squash
// body routinely quotes the PR body whole), 487 of those carry a `#N` inside the
// code region and 361 carry a closing-keyword word inside it. But not one
// carries a keyword and a number ADJACENT inside code — which is why the two
// readings agree. The population is everywhere; no author has
// yet landed the two adjacent inside a fence. The first who does — most likely
// the author following the body-surface remedy — is the case the surface-correct
// reading catches and a stripped reading would silently drop.

//
// ## Why it is its own row rather than a widening of H1/H2/H3
//
// Every adjacent row declines this shape for a reason of its own, which is how
// 17 cards across three repos sat in it with nothing reporting them: H1 wants a
// dispatched card with NO assignee (this one HAS one), H2 wants a MISSING claim
// comment (the measured carriers have complete ones — they were claimed, worked
// and then rolled back), and H3 wants two LABELS (here exactly one label is
// present and the second half of the contradiction lives in a different FIELD).
// The shape falls precisely between them.
//
// ## What the contradiction costs
//
// The two readers disagree and BOTH are right about what they read:
//
//   the queue view    reads `pm:queue` as "dispatchable now";
//   the claim rule    reads a non-empty assignee as "taken, ⛔ never reassign".
//
// So the card is simultaneously available to everyone and forbidden to
// everyone, and the outcome is not a race but PARALYSIS — a card nobody can
// legally move, in the one state no seat has a reason to look at twice. The
// census this row was filed on (2026-08-23, REST full pagination): 135 open
// `pm:queue` cards in objectstack of which 6 were assigned, 146/10 in objectui,
// 19/1 in cloud.
//
// ## Zero judgement, by construction — and the ordering that makes it safe
//
// The predicate is a pure intersection of two fields with no threshold, no
// timestamp and no identity test in it. That is deliberate: the same census
// found the assignee field carrying TWO different meanings (dead agent claims
// left by a state rollback, and genuine human ownership on a handful of
// objectui cards), and a row that tried to tell them apart would be guessing at
// the one thing this file refuses to guess at. The maintainer's ruling settles
// the order (2026-08-23): the rule lands FIRST and any true-ownership exemption
// is an explicit marker LATER — never the other way round. An exemption
// invented here, in the absence of that marker, would silently un-report the
// exact population the row exists for.
//
// ⛔ And the remedy is asymmetric, so the sentence says so: an agent may clear
// a dead agent claim on the evidence, and must NEVER clear a human's
// assignment.

//
//   • `pm:queue` + `needs-user-decision` — the state model defines `pm:queue`

//     label was never taken off — 「判断做了(有分析产出),状态写入没做」.
//   • `pm:queue` + `pm:blocked` — the unlock/park transitions are two

//     three days.

 * The ONE-OF vocabulary, in ONE place: the awaiting state plus the five it
 * excludes. Derived from H25's list rather than re-typed, so the two rows can
 * never disagree about what a "pm state" is — the same single-constant
 * discipline `AWAITING_MAINTAINER_LABEL` itself was introduced with, and the
 * failure family this whole file belongs to.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is the THIRD `pm:*` label set in this file, and the three are
 * deliberately different questions with deliberately different answers. Do not
 * unify them on the strength of the similar names — the self-test pins all
 * three pairwise:
 *
 *   `PM_STATE_LABELS`      (H13) "does any label make this card VISIBLE to a
 *                          named reader?" — so it carries `finding`, `pm:epic`
 *                          and `pm:seat`, none of which is a position on the
 *                          work state machine.
 *   `PM_RESIDUE_LABELS`    (H22) "does this label CLAIM work is in flight?" —
 *                          so it carries `pm:blocking` (a derived priority
 *                          cache, not a state) and drops `needs-user-decision`
 *                          (a fine state to close in).
 *   `PM_EXCLUSIVE_STATE_LABELS` (H25/H29) "is this a position the card can be
 *                          IN, such that two of them contradict?" — identity
 *                          stickers (`pm:seat`, `pm:epic`) legally coexist
 *                          with any state and are out; `pm:blocking` and
 *                          `pm:retriage` are annotations ON a state and are
 *                          out; `finding` is a card KIND rather than a
 *                          position and is out. `needs-user-decision` is IN,
 *                          because a card awaiting a ruling is somewhere, and

// dispatchable now, with nothing left to ask. Every other aged row here
// (H10/H11/H12/H13/H18) watches a state where waiting is legal and asks whether
// the wait has gone too long. This one watches the state where waiting is not a
// state at all, and asks why nothing happened.
//
// The measured incident: three cards left in `pm:queue` while the seat that
// owned them had already produced the analysis that should have moved them
// (「判断做了(有分析产出),状态写入没做(纯开销的那半)」). Nothing on the
// board said so, because a queued card looks exactly like a queued card no
// matter how long it has been one — the queue view's ordinary contents and a
// forgotten card are the same rows.
//
// ## The horizon, and why it is NOT H11's 7 days
//
// The aging SHAPE is H11's — `updated_at`, report-only, threshold named in the
// row, an unreadable stamp flagging rather than reading as fresh. The NUMBER is
// not, and reusing it would have been the mistake: 7 days is calibrated for a
// PARKED state, where a legitimate short park has cleared by then. Measured
// against all 40 open `pm:queue` cards on 2026-08-24:
//
//   >1d 17 · >2d 10 · >3d 8 · >4d 4 · >5d 3 · >7d 0
//
// At 7 days the row cannot fire on today's board at all — a check that cannot
// fail is the shape this file exists to catch, not to add. At 1 day it reports
// 43% of the queue, which is queue DEPTH rather than rot. 3 days is the
// smallest horizon that clears the ordinary depth while still exceeding the
// measured dual-hang this card was filed on (3 days), and it names 8 of 40 —
// a minority a human can actually walk.
//
// ## What the row asks for, and what it refuses to judge
//
// It does NOT say the card is wrong, and it does not rank it. It forces ONE
// explicit transition — dispatch it, convert it to `needs-user-decision`,
// withdraw it, or rewrite it — because the failure this closes is a decision
// that was made and never written down. Report-only, and pointedly: a sweeper
// that re-labelled here would be choosing the transition, which is the whole

// on the card AND on the PR, hung in one stroke and — the half that failed —
// cleared in one stroke, each carrier written through the label discipline's
// read-modify-write + read-back (SKILL.md 2026-08-18: 「承载闸门语义的标签……挂与
// 清两向同此四步,闸门被剥不是红灯是放行」).
//
// Two writes, one postcondition, and nothing ever checked the pair. The
// measured miss: a PASS verdict was posted, the PR carrier was cleared, and the
// card carrier was not — so the card stayed gated behind a review that had
// already passed, and the only evidence that anything was wrong was the label
// itself, on a card nobody was looking at.
//
// The other direction is the dangerous one and the same row catches it: a gate
// stripped from the card while the PR still carries it reads, to the enqueue
// path, as a card that was never gated. 「闸门被剥不是红灯是放行」 — a stripped
// gate is a GREEN light, and 「被剥」 and 「从未挂过」 are indistinguishable in
// the evidence. A row comparing the two carriers is the only reader that can
// tell them apart.
//
// LIVE at the time of writing (2026-08-24): card #11427 carries the gate while
// its delivering open PR #11844 does not.
//
// ## The silence that is NOT a bug: a card with no delivering open PR
//
// `references/contract-review.md` makes card-side-FIRST legal and expected:
// 「PR 一存在即挂,报告先于 PR 到达则先挂卡侧、ACCEPT 时补齐 PR 侧」. So a gated
// card with no PR yet is a correct intermediate state, not a premature hang,
// and this row stays silent on it — deliberately declining the "gate label on a
// card with no PR carrier is premature" shape, which would report the protocol's
// own prescribed sequence as a defect. The comparison begins when a delivering
// PR exists, which is exactly when the pair becomes checkable.
//
// ## Free, and bounded
//
// The open-PR listing is already in hand (H7/H12/H21 list it, H8 already passes
// it around for the same delivery question), and the delivery relation is
// `prDeliversCard` — the same body-first/branch-fallback relation H8 reads, so
// this row can never disagree with H8 about which PR delivers which card. No
// request, no new parser. MERGED PRs are deliberately out of scope: the gate
// governs enqueue and landing while the PR is open, and a merged carrier is a
// closed-out stroke rather than a live half-write.
//
// Report-only, and emphatically: this is a GATE. ⛔ Never a label written from
// this script — a sweeper that hung or cleared a review gate would be issuing
// the review verdict, and the one thing the whole clause-② chain forbids is

// H26 — a block with no scheduled releaser, and the stale chain (#11219).
//
// The unlock predicate is "the `Blocked-by:` target CLOSED". Nothing in the
// machinery is SCHEDULED to close a `pm:on-hold` / `needs-user-decision`
// target: the release has to come from a human deciding to unpark it. A block
// naming such a target is therefore indefinite in the only sense this row can
// measure — no scheduled releaser — and until this row nothing said so.
//
// ## ⛔ What this row used to say, and why it no longer says it (objectui#9317)
//
// Until #9317 this row asserted that `pm:on-hold` and `needs-user-decision` are
// "by definition states a card sits in WHILE OPEN", so the block had "NO
// MECHANISM THAT WILL EVER RELEASE IT". That was asserted, never counted, and
// counting refuted it. Re-derived on this branch, 2026-09-13, objectui only,
// REST `/issues?labels=<L>&state=<S>&per_page=100`, pull requests excluded, the
// population being every ISSUE in this repository carrying the label:
//
//   label                    open issues   closed issues   closed `state_reason`
//   `pm:on-hold`                     62               7   6 completed, 1 not_planned
//   `needs-user-decision`             3               3   3 completed
//   `pm:blocked` (control)          100               7   —
//
// Control with a known direction, and it HIT: the same enumerator returned
// non-zero on all three closed rows (7, 3, 7), so the closed column is not a
// query artefact — a broken `state=closed` would have returned 0 on all three.
// ⇒ cards DO close out of both states, and 9 of the 10 measured closures were
// `completed` — the hold lifted and the work finished, which is exactly the
// release the old wording said could not exist. ⚠️ Those are dated counts, not
// live ones: the instrument is the command above, re-run it rather than trust
// the row. The EXISTENCE claim is what this row now rests on, and existence
// does not rot — a card that has closed out of `pm:on-hold` stays closed.
//
// ⭐ This file had already counted the refutation against itself: the objectui
// port census below records `pm:on-hold` on 1 closed card in a 6.2-day window,
// written 15 days before the "by definition" sentence was relied upon; and H22's
// own docblock says `needs-user-decision` is "a perfectly good state for a closed
// card to have ended in" — the direct converse, in the same file.
//
// ⚠️ The cost of the old wording was not a wrong report body: it was quoted
// outward as a structural verdict ("this card's unlock predicate can never
// fire") and used as grounds to abandon locks that would otherwise have been
// opened. A gate's assertion travels further than its evidence.
//
// ## Why every existing check passes on these cards
//
// The waiting card is perfectly well-formed — it has its machine-readable line
// (H4 clean), its target resolves, the target is open (H19 clean), its label is
// correct. H9 is the nearest neighbour and asks the mirror question: it audits
// the HELD card for a fireable `Restart-when:`. Nobody audited the card WAITING
// on one. So the card passes every gauge and still cannot move — which is why
// the six measured instances were found by a human reading, not by any sweep:
//
//   cloud#1119, cloud#799  -> cloud#987      (`pm:on-hold`), parked since July
//   cloud#861              -> cloud#855      (`pm:on-hold`)
//   objectos#75, #135      -> objectos#68    (`needs-user-decision`)
//   cloud#1332             -> cloud#1331     (`pm:queue`, titled `[Decision]`)
//
// The last row is deliberately NOT reported by this predicate: a decision card
// wearing a work label is a mislabelling to fix, not a fact readable from the
// labels this row reads, and inventing a title heuristic would make the sweeper
// guess at intent. Two of the rows are one repo's ENTIRE blocked inventory
// waiting on its one unanswered decision card — one ruling clears the repo.
//
// ## The second leg: the stale chain
//
// `cloud#1395` -> `objectstack#10101`, which is OPEN, so the block reads live.
// But #10101 was itself an H19 finding on the same sweep: both of ITS blockers
// had already closed. The block was real one level up and false two levels up,
// and a single-level predicate cannot see that. Flagging a target that is
// itself `pm:blocked` is the cheap, honest version of that: it does not chase
// the chain (which would cost a request per hop and could cycle), it says the
// wait is TRANSITIVE so a reader knows to look one level further.
//
// ## Quota
//
// Free. H19 already resolves each distinct target — from an open listing this
// sweep holds, or with one GET — and a resolved target's LABELS are a field
// that was already in the payload. Nothing here adds a request; the resolution
// rows simply stopped throwing the labels away.
//
// Report-only, and pointedly not a judgement that the block is WRONG: waiting
// on a deferred card is sometimes exactly right. The row says this block has no
// SCHEDULED releaser — someone has to want the unpark, and nothing in the
// machinery wants it on a timetable — which is the thing a human should see
// rather than discover in a hand sweep.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// H27 — the claim is PERFECT and the claimant is gone (#11248).
//
// H20 above asks whether a dispatch ever HAPPENED, and keys on NO REMOTE REF AT
// ALL. This row asks the opposite-shaped question: the ref exists, the claim is
// textbook-correct, and nothing has moved since. The two are disjoint by
// construction — H20 fires only when no branch resolves, H27 only when one
// does — and neither could be widened into the other without losing the
// property that makes it safe.
//
// ## Why the ref EXISTS in the failure this row is built on
//
// The dev-agent definition makes pushing the empty branch the FIRST action of
// the task, before any edit, as a write-route probe (`.claude/agents/os-dev.md`
// rule 1). So an agent that dies at any point after its first minute — which is
// every point that matters — leaves a branch ON THE REMOTE. That protocol step
// is correct and worth keeping, but it has a side effect nobody priced: it
// converts the dead-agent case out of H20's population and into a population
// with no reader at all. The better the dev follows the protocol, the more
// invisible its death.
//
// ## The measured incident
//
// Three devs were dispatched concurrently and all three died at once on one
// shared-account capacity limit — fleet-wide exhaustion is a single point of
// failure for every agent in flight, so this arrives in batches, not singly.
// Each card was left `pm:dispatched`, assigned, carrying a claim comment whose
// first line is literally `Claim:`, naming a branch that exists. Every
// predicate in this file passed. Worse than merely unreported: the next PM's
// round-open mutual-exclusion read looks for the latest non-self `Claim:` on a
// lane's dispatched cards, so it reads those corpses as LIVE claims by another
// session and stays off them. The protocol's own mutual-exclusion mechanism
// converts a dead claim into a lane-wide block.
//
// ## Threshold: the protocol's own line, not a new heuristic
//
// SKILL.md already carries a stale-claim reclaim rule at 「认领 >~24h」, so this
// row mechanizes an existing protocol threshold rather than inventing a
// liveness distribution the fleet does not have (the filing card is explicit
// that 2 samples is not a distribution). The same 24 hours is already the seat
// -post patrol's own line — 「与既有回收线同一条」 — so the number has one
// source in the protocol and two readers, rather than two numbers.
//
// ⚠️ The protocol's reclaim rule and this row are NOT the same act, and the
// remedy sentence keeps them apart. That rule reclaims a claim whose branch
// does not exist, and it says 「有带提交活分支的认领永不回收」 — a claim whose
// branch carries commits is never reclaimed. This row fires on branches that DO
// exist, some of them carrying commits, so it deliberately prescribes the
// recovery INSPECTION and never the reclaim: reporting a card is not reclaiming
// it, and the row must not be readable as authority to drop an assignee the
// protocol protects.

 *   a claimed branch EXISTS  (else it is H20's row, not this one)

 *   no PR delivers the card  neither open nor within the merged window
 *
 * ⛔ Dropping the branch-activity term would give exactly the PR-keyed row H20
 * refuses to be, and it is refused there for a measured reason: a dev inside a
 * long build legitimately has a ref and no PR for over an hour. That objection
 * is answered here by BOTH remaining terms and not by the threshold alone — a
 * dev 24 hours in with commits landing is excluded by branch activity, and a
 * dev with a PR open is excluded by delivery. What is left is a branch that has
 * not moved since it was claimed, with nothing to show for a day.
 *
 * ## What it under-reports, stated rather than discovered
 *
 * A dev that pushed one commit and THEN died is not reported: its branch moved
 * after the claim, so the activity term clears it. That is the measured shape
 * of one of the three incident cards, and widening the term to "no activity in
 * the last 24h" would catch it — at the cost of colliding with the protocol's
 * 「有带提交活分支的认领永不回收」, which is a rule about exactly that card.
 * Under-reporting on a card the protocol protects is the same call H17's
 * extractor and H20's branch-shape matcher make: a row a reader cannot act on
 * is worse than no row.

// H28 — the STALE BODY LINE that shadowed the live blocker (#11747).
//
// The body is the canonical home for `Blocked-by:`; a comment is a legal second
// channel, deliberately, because rewriting a body through the MCP escaping
// hazard is the riskier write. Those two facts are consistent right up to the
// moment a card is RE-PARKED, and then they collide: the seat that finds the
// body's upstream closed cards the real prerequisite, writes the NEW blocker
// into a comment — the cheap, safe write — and leaves the SPENT one in the
// body. The card is now stating two blockers, one of them a fact about the
// past, and the machinery cannot tell which is current from the line alone.
//
// ## Why ungating the liveness read is necessary and NOT sufficient
//
// Before `needsBlockerLivenessComments`, the liveness read borrowed H4's gate
// and so read only the body on exactly these cards: it resolved the closed
// target, found nothing else, and published "every target it names is closed:
// nothing this card declared a wait on is still running" — a false unlock
// candidate, three sweeps running, acted on once. Ungating fixes the falsehood:
// the same card now resolves both targets and H19 reports 1 of 2 closed, a
// PARTIAL discharge that says the card may still be legitimately blocked.
//
// But PARTIAL is where H19's duty ends. It reports the block, not the WRITE
// that produced the ambiguity, and it says nothing about which channel is
// carrying the live blocker — so the stale body line survives, and the next
// re-park writes the same shape again. This row is the pair: it names the body
// line as spent, names the live blocker sitting in a comment, and asks for the
// migration. That is what makes the canonical-home doctrine enforced rather
// than merely written down — the failure this whole card measured is a doctrine
// that existed in prose and was not complied with, and prose is what failed.
//
// ## The exact shape, and what it deliberately does NOT fire on
//
// Fires only on the CONJUNCTION: a body-named target that is CLOSED **and** a
// comment-named target, absent from the body, that is OPEN. Each half alone is
// a different, healthy-or-already-reported state:
//
//   - body closed, no live comment target -> H19's ordinary expired block. The
//     line is spent and so is the wait; there is nothing to migrate.
//   - body open + comment open -> two live blockers stated in two channels.
//     Untidy, not wrong, and no row: both are current, and demanding a body
//     rewrite for tidiness would push seats at the very write the comment
//     channel exists to avoid.
//   - a target named in BOTH channels -> not a migration candidate at all; the
//     body already carries it. Only a comment-ONLY live target can be missing
//     from the canonical home.
//   - an UNRESOLVED target on either side is silent here. H19 already fires the
//     unjudged sentence on that card (#4690), and a migration instruction built
//     on a target this sweep could not read would be a guess.
//
// ## Quota
//
// Free. H19 and H26 already hold these resolutions; this row asks the same rows
// a third question — which CHANNEL each target arrived in — which the sweep can
// answer from bodies it has already read.
//
// Report-only. The remedy is a body rewrite by the owning seat; ⛔ never a
// label or a body written from this script.

// H32 — a HELD seat sitting idle over a non-empty lane queue (#11706).
//
// Every other row here watches a CARD or a PR. This one watches the SEAT, and
// it is the first: the patrol could see a card that nobody moved and could not
// see a lane whose seat had stopped moving it. The filing seat reported its own
// defect — it ended round after round with 「要我继续派吗?」 while in-flight was
// zero and 40+ dispatchable cards sat in its queue — against a skill clause that
// already says ⛔ 不等人闸 in as many words. So ⛔ this row adds no prose rule:
// the rule is not missing, the DETECTABILITY was (「规则不缺,措辞也不含糊」).
//
// ## The shape, and why it is the same two-signals-unpaired register as the rest
//
// The board asserts two things that cannot both be healthy: a lane that has
// dispatchable work and nothing in flight, and a seat that declares itself HELD.
// Either one alone is ordinary — an empty lane is a finished lane, and a held
// seat with work in flight is a working seat. Together they say the lane's
// throughput is zero while someone is on the clock for it, which is invisible
// from any single card: every queued card looks exactly like an ordinary queued
// card (that is H30's whole point), and the seat post looks exactly like a seat
// post.
//
// ## The threshold, derived the H30 way — from the measured distribution
//
// Grading declined to let this number be guessed and named the precedent
// (`QUEUE_ROT_STALE_DAYS`, derived from the live queue-age distribution). So it
// is measured, from the quantity the card itself names — the gap between one
// claim and the next on a lane that is working.
//
// Census, 2026-08-25, every `Claim:` comment on the six active objectstack
// lanes' open `pm:dispatched` cards plus the recently-closed window (n = 169
// inter-claim gaps, per-lane then pooled):
//
//   p50 7 min · p75 41 min · p90 324 min · p95 731 min · max 6073 min
//
// The distribution is BIMODAL and reading it as one hump is the trap: inside a
// dispatch wave a seat claims a batch minutes apart (hence p50 = 7), and between
// waves it goes quiet for hours. The upper mode is the one this threshold has to
// clear. Inspected individually, all 12 gaps above 480 min span a shift boundary
// or a night — `domain:devx` 2026-08-19T11:48 → 08-23T17:01, `domain:engine`
// 08-24T15:22 → 08-25T01:47 across a 收班/开轮 pair — i.e. NOT an active seat
// pausing, which is the population this row must never report. Nothing measured
// between waves WITHIN a held shift reached 480.
//
// 480 minutes (8h) therefore sits above the whole measured active-seat tail and
// below the cross-shift band that dominates everything past it. The patrol fires
// four times a day, so an idle seat surfaces on the second sweep after the
// threshold passes — a detection latency well inside the shift it is wasting.
//
// ⚠️ The threshold is the LAST gate, not the main one. Three structural gates in
// front of it do the real narrowing, and they are why this number can be this
// tight without manufacturing accusations. A false 怠工 row costs a working seat
// an argument; a late one costs six hours. The asymmetry is deliberate.
//
// ## Legitimate waits are excluded STRUCTURALLY, never by the threshold
//
// Grading was explicit: a seat whose latest marker names a live blocker (等 CI /
// 等裁决 / 等人工步骤, or an awaiting-class state) is exempt REGARDLESS of
// elapsed time. That is the difference between a seat that is idle and a seat
// that is waiting, and no amount of clock can tell them apart — only the seat's
// own declaration can. So the exemption is a read of the latest marker, and it
// is unbounded: a seat blocked for three days is not reported by this row.

// scoped the work to option 1 executed as a sweep and said in as many words
// that options 2/3 were 「file, don't fold in」; the order forbade the sweep and
// pointed the dev at 2/3. The dev followed the LATER ruling (correct) and
// reported the conflict, seeing one of the three contradictions.
//
// ⛔ Like H32 this adds no rule. The step exists, and the same session had
// already been saved by it twice that day — two cards whose bodies said 「A/B
// 未决」 while triage had long since ruled direction A in a COMMENT. Grading
// declined the other half of the card's remedy menu (a mandatory
// `Prior rulings read:` claim field) on the card's own reasoning: a field 99%
// filled with `none` is ritual, and a ritual field is as untrustworthy as none.
// What it promoted is this — structurally decidable, no threshold, no ritual,
// and silent on the overwhelming majority of cards, which carry no ruling at all.
//
// ## What the row actually asserts, precisely
//
// NOT "the dispatcher failed to read" — that is unobservable. What is observable
// is an ORDERING: the claim that put this card in flight is older than a ruling
// now standing on its thread. The dispatch order therefore cannot carry that
// ruling's constraints, whether it was written blind to a ruling already there
// or overtaken by one posted after. Both readings have the same consequence and
// the same remedy, which is why the row does not try to tell them apart: a dev
// is working from an order that predates the current ruling, and somebody has to
// re-read before the work lands rather than after.
//
// Same two-signals-unpaired register as the rest: a standing ruling and an
// in-flight claim, which should be paired and are not.
//
// ## Measured yield — a LOW-yield row, and silence is its normal reading
//
// Run over the live board on 2026-08-25 it reports NOTHING: of 54 open
// `pm:dispatched` cards, 27 carry no claim this file's marker can read (see
// `latestClaimComment`'s blind-spot note), 4 carry no ruling at all, and on the
// remainder every ruling PRECEDES its claim — which is the healthy ordering and
// exactly what the row wants to see.
//
// That a check reports nothing today is worth distinguishing from a check that
// CANNOT report anything — H30's header makes the point, and it is the reason
// this number was measured rather than assumed. Over the recently-closed window
// the shape is real and rare: 4 of the 107 closed cards carrying a readable
// claim have a ruling posted after it (#11781, #11673, #11106, #10166; the gaps
// run 8 min to ~17 h). So the expected steady state is a quiet row that fires a
// few times a week, in H23's register (~6 in 1,546) rather than H30's.

 * of 19 canonical claim comments, 3 name no protocol-shaped branch, and on 3
 * cards this row reads a claim `governingClaim` cannot (「Claim: PM loop round 1
 * (QA wave #9296)」 is one). What this row needs from a claim is only WHEN it
 * was written.
 *
 * ⛔ A second specimen used to stand beside the first — 「Claim pointer: folded
 * into the 11678 family dispatch」, offered as another well-formed branchless
 * claim. It is not one, and it is not in this row's population at all:
 * `CLAIM_COMMENT_MARKER` wants the colon directly after the word, and here the
 * word is followed by ` pointer`, so the marker has never matched it. Under the
 * same 2026-08-11 ruling that governs the dash spellings it is a MALFORMED
 * claim — and unlike those it is invisible to H34 as well, which reports only a
 * punctuation separator (that gap was measured and deliberately left open; see
 * H34's header). The paragraph's conclusion is unaffected: it rests on the
 * first specimen, which is real, and on the live count above.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The inherited blind spot, and what it is NOT (#12090)
 *
 * `CLAIM_COMMENT_MARKER` requires the canonical colon, and some live claims are
 * written with an em dash instead (「Claim — <seat>, session …」), which the
 * marker does not match. Those cards are invisible to this row.
 *
 * ⛔ They are NOT well-formed claims in a dialect this file fails to read. The
 * maintainer's 2026-08-11 ruling makes the literal `Claim:` the single machine
 * criterion and closes the widening explicitly (SKILL.md step 4, quoted in full
 * at `CLAIM_COMMENT_MARKER`), so a dash-written claim is MALFORMED and the
 * repair is the write side. This paragraph used to call them 「real claims,
 * correctly formed」 — a straight contradiction of the protocol this file
 * enforces, and the exact shape of drift the strictness exists to prevent.
 *
 * Inherited on purpose rather than patched here. Defining a second, WIDER
 * notion of "a claim" for H33 alone would leave the file disagreeing with
 * itself about what a claim IS — H2 would go on calling those cards claimless
 * while H33 read their claims off the same threads — and a file that
 * contradicts itself about its own vocabulary is a worse defect than the gap.
 * The consequence here is UNDER-reporting, which is the direction this file
 * takes on every unrecognised spelling (H17's extractor, H20's branch shape),
 * never a fabricated row.
 *
 * Where those claims DO surface is H34, which reports the near miss as its own
 * observation and points the seat at the canonical spelling — visibility
 * without redefining the vocabulary.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// H34 — a claim-shaped comment with a NON-CANONICAL SEPARATOR (#12090).
//
// The card that filed this measured 24 of 54 open `pm:dispatched` cards
// carrying 「Claim — <seat>, session …」 with an EM DASH, invisible to
// `CLAIM_COMMENT_MARKER`, and proposed widening the class. That proposal is
// CLOSED, and this row is what was taken instead.
//
// ## Why the predicate is not widened — the ruling, verbatim
//
// `.claude/skills/pm-dispatch/SKILL.md` (step 4 of the claim protocol) records
// 「首行以字面 `Claim:` 开头是机器判据(维护者 2026-08-11 裁定;巡查谓词只认这
// 一个拼写且保持严格,修法是全舰队向文档拼写收敛,⛔ 不放宽谓词)」. Under that
// ruling a dash-written claim is a MALFORMED claim, H2's row on it is a CORRECT
// report, and the repair is the write side converging on the documented
// spelling. Widening the reader would make the enforced protocol drift away
// from the written one permanently — the declared-≠-enforced shape this repo
// treats as a defect everywhere else — and would do it by editing a maintainer
// ruling's own text, which is not a patrol script's call.
//
// ## …and why the gap is nevertheless real, which is what this row closes
//
// The cost the card found is not only H2's loudness. `governingClaim` gates on
// the same marker before reading `Branch:`, so a card claimed with a dash buys
// no ref probe and can never produce an H20 「no remote ref」 or H27 「dead
// claim」 row: it sits OUTSIDE dispatch-liveness entirely, silently, for as long
// as it is in flight. H33 inherits the same blindness. So the malformed claim
// costs one noisy row and three quiet ones, and the quiet ones are the
// expensive direction.
//
// This row makes the malformed spelling VISIBLE without redefining what a claim
// is. `Claim:` stays the single machine criterion — H2/H20/H27/H33 are
// untouched, byte for byte — and the near miss is reported as its own,
// separately-named observation whose remedy points at the canonical spelling.
// The file therefore never disagrees with itself about its own vocabulary,
// which is the objection that kept the gap open.
//
// ## Measured, fresh, at dispatch time (2026-08-25 ~15:00Z)
//
// Over the LIVE open `pm:dispatched` population (45 cards): 40 colon-form,
// 1 dash-only, 0 hyphen, 0 fullwidth, 4 with no claim in any spelling. The
// filing card's 24-of-54 has already decayed to 1-of-45 in a day — the
// maintainer's prescribed convergence is working, which is precisely why the
// widening was not worth a ruling. Over the 128 `pm:dispatched` cards closed
// since 2026-08-24 the shape is recurring rather than historical: 13 dash-only
// claims, clustered in identifiable seat batches. So this row's expected steady
// state is quiet — H23's register, not H30's — and its value is that a seat
// writing the wrong spelling learns about it while the card is still in flight,
// which is how a fleet converges.
//
// ## Deliberately NOT the whole near-miss space
//
// Two suppressions, both under-reporting on purpose (H17's and H20's standing
// direction — a fabricated row sends a reader to check something that was never
// there):
//
//   • A thread that ALSO carries a canonical claim is silent here. That card is
//     machine-visible, so the row would have no remedy to offer. The residual
//     it accepts: a RE-claim written with a dash over an older colon claim
//     leaves `governingClaim` reading the stale one. Narrower than the shape
//     this row is for, and naming it would cost a row on every card that ever
//     wrote a dash claim once.
//   • A claim-shaped line whose remainder carries none of the protocol's own
//     content (a session reference, the word "seat", or a protocol-shaped
//     branch anywhere in the comment) is silent. 「Claim - see above」 in prose
//     is not evidence that a claim was attempted.
//
// ## The WORD position — measured 2026-08-27, and NOT widened
//
// A filed finding asked whether the separator class should cover a WORD where
// the punctuation goes, on the strength of 「Claim pointer: folded into the
// 11678 family dispatch」 — a string `latestClaimComment`'s header cited as a
// claim the marker reads, which it never was. Measured before answering,
// because the header above says this row's strictness was paid for once and
// a widening is exactly what it was paid to prevent.
//
// The census: 161 pm-tracked cards — 13 open `pm:dispatched`, 76 open
// `pm:queue`, 72 `pm:dispatched` closed since 2026-08-26 — and all 343 comments
// on them, classified by what follows a line-opening claim word. 19 canonical
// `Claim:`; 2 with a declared punctuation separator (both EM DASH, both on
// threads with no canonical claim — this row's live population, and it fires);
// and ZERO with a distinct word in the separator position. The 「Claim pointer:」
// specimen occurs nowhere on the board: its only live instance is the finding
// card quoting this file quoting it.
//
// So the widening buys nothing measurable, and it would spend the conservative
// half's whole margin to buy it. `Claim` followed by a word is ordinary English
// — 「Claiming this card」, 「Claim comments are …」 — where `Claim` followed by
// an em dash is not; `looksLikeClaimContent` would carry that load for a
// population of zero. RECORDED, NOT WIDENED.
//
// The same census found three OTHER shapes invisible to both markers, recorded
// so a later reader can reopen the question on numbers instead of re-measuring
// — and each is already harmless for a DIFFERENT reason, which is the actual
// finding:
//
//   • 2 「Claim (dev): …」 openings. Both threads ALSO carry a canonical claim,
//     so the first suppression above already covers them: they are a SECOND
//     claim comment on a machine-visible card, never a substitute for one.
//   • 2 inflected openings (「Claiming this card. session …」) and 1 decorated
//     with backticks (「`Claim:` devx@objectstack seat …」). All three sit on
//     UNASSIGNED cards, which this row and H2 both decline to judge — the
//     residual already declared above.
//
// Three different shapes, three different reasons, none of them this one. Each
// is its own question with its own noise floor if it ever acquires a population.

// H35 — a gate label REMOVED with no matching review-chain evidence (#11881).
//
// H31 above compares the gate's two carriers as they stand NOW and says, in its
// own header, exactly what it cannot do: 「闸门被剥不是红灯是放行」 — a stripped
// gate is a GREEN light, and 「被剥」 and 「从未挂过」 are indistinguishable in
// the evidence. A label that was removed is ABSENT, and absence has two causes.
// Every reader in this file until now has been a reader of STATE, so none of
// them can separate the two. This row reads the EVENT that produced the state.
//
// The filing card's measurement is what makes the question concrete: on PR
// #11470 the erasing actor was a SEAT (`claude[bot]`, 33 and 92 minutes after
// the Auto Label job), not a workflow — so the whole-set-PUT gate that shipped
// for that incident sweeps `.github/workflows/**`, `.github/actions/**` and
// `scripts/**` and cannot reach the actor at all. Seats write through the API at
// runtime. The compensating control the card asks for is DETECTION, and the
// triage ruling (2026-08-25 14:58Z) scoped this card to exactly that: a
// report-only patrol, adding detection and weakening no gate. ⛔ Escalation and
// enforcement are a LATER card and deliberately absent here.
//
// ## The transport, and why this row costs no per-card fetch
//
// The obvious reading — fetch each card's timeline — is the trade this sweep
// declines everywhere it arises (H15 declines it by name for the age of a
// label; H16's header forbids "fixing" its proxy with one). This row does not
// need it. `GET /repos/{repo}/issues/events` is a REPO-WIDE, newest-first
// stream of the same `labeled`/`unlabeled` rows, and it carries the full issue
// payload — number, state, CURRENT labels, body — on every row. So the whole
// population is one paginated window of the shape this file already keeps three
// of (H8's merged-PR window, H23's commit window, H22's closed-issue window),
// and the per-card cost is zero. PRs arrive through it too: a pull request IS
// an issue to this endpoint, which is what lets one window see both carriers of
// a dual-carrier gate.
//
// MEASURED 2026-08-26T01:26:58Z, 160 pages: 16,000 events spanning
// 2026-08-22T15:35:07Z … 2026-08-26T01:26:58Z = 3.41 days ⇒ ~4,691 events/day.
//
// ## What counts as "matching review-chain evidence" — and why it is STRUCTURAL
//
// `references/contract-review.md` names the evidence for a legitimate clear:
// 「PASS 评论 + 标签缺失 + PR head 自复审后未动 = 已复审清标,不是被剥」. Read
// literally that makes the discriminator a PASS COMMENT, and a predicate built
// on it does not survive measurement. The verdicts are free prose and their
// wording varies card to card — `**Contract review: PASS**`,
// `**Contract review — PASS**`, `## Post-merge contract-review verdict: **PASS**`
// were all live in one 18-hour window — so over the 35 card-side removals in
// that window a strict marker matched 5 and a loose one matched 10. Widening
// the regex until the rest match is the tolerant-consumer antipattern this repo
// forbids by name, and its end state is worse than noise: an "any PASS token"
// reading matched 26 of 35, including threads whose PASS was about something
// else entirely — a check that can barely fail, which is the shape this file
// exists to CATCH rather than to add.
//
// The protocol leaves a second, MACHINE-READABLE definition of the same event,
// and this row uses that one: 「PR 与卡双载体同笔挂」…「PASS 双载体同笔清标」 —
// the gate is hung in one stroke and cleared in one stroke, ACROSS BOTH
// CARRIERS. A legitimate clear therefore leaves TWO removals, one per carrier,
// seconds apart, by the same actor. A strip leaves ONE. That is a structural
// invariant taken from the protocol's own words, not a parse of prose, and it
// is the reason this row can decline the comment fetch as well as the timeline
// fetch.
//
// ## The stroke window, derived from the measured gap distribution
//
// Same corpus, 206 gate removals: for each, the gap to the nearest removal on
// the OPPOSITE carrier kind by the SAME actor.
//
//   ≤1s  50 | ≤2s  65 | ≤3s   5 | ≤5s  21 | ≤10s 16 | ≤30s 11 | ≤60s  4
//   (60,90]s  0   ← the distribution is EMPTY here
//   ≤120s 4 | ≤300s 1 | then 1000s, 3344s, … hours
//
// The same-stroke cluster ends at 101s and the next observation is 275s — a
// 2.7x jump across an empty region. `H35_SAME_STROKE_SECONDS = 120` sits inside
// that gap, so the threshold is a reading rather than a preference: no value
// between 102 and 274 classifies the corpus differently. The tail past 120s is
// hours wide, which is a different stroke by any reading. The batching is why
// the cluster has width at all — the review Routine runs hourly and 「每小时一轮
// 即天然攒批」, and a measured batch cleared 4 PRs + 4 cards in 14 seconds.
//
// ## Three outcomes, never two (#4690)
//
// A lone removal is NOT automatically a strip, and the corpus says so loudly.
// 34 of 36 lone removals were gates that had been hung on the CARD ONLY — the
// PR carrier never carried the label at all (verified per-PR: PR #12401 and PR
// #12287, the two most recent, have zero gate events in their entire history).
// For a single-carrier gate there is no second carrier to clear, so a lone
// clear is exactly what a CORRECT clear looks like, and flagging it would
// report the majority shape of the board as a violation.
//
// So the removal is judged against its own HANG, which the same window already
// carries: a gate hung in a dual stroke and cleared in a lone one is the pair
// written half way — that is the finding. A gate hung lone and cleared lone is
// internally consistent and gets the file's UNJUDGED treatment instead of a
// verdict: there is no structural evidence in EITHER direction, which is not
// the same as evidence of correctness, and 「read, and it carries nothing」 vs
// 「could not be read」 is the pair this whole file refuses to conflate. A
// removal whose hang predates the window is `undated` and is counted, never
// guessed at.
//
// ⚠️ The unjudgeable class is the honest residue of this card, and it is the
// LARGER half: measured 29 over 3.41 days against 0 half-writes. Where the
// dual-carrier discipline is actually followed it holds — 0 half-write clears
// in 206 removals — and the exposure has moved to single-carrier gates, which
// no carrier comparison (H31's or this one's) can ever adjudicate. Closing THAT
// half needs a producer-side change (a canonical machine-readable verdict, or
// the PR-side hang that 「PR 一存在即挂」 already requires), which is a decision
// this row records rather than takes.
//
// ## What is reported, and the deliberate asymmetry in the two classes
//
// `half-write` is reported for any carrier, open or closed: a gate cleared half
// way on a PR that then merged is the bypass that already happened, and the
// population is ~0/day so it cannot flood the report. `unjudgeable` is reported
// only while the carrier is still OPEN and the label still ABSENT — that is the
// subset a reader can still act on, and it is the difference between 0.22 rows
// per run and 8.5. Measured live subset: 3 cards over 3.41 days.
//
// A removal whose label is back is SILENT in both classes. That is the
// read-back working — the card's own §2 names the 13-minute re-application on
// #11470 as「consistent with an accidental loss caught by read-back」— and a row
// for it would report the control functioning as a defect.
//
// Report-only, and emphatically: like H31 this row's subject is a GATE. ⛔ Never
// a label written from this script — a sweeper that re-hung a review gate would
// be issuing the review verdict, which is 自查放行.

// What is unheld is LEGIBILITY: the same-file fence lives in a claim comment
// in one lane's thread, so a second seat that never asks the cross-lane
// question gets no signal from anywhere. The platform volunteers nothing
// either: `mergeable_state` stayed `unknown` throughout (computed lazily), so
// the seat's first reading was wrong and it armed auto-merge on a dirty head.
//
// ## What this row is — patrol INPUT, never a verdict
//
// A pair sharing a changed file is often perfectly fine (the incident's own
// two sides were additive and semantically safe). The row does not judge the
// pair; it makes the hold visible on the anchor every seat already reads, so
// the cross-lane walk the claim shape requires has a mechanical backstop for
// the case where a seat skipped or misjudged it — which is exactly the
// two-possibility fork the incident could not distinguish after the fact.
// Report-only like everything here: the remedy is a PROBE — fetch the PR ref,
// `git merge-tree --write-tree` against today's main answers "would this land
// clean" for free — never a label and never a gate.
//
// ## Why "ACCEPTED/armed" gates the row
//
// A pair of unarmed drafts is ordinary concurrent work-in-progress; the walk
// at their own dispatch time is the instrument for that. The board state
// worth a standing row is the incident's: a side that is DONE — ready
// (= reviewed by construction here: dev PRs flip ready only at review
// ACCEPT) or armed — can be silently passed by the other side landing first,
// after which every proxy signal reads healthy while it rots. `auto_merge`
// is read in the finding-INCREASING direction only, H16's argument exactly:
// arming resolves no conflict, so an armed side is more at risk, not handled.
//
// ## The noise floor is CLOSED, and argued from the single-claim gate's data
//
// That gate's header measured shared-changed-path collisions over ~650 PRs:
// the top repo-wide pairs are the lock file (33), a plugin manifest (21) and
// the root manifest (15) — ordinary concurrent work in a repo taking ~18
// merges a day. Pairing on those would put a row on the anchor every sweep
// and bury the one that matters. So exactly two spellings are excluded, both
// shared BY CONSTRUCTION, and the closed set is pinned by the self-test
// against per-incident growth (the discipline `SINGLE_CLAIM_PATHS` applies
// to itself): the pnpm lockfile (touched by any PR moving dependencies, and
// merged mechanically) and `.changeset/` (every PR ADDS a uniquely-named
// file there — a collision on one is not a source-file hold).
// `changeset-release/*` PRs are excluded as CANDIDATES for the matching
// reason: the Version Packages PR consumes every changeset file on the
// board, so it would pair with essentially every open PR, and it is
// regenerated from `main` on every push — it holds nothing.
//
// ## Bounded, and bounded honestly
//
// The files fetch is ONE page per candidate, candidates being the open PRs
// this sweep already listed — bounded by the open population (~19 at the
// reading this landed on). A PR with more changed files than the page has
// the tail unread: that can only MISS a pair, never invent one, and both the
// summary line's `read X of Y` and a per-row truncation sentence say so.
// Positive evidence only — this row never asserts "no overlap".

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// H37 — a FAMILY DISPATCH whose per-member label writes did not all land
// (#12629).
//
// ## The incident, and the exact reason nothing said so
//
// A family dispatch folds N already-triaged cards into ONE dev run: one shared
// branch named after the CHAIN HEAD, one worktree, one PR — and one
// `pm:dispatched` write PER MEMBER. Those writes are N separate calls with
// nothing tying them together, so a partial run is possible and produced no
// signal at all. Measured on the filing seat's own error: in a 3-card fold it
// wrote 2 of the 3, leaving one member carrying a member-pointer claim comment
// naming the chain head while its label still read `pm:queue`.
//
// That combination is a lie in the DISPATCHABLE direction — the queue label
// says "free to claim" about a card a fold already holds — and every per-card
// predicate in this file reads it as clean, CORRECTLY:
//
//   - H1/H2/H3/H24/H29 key on `assignee` x label x claim-comment pairings ON
//     ONE CARD. That card had no assignee and a consistent-looking `pm:queue`.
//   - The fold's own record lives in the CHAIN HEAD's claim comment, on
//     another card. Nothing joined the two.
//   - The seat's in-flight ledger is its seat post, which lists the fold by
//     its HEAD.
//
// The mirror direction is measured too, on this card's own grading round:
// #12200 was left `pm:dispatched` WITH its assignee after the fold's recovery
// had declared release — the same non-atomic write failing the other way, and
// equally invisible until a seat happened to look. Both directions are rows
// here, because a predicate that reported only the first would have said
// nothing about the second instance on the very card that filed it.
//
// ## The join, and why the BRANCH is the whole of it
//
// The fold convention (SKILL.md, step 4 -> 家族派发的折叠认领约定) is:
//
//     共享分支按链首卡命名,每张成员卡各留认领评论并点名该分支
//
// — the shared branch is named for the chain head, and EVERY member card
// leaves its own claim comment naming that branch (a member with no branch of
// its own is the design, not a half-state). So the fold's roster is already
// written on the board in a machine-readable field: the `Branch:` directive
// this file has read since H20, through `claimedBranches` / `governingClaim`.
//
// A card whose governing claim names `claude/issue-H-...` with H NOT its own
// number IS the member pointer, and a branch carrying at least one such
// claimant IS a live fold. That single reading covers BOTH halves the filing
// card asks to join — 「a member pointer on this card」 and 「named as a member
// in a live `Claim:` on another open card」 — because the shared branch is the
// one string both of them spell, and each member's claim names it.
//
// ⛔ No prose scraping, deliberately. A claim comment names sibling cards,
// serial-constraint predecessors and blocker targets as bare `#N` in its own
// text — the specimen on this row's own filing card names the chain that HELD
// this script — so scanning claim prose for card numbers would manufacture
// members out of the one field the protocol fills in correctly. H20's header
// makes the same call about branch spellings, for the same reason: a fabricated
// row sends a reader to check something that was never there.
//
// ## What the row compares, in BOTH directions
//
// Per fold, the HEAD's own state says whether the fold is in flight, and every
// other claimant is read against it:
//
//   head `pm:dispatched`         -> IN FLIGHT. A claimant without
//                                   `pm:dispatched` is a missed write — the
//                                   filing seat's own error.
//   head CLOSED, or open without -> RELEASED. A claimant still carrying
//   `pm:dispatched`                 `pm:dispatched` is residue — #12200's
//                                   mirror.
//   head open + undispatched,    -> the HEAD's own half of the write is the one
//   some claimant dispatched        that missed. The row lands on the head, and
//                                   it is visible from the members' claims and
//                                   from nothing else on the board.
//   head in neither population   -> UNRESOLVABLE, and the row DECLINES rather
//                                   than picking a side (H19's call).
//
// A fold in which NOTHING is dispatched — head included — is deliberately
// quiet. It is indistinguishable from an abandoned or not-yet-launched fold,
// and those cards are already H30's population on their own terms.
// Under-report over fabricate is this file's standing direction.
//
// ## The noise floor is CLOSED, and it is the ordinary case
//
// Exactly ONE exclusion, and it covers essentially the whole board: a claim
// naming its OWN card's branch is not fold evidence. Every solo dispatch here
// writes exactly that, so without the exclusion this row would fire on every
// dispatched card in existence. A branch is a fold branch only when some
// claimant is not its head. ⛔ Nothing else is suppressed by name — this row
// carries no per-incident exclusion list to grow, which is the discipline H36's
// closed noise floor states and `SINGLE_CLAIM_PATHS` applies to itself.
//
// ## Bounded, and bounded honestly
//
// Round 1 is FREE. It reads the claim threads this sweep ALREADY holds: every
// open `pm:dispatched` card (the dispatch-liveness loop) and every assigned
// pm-tracked card (H2's fetch). So fold DISCOVERY converges on the open
// `pm:dispatched` population, exactly as the filing card bounds it — a fold
// with a dispatched member announces itself there at no cost.
//
// Round 2 buys ONE comment page per open `pm:queue` card, and ONLY when round 1
// actually saw a live fold. A board with no fold in flight therefore costs
// NOTHING, and a board with one costs at most the queue page count (40 open
// `pm:queue` cards at the 2026-08-24 census H30 measured, against a 15,000/h
// core quota and four sweeps a day). It is bought for `pm:queue` because that
// is precisely where the dispatchable-direction lie parks — a card the queue
// offers while a fold already holds it — and it is the one population whose
// threads no other item here reads.
//
// Positive evidence only. A member page that fails drops that card out of the
// roster — a MISS, never an invention — and the coverage pair reports it, with
// an all-failed pass named in the summary as the transport it is (#4690). The
// pass does NOT rethrow, unlike H16's and H36's: those rows ARE their detail
// pass, while two of this row's three directions are free and already gathered,
// so discarding the sweep would cost more readings than it protects. ⛔ This
// row never asserts that a fold's writes all landed.
//
// Report-only like everything here: the remedy is a seat re-reading the fold's
// members and writing the missing half. ⛔ Never a label written from this
// script.

 * own card's row, never dropped」 — and on the 2026-08-25T02:08Z sweep it was
 * not true. That run resolved 25 of 28 targets and rendered FIVE H19 rows, all
 * of them same-repo and closed-led; not one carried an unresolved target,
 * because the markdown body ran out of budget and 199 rows were trimmed. The
 * rows the header promised were never dropped had been dropped, by the trim,
 * while the header went on promising it.
 *
 * That is precisely #4690 wearing this item's own uniform: "could not read the
 * input" rendered as clean, inside the mechanism built to stop exactly that. A
 * reader could not have caught it either — the trimmed rows announce themselves
 * only as a COUNT, so 「199 further row(s) omitted」 and 「every unresolved target
 * is named」 sat in one body, contradicting each other, with nothing to say which
 * was true.
 *
 * The fix is ordering, not budget: unjudged rows sort ahead of judged ones, so
 * the trim can only ever fall on rows that DID make a determination. Judged rows
 * are recoverable from the run log and say so; an unjudged one is the report's
 * only trace of a gap in what was read. This is the same reservation
 * `renderTriggerIndex` gets and for the same reason — a section whose absence is
 * indistinguishable from good news must not be what the trim eats.

 *
 * ## Why this is a list and not eleven hand-written lines
 *
 * It used to be eleven hand-written lines, and two of them were missing.
 * `dispatchRefTargets`/`dispatchRefRead` were computed by the H20/H27 pass and
 * never copied into `counts`, so the dispatch-liveness clause rendered
 * `read on 0 of 0` on every live sweep from the day it was added — the
 * 2026-08-25T02:08Z run said it had read no branch at all while publishing two
 * H20 findings, which only a non-empty ref cache can produce.
 *
 * The failure is invisible by construction: `counts.x ?? 0` renders a missing
 * key and a genuine zero identically, and a genuine zero is a legitimate
 * reading ("nothing to probe this sweep"). So the coverage pair — the mechanism
 * whose entire job is to prove a pass examined something — was the one thing in
 * the report that could go quiet without any evidence that it had. #4690,
 * wearing the uniform of the check built to prevent it.
 *
 * Enumerating the keys makes the assembly mechanical: `sweep()` copies THIS
 * list, so adding a counter to `stats` and forgetting to forward it is no
 * longer possible, and the self-test can assert the contract directly rather
 * than re-deriving it from a rendered sentence.

 * nothing in the file said so, because nothing in the file could: the
 * arithmetic was prose, so no reader and no test could ever disagree with it.
 *

 * when it matters.
 *
 * ## The boundary, re-derived (#11118)
 *
 * The cap was two pages, justified by a sentence claiming they "reach well past
 * the longest measured unexecuted-verdict latency" — true at ~18 merges/day,
 * which is where that sentence came from, and false at the measured 137.5.
 * Both readings, taken 2026-08-23T08:42:15Z over the live endpoint:
 *
 *   2 pages = 200 rows -> 197 merged, oldest merge 2026-08-21T14:00:28Z = 1.78d
 *   4 pages = 400 rows -> 397 merged, oldest merge 2026-08-20T09:41:02Z = 2.96d
 *
 * (Derivation and reading agree: `windowCoverageDays(400, 137.5)` = 2.91d. The
 * merged-only filter costs almost nothing — 397 of 400 closed PRs in the window
 * were merged — so rows and merges are interchangeable here in practice.)
 *
 * Four pages is chosen over an honest restatement because this row's damage
 * model is asymmetric in the direction that punishes a short window: H8 reports
 * a card whose delivering PR merged while the card still says `pm:dispatched`,
 * i.e. precisely the paired write NOBODY noticed — which correlates with age.
 * The population most likely to age out is the population the row exists for.
 * The measured H8 specimen (#11036) sat unreported ~22h, so a 1.78-day window
 * left the row about 2x its own worst measured latency; 2.96 days restores the
 * "comfortably past it" the docblock always claimed. Cost: two extra requests
 * per sweep, four sweeps a day, against a 15,000/h core quota.
 *
 * At the 6-hourly cadence that is `sweepOverlap(2.96)` ≈ 11.8 consecutive runs
 * that see a given merge — the window is a detection HORIZON, not a retry
 * budget: past it the finding is not delayed, it is gone (H22 catches the part
 * of that population whose card later closes; nothing catches the rest).

/**
 * The bounded closed-card window H22 reads (#10688) — most recently UPDATED
 * closed issues, capped at two pages, the same `sort=updated` convention and

 *
 * The cap is the item's stated boundary, and here it carries more weight than
 * usual: the label-scoped population of closed carriers is very large (a
 * 2026-08-22 re-measure paged past 500 closed `pm:dispatched` carriers alone
 * and was still going, because the label has been applied since the protocol
 * began and dropped only sporadically). Reporting all of them would drown every
 * other item in one-time historical residue. So this window deliberately
 * reports the RECENT residue — the population where the paired write is still
 * a live duty someone remembers — and the deep tail is a backfill question,
 * not a patrol question. `state=closed` is the ONLY closed-issue read in this
 * file; every other collector stays open-only by construction.
 *
 * ## The boundary, re-derived — and the surprise in it (#11118)
 *
 * "Recent" was never measured here; it was assumed to mean roughly what H8's
 * window meant. It did not, and the divisor is the reason: this window is
 * ordered by `updated`, and a closed card is BUMPED by every later comment,
 * label write and cross-reference, so the rows are consumed by issue ACTIVITY
 * rather than by closures. Read 2026-08-23T08:42:15Z over the live endpoint:
 *
 *   2 pages = 200 rows -> updated 2026-08-22T17:05:44Z … 2026-08-23T08:39:14Z
 *                         = 0.65d (~15.6 HOURS of update-recency)
 *   4 pages = 400 rows -> updated 2026-08-21T15:44:49Z … 2026-08-23T08:39:14Z
 *                         = 1.70d
 *
 * At 6-hourly runs the old cap gave `sweepOverlap(0.65)` ≈ 2.6 consecutive
 * sweeps — and the derived floor is tighter still (200 rows / ~308 updates/day
 * ≈ 1.30d for four pages against the 1.70d measured), because the rate is
 * BURSTY: a triage round that touches a few hundred closed cards can eject a
 * fresh residue card inside one cadence, and it does so exactly when residue is
 * being produced fastest. That correlation is what makes 2.6 sweeps thin rather
 * than merely small.
 *
 * Four pages restores what the anti-drowning argument above was actually
 * choosing — a couple of days of recent residue — rather than the fifteen hours
 * it turned out to be buying. It does NOT reopen the deep tail: the population
 * that argument refuses is the 500+ historical carriers spanning months, and
 * 1.7 days is not in it. Cost: two extra requests per sweep.

 *
 * ## The measurement (objectui, 2026-08-24, re-measured for this port)
 *
 *   closed cards carrying `pm:dispatched`, repo-wide          815
 *   closed issues in this window (4 pages = 400 rows)         400
 *     …spanning updated 2026-08-18T03:36:15Z … 08-24T09:48Z   6.2 days
 *   of those 400, carrying a `PM_RESIDUE_LABELS` member:
 *     `pm:dispatched`                                         259
 *     `pm:queue`                                               86
 *     `pm:blocked`                                              1
 *     `pm:on-hold`                                              1
 *                                                       ≈ 347 rows
 *
 * Upstream measured 129 of 500 (26%) and called that recent residue a live
 * duty. Here it is ~87% of the window. That inversion is not this repo being
 * behind on a chore — it is that stripping `pm:*` on close was never this
 * lane's practice (objectui#5791's own thread records two seats reading the
 * same corpus and landing on opposite conventions). A row that fires on ~87%
 * of everything it reads is not a finding, it is the convention restated 347
 * times, and it would consume the entire `MARKDOWN_BODY_BUDGET` and trim every
 * OTHER predicate's rows out of the anchor body — the patrol dead on arrival,
 * which is precisely what this card exists to prevent.
 *
 * So the window is PARAMETERISED rather than the predicate edited: `h22ClosedCardPmResidue`
 * is untouched and still correct, and this install simply does not open the
 * closed reader. `PM_SWEEP_CLOSED_WINDOW_PAGES=0` disables it; unset keeps
 * upstream's 4, so the file's DEFAULT behaviour is byte-identical to objectstack
 * and a future verbatim re-sync of the predicate cannot silently re-enable
 * anything — the choice lives in the workflow, where it is one visible line.
 *
 * ⛔ Disabling is NOT the same as reading clean, and `summaryLine` says so in
 * the rendered body rather than reporting `read 0` (#4690: an input that was
 * never read must never render as an input that was read and found clean).
 * Re-enabling is a BACKFILL decision — strip the historical residue first, then
 * drop the variable — and never a quiet default flip.

/**
 * H22's DATED CLOSURE FLOOR — the cutover date at and after which a closed
 * card's `pm:*` residue is judged (objectui#5985).
 *
 * ## The dilemma this dissolves
 *
 * The window above is bounded by UPDATE recency, which is the wrong axis for
 * the one question a sibling install kept running into: "was this card closed
 * under the convention, or before it existed?" Measured in objectui
 * 2026-08-24, while porting this file: 815 closed cards there carry
 * `pm:dispatched`, and ~347 of the 400 issues in the window above carry some
 * `pm:*` residue (~87%, against the 26% this repo measured on its own board).
 * At that density H22 reports the CONVENTION rather than a defect — ~347 rows
 * that exhaust the anchor body budget and trim every other predicate's
 * findings out of the report. That install therefore shipped with the closed
 * reader switched off, and its card recorded the choice as a two-way one:
 * either stripping is the rule (and ~815 cards need a BACKFILL before H22 can
 * be honest) or it is not (and H22 is simply not a predicate that repo wants).
 *
 * The floor is the third option both readings omit. `pm:*` on a card closed
 * before the convention was written is inert history: nothing queries it as a
 * claim of in-flight-ness, because the loop reads state on OPEN cards only
 * (`is:open` is in every one of its inventory queries). Judging only cards
 * closed on/after a cutover date therefore buys the row's whole value — the
 * residue produced from now on, while the paired write is still a live duty
 * someone remembers — at zero backfill and zero historical noise. ⛔ The
 * alternative this file must never grow is a bulk label rewrite of closed
 * cards: 815 mutating writes to make a report quieter is machinery serving the
 * instrument, and no code path here writes a label at all.
 *
 * ## Default: unset, which is exactly today's behaviour
 *
 * An install that wants every card in the window judged sets nothing, and this
 * resolver returns a null floor that the predicate ignores. That keeps this
 * repo's own patrol byte-identical across this change — it measured 26% and
 * treats recent closed residue as a live duty — and makes the floor a
 * per-install adaptation rather than a policy shipped to everyone.
 *
 * ## Malformed is REFUSED, never defaulted
 *
 * A typo'd floor that silently became "no floor" would restore the 87% flood
 * on the one install that set it, four times a day, and the flood reads as a
 * working patrol — the same trap `resolveSweepRepo` refuses by name. So an
 * unparseable value is `valid: false` and the entrypoint exits 2 on it. Only
 * the `YYYY-MM-DD` spelling is accepted: a bare `Date` parse would take
 * "yesterday-ish" strings and timezone-bearing ones whose midnight is not the
 * one the workflow author meant, and the value is written by hand in a
 * workflow file exactly once.

 * `readTrackedFiles` proves a git channel exists here, and a `git log` read
 * would cost no API quota at all — so the choice needs a reason. It is the
 * runner: `.github/workflows/half-state-patrol.yml` checks out with
 * `actions/checkout@v7` and no `fetch-depth`, whose default is **1**. `git log`
 * there would read exactly ONE commit message and report a clean surface, which
 * is #4690 in its purest form — an unread input rendering as a clean one, four
 * times a day, forever. This is not a hypothetical about someone else's
 * container: the checkout this change was authored in arrived shallow at 375
 * commits, and the 11-day corpus in H23's section only became readable after an
 * explicit `git fetch --deepen`. A channel that is dark in the one place the
 * sweep actually runs is not a cheaper channel.
 *
 * ## The page cap, in the units that decide it
 *
 * Measured over the corpus above: 1,546 commits in 11.7 days ≈ 132/day. Three
 * pages ≈ 300 commits ≈ 2.3 days, against a patrol that fires every 6 hours —
 * roughly a 9× overlap, so a message has to survive nine consecutive sweeps to
 * age out unseen.
 *
 * RE-MEASURED 2026-08-23T08:42:15Z and unchanged, which is why this window
 * alone kept its cap while H8's and H22's were widened (#11118): the same three
 * pages read 300 commits spanning 2026-08-21T04:00:19Z … 2026-08-23T08:22:47Z
 * = 2.18 days at ~137.5/day, i.e. `sweepOverlap(2.18)` ≈ 8.7 runs. This item's
 * docblock was the only one that DERIVED its cap from a measured rate instead
 * of quoting a remembered one, and it is the only one that survived contact
 * with a re-measure — the argument for keeping the derivation executable
 * (`windowCoverageDays`, `MEASURED_MERGES_PER_DAY`) rather than in prose.
 *
 * No `sha=` parameter: the endpoint defaults to the repository's own default
 * branch, which keeps this reader repo-agnostic exactly like every other listing
 * here — `PM_SWEEP_REPO` can name a repo whose default branch is not `main`.
 * Ordering is the endpoint's own reverse-chronological walk of that branch and
 * needs no first-parent filter here: `main` is linear (measured — 1,975 commits
 * reachable, 1,975 on the first-parent walk, 0 merge commits), so the commit list
 * and the squash-message list are the same list. A repo that DOES carry merge
 * commits would simply feed this row a few branch-side messages, which are a
 * surface GitHub's parser reads too — wider, never wrong.
