/**
 * objectui#8885 — `drillDown`, `title` and `compareTo` are declared on BOTH
 * published copies of `ObjectChartSchema` (the TS interface in `../objectql.ts`
 * and the zod mirror in `../zod/objectql.zod.ts`), each bound to the
 * `@objectstack/spec` symbol that already owns it.
 *
 * ## The class
 *
 * objectui#6914: a key read behind a cast and declared on neither published
 * face. `ObjectChart.tsx` read all three off `schema` while both faces stayed
 * silent, so they rode `BaseSchema`'s `[key: string]: any` / `.passthrough()`
 * and arrived UNVALIDATED. `drillDown` was the sharpest instance — this
 * component's registry `inputs` advertise it to the designer palette AND
 * `@objectstack/spec` publishes `ChartDrillDownSchema` for exactly this
 * carrier, so an author was offered a key that neither published shape
 * mentioned.
 *
 * ## Why each binds to the spec rather than to a local type
 *
 * `../objectql.ts` states the rule it inherits: "Never Redefine Types. ALWAYS
 * import them." A hand-written near-copy is what `check:spec-symbols` exists to
 * stop, and the measured cost is not hypothetical — a local rule that looks
 * equivalent to a spec symbol can disagree with it in BOTH directions at once.
 * So:
 *
 *   - `drillDown` → the spec's `ChartDrillDownSchema` / `ChartDrillDown`, whose
 *     own doc names `<ObjectChart drillDown={…}>` as its carrier. ⛔ NOT this
 *     repo's wider `DrillDownConfig`: that one also carries `mode` and `report`
 *     for the table / pivot / metric widgets, and `ObjectChart.tsx` reads
 *     NEITHER — declaring them would advertise two keys accepted and then
 *     dropped.
 *   - `title` → `I18nLabel`, the union `ChartConfigSchema.title` carries and
 *     that `plugin-charts`' `normalizeChartSchema` already resolves through its
 *     `label()` helper (plain string OR inline locale map). The spec's
 *     `REACT_BLOCKS` entry for `ObjectChart` lists `title` among its
 *     `dataProps`, so this is a key the platform's authoring surface offers.
 *   - `compareTo` → `DashboardWidgetSchema.shape.compareTo` BY REFERENCE:
 *     `DashboardRenderer` composes the node with `compareTo: widget.compareTo`,
 *     forwarding the widget key verbatim, so producer and consumer are bound to
 *     one declaration instead of two dialects.
 *
 * ## The ceiling, stated rather than assumed (objectui#5155)
 *
 * `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()` and its TS twin carries `[key: string]: any`,
 * so declaring a key buys it its declared TYPE — `title: 42` is refused now —
 * but does NOT buy rejection of a MISSPELLING: `drillDwn: {}` still parses and
 * still compiles, exactly as `visibleWhn` does on `ObjectGallerySchema`
 * (objectui#6576). The counter-probe below pins that honestly so nobody reads
 * the declaration as more than it is.
 *
 * ## Four keys stay ledgered, and the ledger is not a waiver
 *
 * `xAxisKey`, `series`, `aggregate` and `filter` are read by the same file and
 * are objectui#7946's remit (PR #8884), not this card's. They are listed BY
 * NAME in {@link LEDGERED_OTHER_CARD_READS}, and every entry carries an
 * assertion that it is STILL READ — a stale exception is a hole. The ledger
 * deliberately does NOT assert that they stay undeclared, so this pin holds
 * whether or not that card has landed; what keeps it from rotting into a wider
 * equation is the independent pair of assertions below (every read key is
 * declared-or-ledgered, AND every key this card declared is still read).
