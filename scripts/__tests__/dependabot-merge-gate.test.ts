/**
 * objectui#4973 — `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` merged a pull request 8m20s before
 * its own test shard reported `failure`.
 *
 * `gh pr merge --auto --squash` was run unconditionally for every semver-patch
 * and semver-minor bump. `--auto` lands the merge the moment GitHub considers
 * the pull request mergeable — the moment the BRANCH-PROTECTION required set is
 * satisfied — which is a different set from "the checks this repository runs".
 * On 2026-08-17 #4959 (`lucide-react` 1.29.0 -> 1.31.0) was red on its own head
 * SHA `31745d8b` and merged anyway; `main` went red for every parallel agent and
 * #4968 had to repair it. It was the second time in seven days (#4098 was the
 * same test and the same dependency).
 *
 * ## Why the #4959 timeline is a FIXTURE here
 *
 * A workflow cannot be executed locally, so the usual way to argue about one is
 * a prose walkthrough in the pull-request body — which proves nothing later.
 * The decision therefore lives in `scripts/dependabot-merge-gate.mjs`, and the
 * measured check-run timeline of the incident lives below, so the central claim
 * of the fix is an assertion instead of a paragraph:
 *
 *   at 08:13:36Z, the second the old workflow merged #4959, this gate says
 *   `pending` -> nothing is merged;
 *   at 08:21:01Z, when shard 3/4 reports, it says `red` -> nothing is merged.
 *
 * Every field in `INCIDENT_4959` is copied from the check runs GitHub still has
 * for that SHA (19 runs; `started_at` / `completed_at` / `conclusion` verbatim).
 * `snapshotAt()` reconstructs what the API would have returned at any instant,
 * the same way the gate reads it.
 *
 * ## The other half: the buckets have to stay honest
 *
 * A declared required set is a second source of truth about which checks exist,
 * and the failure mode of a stale one is silence — a renamed job simply stops
 * being waited for, and the gate goes green a little earlier every time. So the
 * three buckets are asserted to PARTITION the set of check names that
 * `pull_request`-triggered workflows actually produce: nothing produced may be
 * unclassified, nothing classified may be unproduced. That is the assertion a
 * new `ci.yml` job or a renamed shard trips.
 *
 * The buckets' *reasons* are pinned too, not just their membership: every
 * required context must come from a workflow whose `pull_request` trigger has no
 * path filter (the #3523 rule — only an unfiltered gate reports on every pull
 * request and can therefore be waited for), and every optional context must come
 * from one that has such a filter (which is the entire reason it cannot be
 * required). Move a filter and the bucket, not just the comment, goes red.
