/**
 * `onNavigate` / `onAddComment` authored on a `detail-view` NODE — measured per
 * key through the real `SchemaRenderer`, and the guard that the named refusals
 * objectui#9447 adds to the mirror cannot be deleted quietly (the `views.zod.ts`
 * half of the pair objectui#7804 closed on `crud.zod.ts#DetailSchema`).
 *
 * ## The exposure
 *
 * `BaseSchemaCore` ends `.passthrough()`, so a key an arm does not declare is
 * not refused — it stops being judged and the value is KEPT. Until this card the
 * `detail-view` arm declared exactly one handler key (`onBack`, objectui#7344),
 * while its twin arm refused these two BY NAME, so the same two keys had two
 * different fates decided only by which `type` literal an author wrote.
 *
 * ## The read path, which is what made this a repair and not a widening
 *
 * `'detail'` registers `DetailView` RAW; `'detail-view'` registers
 * `DetailViewRenderer`, a data-source gate, and the card this pin belongs to was
 * filed without that path being measured. It is measured here. The gate hands
 * `DetailView` the object `useElementDataSourceSchema` returns, which is either
 * the node UNCHANGED (no composed binding) or a shallow `{ ...base }` spread
 * whose only overwrites are the binding keys. Neither branch strips a handler
 * key ⇒ the authored value arrives at `schema.onNavigate` / `schema.onAddComment`
 * BY IDENTITY, and suite 1 drives both to the call site rather than asserting it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `scripts/check-handler-key-read-sites.mjs` is GREEN on both keys and always
 * was: its transitive hop stops at the wrapper, so the read site it derives
 * under the `'detail'` registration has no counterpart here and neither key was
 * ever among its findings or its ledger. ⛔ That green is not evidence the keys
 * are unread — this file is the instrument for that question, the gate is not.
 *
 * ## Every control can fire
 *
 * `onNeverReadByAnyKnownReader` is authored on the SAME document in the SAME
 * render and must stay at zero calls — without it, a harness that invoked every
 * authored function would read exactly like a live channel. On the zod face
 * `onBack` is the LIT CONTROL: a named refusal on this arm since objectui#7344,
 * so it was refused before this change too, and a probe that could not see a
 * refusal at all would fail on it first instead of reporting a clean new pair.
 *
 * ## Predictions, written before the run
 *
 *   - suite 1 (reachability) PASSES on the base tree — the channels are what
 *     this change DECLARES, not what it builds;
 *   - suite 2 (the zod face) FAILS on both keys on the base tree:
 *     `DetailViewSchema.shape.onNavigate` and `.onAddComment` are `undefined`
 *     there and an authored action object parses GREEN, while `onBack` is green
 *     before and after;
 *   - suite 3 (the boundary) PASSES on the base tree — the nested key it pins
 *     is untouched by this card in either direction.
