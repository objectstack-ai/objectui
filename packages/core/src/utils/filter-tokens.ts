/**
 * Session-scoped filter placeholders — the sibling vocabulary to
 * `{date-macros}`.
 *
 * Filter values travel as JSON, so a user-scoped slice cannot call
 * `currentUser().id` inline; it writes a placeholder that this module expands
 * immediately before the filter reaches the data source:
 *
 *     { owner_id: '{current_user_id}' }
 *
 * ## Why this module exists (framework #3574)
 *
 * There used to be no shared resolver. Three ad-hoc implementations had grown
 * up independently — one in `ObjectView` for list views, one in
 * `ObjectDataPage` for URL filter triples, one in `NavigationRenderer` for
 * hrefs — and each handled only the shape its own surface happened to use.
 * Dashboard widgets never got one at all, so `{current_user_id}` in a widget
 * filter reached SQL as a literal, matched no row, and the widget rendered
 * `0` with no error in the console or the server log.
 *
 * The failure mode is the point: a metric reading `0` is indistinguishable
 * from a metric that is legitimately zero, so the bug survived review and
 * shipped. Any *new* surface that resolves placeholders itself will
 * eventually reproduce it, which is why resolution lives here, once, and
 * every surface calls {@link resolveFilterPlaceholders}.
 *
 * ## Presentation scope, NOT a security boundary
 *
 * These tokens scope what a surface *shows*. They do not decide what a caller
 * is *allowed* to read — that is RLS, enforced server-side against a
 * different vocabulary rooted at `current_user` (`owner_id = current_user.id`).
 * Dropping a `{current_user_id}` filter widens a view; it must never widen
 * access. Never use a context token as an access control.
 *
 * ## Contract source
 *
 * The canonical vocabulary is published as part of the platform contract at
 * `@objectstack/spec/data` → `CONTEXT_TOKENS`. This module used to carry a
 * hand-written copy of that tuple under the spec's own name, with a comment
 * saying the duplication was "temporary until the next coordinated release"
 * — the installed spec (17.0.0-rc.0) has exported it for some time, so the
 * copy was simply a fork wearing the spec's name (objectstack#4115).
 *
 * It is now a **re-export**, which is the only form that cannot drift: the
 * copy was byte-identical, so every value comparison and every behavioural
 * test passed while it sat here. Reference identity is the one check that
 * distinguishes a re-export from a fork (objectui#3003).
 *
 * The same argument retired the two module-local copies that sat beside it
 * until objectui#7265 — the near-miss suggestion map and the membership
 * predicate are imported from `@objectstack/spec/data` now, so neither can
 * drift either. Both were re-measured against the RESOLVED pin (17.4.0; the
 * card had measured 17.2.0) before the swap, because "byte-identical" is a
 * statement about a version, not a property: the map matched on nine keys, in
 * the same order, with the same values, and the two predicates agreed on every
 * one of 61 real vocabulary members — the token tuple, both suggestion key
 * sets, the date-macro tokens and their aliases, plus casing, whitespace and
 * prototype-key spellings. Each comparison ran a lit control of the same kind
 * through the same comparator (the spec's own token-description map, and its
 * date-macro predicate), so "no difference" came from an instrument shown able
 * to report one.

 * dashboard widget carries (`{ owner_id: '{current_user_id}' }`) and the
 * condition/triple arrays a list view carries (`[{ field, operator, value }]`
 * / `[['owner','=','…']]`). The predecessor helper in `ObjectView` bailed on
 * non-arrays (`if (!Array.isArray(filter)) return filter`), which is why
 * lifting it into the dashboard would have been a silent no-op.
 *
 * Only whole-string placeholders are substituted — an id is an opaque value,
 * so embedding it in a larger string (`'user-{current_user_id}'`) is never
 * what an author means, and substituting there would silently produce a value
 * that matches nothing. Unknown tokens are passed through untouched so that
 * date macros and nav-only `AppContextSelector` ids survive this pass.
 *
 * An unresolvable *known* token is deliberately left as-is rather than
 * dropped: leaving it yields an empty result, whereas dropping the clause
 * would widen the result set — and a filter that silently widens is far worse
 * than one that silently narrows.
