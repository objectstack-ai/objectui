/**
 * objectui#7121 — what the Interfaces pillar may OFFER beside a studio-canvas
 * leaf.
 *
 * ## The mechanism
 *
 * `registerStudioCanvasPreview(type, …)` opts a type into a surface-specific
 * canvas: the running app, not an editable draft. That is a contract, not a
 * habit — `StudioCanvasPreviewProps` is deliberately a small read-only subset
 * of `MetadataPreviewProps` with **no `selection`, no `onSelectionChange`, no
 * `onPatch`, no `editing`**. So a studio-canvas leaf:
 *
 *   - can never produce a block selection (there is no block tree), and
 *   - can never read the design/run mode (nothing is handed `editing`).
 *
 * Two affordances beside it ignored both facts: the Design/Run switch (#5800)
 * was still offered though `canvasMode` reached no renderer, and the rail fell
 * through to *"Click a block on the canvas, and edit its properties right
 * here."* — an instruction that cannot be followed.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ This is NOT #6795 part C's cause, and the precondition says so
 *
 * Part C repaired what the pillar says when the designer registries are
 * **empty**. Every test here asserts a **POPULATED** registry first
 * (`listMetadataPreviewTypes()` non-empty), because a zero-registry reading
 * would measure that other card instead. The cause here is an ungated
 * affordance, not a missing registration.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The message promises no recovery
 *
 * Part C established by measurement that these registries are plain `Map`s read
 * during render with no subscription, so a consumer that read an empty one
 * never recovers ("late inspector rendered: false") — no "loading…", no "try
 * again". Here the constraint is even stricter: the statement is not about
 * registration at all. This canvas has no blocks **by contract**, so there is
 * nothing to wait for, and the last test pins the absence of recovery language.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The discriminator is `StudioCanvas`, NOT `isEditable`
 *
 * `isEditable = !!Preview && !StudioCanvas` is a conjunction of two independent
 * causes. Gating on it would also strip these affordances from leaves whose
 * only fault is that **their own type** has no designer — the exact state
 * `StudioDesignSurface.designerRegistryPartial.test.tsx` pins as still deserving
 * the ordinary "click a block" rail. That file is the live fence: gate on
 * `isEditable` and it goes red.
 *
 * ## objectui#11823 — the `object` leaf's panel now edits its list view
 *
 * The statement below is still true of a studio-canvas leaf in general, and
 * still what its rail says, but no longer of `object`: the list an `object`
 * leaf's canvas shows IS package metadata, and its Properties panel edits that
 * list view (`StudioDesignSurface.listViewInspector-11823.test.tsx`). So the
 * statement's pins are taken on a second studio-canvas type, `report` (a stub
 * canvas registered below), and the `object` leaf keeps the pins that are
 * still true of it: no Design/Run switch, no "click a block" invitation, no
 * foreign block opened.
