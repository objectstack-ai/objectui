 *
 * **Re-exported from `@object-ui/core`, not reimplemented here.** There is
 * exactly ONE implementation — `packages/core/src/evaluator/predicateInput.ts`
 * — shared by the engine path (`ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation`) and the
 * renderer path (`action-button` / `action-menu` / `action-bar` / …). See that
 * file for the accepted input shapes and for why a `cel` envelope must survive
 * normalization (#2661 / #3314).
 *
 * ## Why a re-export and not a twin (#3367)
 *
 * This module used to carry an independent renderer-side implementation with
 * item-for-item identical semantics, held in step with the canonical one by a
 * 14-shape normalization parity table. That table was a *guardrail against
 * drift*, not a single source of truth — and #3314 is the record of what two
 * normalizations do when left alone: they drift, and the same `visible:`
 * predicate reaches different verdicts depending on which path surfaced the
 * action. A re-export cannot drift, so the parity suite now pins identity
 * (`react`'s export IS `core`'s function) instead of enumerating shapes, and
 * keeps pinning the two PATHS verdict-for-verdict.
 *
 * Routing hook code through the `@object-ui/core` barrel is not a new coupling:
 * this module already imports `ExpressionEvaluator` / `evalRowPredicate` from
 * it, and `@object-ui/core` is a declared dependency of `@object-ui/react`
 * (the reverse direction is the forbidden one — core declares "Zero React
 * dependencies").

/**
 * Build the predicate context for a **row record** — the bag to hand
 * {@link useCondition} when the thing being gated is scoped to one record.
 *
 * The row is bound ONE way: `record.status` — the canon (objectui#5330, ruled
 * 2026-08-20; Phase 2 executed by objectui#5741). This is not a dialect choice;
 * it is one rule, and it is `evalRowPredicate`'s rule
 * (`core/evaluator/listConditional.ts` — the record header, list rows, the row
 * kebab and conditional formatting all evaluate through it), restated here for
 * the `useCondition` tier so both tiers answer an author's `visible:` the same
 * way.
 *
 * ## The two retired spellings (objectui#5741)
 *
 * Until Phase 2 this bag also carried the row spread flat (bare `status`, the
 * row-action shorthand) and as `data` (legacy), and `useCondition` below warned
 * once per non-canonical spelling (Phase 1, PR #5737). Both bindings and the
 * warning are gone. A bare-field or `data.*` predicate against this bag now
 * faults exactly as it always did on the server (`buildScope({ record })`
 * mounts exactly `['record']`: `Unknown variable: status` / `Unknown variable:
 * data`), and each `useCondition` leg applies its EXISTING fault policy — the
 * throwing legs (`throwOnError`: `action:button` / `action:menu` `visible`,
 * `DeclaredActionsBar`'s `visible`) hide and report `was hidden/disabled: its
 * predicate threw`, naming the variable; the non-throwing legs fail soft to
 * `true`. The same holds for a legacy `${data.x}` / `${x}` string: one bag
 * shape, both dialects. Nothing detects a retired spelling here; it is simply
 * unbound. `@object-ui/core`'s `evaluator/rowPredicateCanon.ts` carries the
 * canon statement, the server measurement, the layer scoping (`data` stays
 * canonical one layer over, in a metadata-editing form — ADR-0089 D3) and the
 * offline detector.
 *
 * ## Why a helper and not "just `{ record }`" (objectui#4075 / #4080)
 *
 * Because the rule has two halves and every predicate face has to get both:
 * the SHAPE — `record` is the row's one name, so `record.viewer.can_act`, what
 * every declared action on framework's `sys_approval_request` gates on
 * (framework#3310 / #3424), reaches the row — and the NO-ROW case below.
 * `DeclaredActionsBar` and the four generic action renderers once carried
 * inline copies of this bag and drifted (objectui#4077 / #4079); one named
 * helper is what keeps a fifth copy from drifting again.
 *
 * Note the direction of the merge: `useCondition` evaluates on
 * `new ExpressionEvaluator({ ...scope, ...context })`, so this bag's `record`
 * shadows an ambient `record` a host put in the predicate scope — the row is
 * the subject — while every OTHER ambient key (`features`, `user`, a host's own
 * `data`) survives to the predicate as the host's own.
 *
 * This is the BINDING rule only. It deliberately does not touch the evaluation
 * entry — `useCondition` / `toPredicateInput` / `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate`
 * keep their pinned semantics (objectui#3492 / #3842 / #3850 / #3871), and each
 * caller keeps its own error policy (fail-closed `visible` vs the fail-soft
 * legs). Binding the row is a different question from what to do when the
 * predicate faults.
 *
 * ## No row → bind NOTHING, do not bind an empty one
 *
 * `null` / `undefined` / a non-object returns an EMPTY bag, not
 * `{ record: {} }`. The difference is load-bearing: `useCondition` merges this
 * context OVER the ambient predicate scope, so binding an empty record would
 * blank out a `record` that a host had put in the scope itself — which is
 * exactly how `action:group`'s dropdown leaf is driven in
 * `action-group-dropdown-visible.test.tsx`, and it is a legitimate way for a
 * host to supply the row. "This surface has no row of its own" must stay
 * distinct from "this surface's row is empty"; only the latter is entitled to
 * shadow the scope.
 *
 * @param record The row, or nothing.
