 * #0.1 exists to stop, and it would bless as supported a params shape
 * `AggregateParams` does not even declare. Retiring the branch was option D and

 * (`ObjectChart`'s gate requires a non-array `aggregate.groupBy`, and all three
 * in-tree constructors pass a string), but `ObjectChart`'s props are `any` and
 * an out-of-repo host may already send this shape. So the branch stays, and it
 * says no out loud.
 *
 * What that buys is the FAILURE MODE, not a failure count. The receiving engine
 * already refuses these arrays ("is not a filter" — objectstack's
 * `engine-filter-array-lowering.test.ts`), so nothing that reaches this point
 * could have produced a correct number; the pre-existing behaviour was to find
 * that out on the wire, or worse, to have the predicate quietly dropped while

 * Lower an analytics `filter` into the `where` the analytics wire declares.

 * protocol shape. It is lowered to a `FilterCondition` at the single sink
 * `parseFilterAST` (`@objectstack/spec/data`) the moment it arrives, and only
 * the lowered `FilterCondition` travels any further. `where` on a query is a
 * `FilterCondition` and stays one." A POST body is transport, not one of the
 * declared doors where an array may arrive (React block props, `FilterBuilder`,
 * the REST `$filter` query string) — so the lowering happens HERE, before the
 * body is built, and only a `FilterCondition` goes out.
 *
 * Three shapes, three answers:
 *
 * - A NON-array filter is already a `FilterCondition` — the MongoDB-style
 *   object this branch was written for, and what `AnalyticsQuerySchema.where`
 *   declares. Passed through untouched; translating it here would be a semantic
 *   change, not a fix.
 * - An EMPTY array is no filter, so no `where` key is posted at all. Decided
 *   here rather than inferred: `parseFilterAST([])` is `undefined`, and the
 *   in-process analytics door reads `[]` the same way ("`[]` is no filter",
 *   objectstack#5334). The two readings agree, and this pins that they do.
 * - Every other array is first normalised by `translateFilterArray` — the SAME
 *   function `find()` runs in `convertQueryParams`, so one stored filter cannot
 *   mean two things on two paths — and then lowered by the sink.

 * Anything the sink cannot lower is refused, never posted and never dropped:

 *   route absent    404 `ROUTE_NOT_FOUND`  (runtime dispatcher, framework#4019)
 *   cube unknown    404 `CUBE_NOT_FOUND`   (service-analytics' inference gate)

 * direction: the mapping read a field it did not quote. Branch on the `code`;
 * consult the status only as a residual, when the answer declared no code at
 * all. Comparisons go through `errorCodeIs`/`errorCodeIsAnyOf` — the pre- and
 * post-ADR-0112 spellings both have to match (`@object-ui/types`).
 *
 * ### Both envelope families reach this function already decorated (MEASURED)
 *
 * `/analytics/query` exits through `@objectstack/runtime`'s
 * `dispatcher-plugin.errorResponseBase`, i.e. the **wrapped** `{ success:
 * false, error: { code, message } }` shape — not the flat one the dataset
 * route writes — and its 401 is `enforceAuth`'s **flat** `ANONYMOUS_DENY_BODY`.
 * The client's fetch wrapper flattens BOTH before throwing:
 * `errorBody?.code ?? errorBody?.error?.code` → `error.code`, plus
 * `error.httpStatus = res.status`. So no envelope reading belongs here; unlike
 * `queryDataset` (which owns its `fetch` and must read the body itself), this
 * function is handed the already-flattened error and reads one field.

 *   - **`not-installed`** — *degrade LOUDLY*. The deployment has no analytics
 *     service: 501 `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` (route mounted, nothing behind it) or 404
 *     `ROUTE_NOT_FOUND` (framework#4019 stops mounting the routes at all).
 *     A client-side aggregate over a scoped `find()` answers the chart
 *     correctly, and the operator is told once that the semantic layer is off.
 *   - **`rejected`** — *THROW*. The server refused OUR body: 400
 *     `VALIDATION_FAILED` (framework#4010 validates `/analytics/query` at the
 *     entry) OR any other coded 400 (objectui#7755 — e.g. `service-analytics`
 *     ships its own 400 `INVALID_FILTER` on a filter shape it refuses). The
 *     status alone is decisive once it is 400: a producer that refuses the
 *     body and ships a code this consumer does not enumerate is refusing it
 *     exactly as hard as one that ships `VALIDATION_FAILED` — the refusal is
 *     in the transport fact, not in which code spells it. Degrading would
 *     answer our own contract violation with plausible numbers from a
 *     different code path (`find()`'s `$filter` accepts array shapes the
 *     analytics body does not) and bury it — the misdirection framework#3878
 *     documented.
 *   - **`unauthenticated`** — *THROW*. 401 `UNAUTHENTICATED`: the request was
 *     refused before it ran, so it is evidence about the SESSION and none at
 *     all about the capability. Degrading is not merely misleading here, it is
 *     futile: the fallback's `find()` carries the same lapsed token and is
 *     refused the same way, so the chart cannot be answered either. "Sign in
 *     again" is an action; "install @objectstack/service-analytics" is not.
 *   - **`cube-not-found`** — *THROW*. 404 `CUBE_NOT_FOUND`
 *     (`analytics-service.assertInferableCube`, framework#3867): analytics IS
 *     installed and answering — the NAME does not exist. That gate throws only
 *     when the name is neither a registered cube nor a registered object, and
 *     the fallback asks `/data/<the same name>`, which objectql's
 *     `assertObjectRegistered` (framework#3770) answers 404 `OBJECT_NOT_FOUND`.
 *     So degrading cannot produce numbers; it can only swap a message that
 *     names the fix ("Define a Cube in your stack, or check the object name")
 *     for a distant one, behind a warning that instructs the wrong repair.
 *   - **`unknown`** — *degrade SILENTLY*. Anything else (5xx, network, a code
 *     this consumer does not know): a transient failure, not a deployment
 *     missing a capability and not a request that named something absent.

 * - **`fields`** — narrowed to its string elements. Deliberately NOT given a

 *   of version skew, whereas `fields` is `z.array(z.string())` in the spec and

 *   an element degrades to a wrong label — `42`, `[object Object]`, `true`, or
 *   an empty entry for `null` — never a throw, which is why this is repaired as
 *   an honesty defect rather than a crash.
 * - **`object`** — taken from the wire when it is a string, otherwise from
 *   `fallbackObject`, which is the object the adapter just wrote to. That is
 *   not a lenient alias: the caller KNOWS the resource, and the batch path has
 *   always healed the same hole this way for the event's `resource`. Narrowing
 *   the gate on `object` instead would drop the entry — and no reader depends
 *   on it (`writeWarningToast` names fields off `WriteWarningEvent.resource`),

 * What the batch path writes for `object` / `resource` when the response did

 *
 * {@link ObjectStackAdapter.notifyBatchDroppedFields} resolves the object a
 * cross-object strip is about from the wire entry's own `object`, else from the
 * operation its `index` addresses. When the wire named no object AND the index
 * addresses no operation in the request WE sent, nothing is left to name it
 * with: the adapter knows every operation in its own batch, so an index outside
 * that list cannot be healed the way a missing `object` is healed on the
 * single-record path (there the fallback is the resource the caller passed in,
 * which is always a real name).
 *
 * REACHABILITY — only from a response that is off-spec twice over. The spec's
 * `CrossObjectBatchDroppedFieldsSchema` declares BOTH `object: z.string()` and
 * `index: z.number()` REQUIRED, and the batch response documents `results` as
 * index-aligned with the request's `operations`. A conformant server therefore
 * cannot produce this entry; it takes one that omits (or non-strings) `object`
 * AND sends an index naming no operation, in the same entry. Nothing in this
 * repo emits that shape, and whether a deployed backend does is not answerable
 * from here. Unlike objectui#6889's exotic case this is not structurally
 * impossible — the payload arrives as parsed JSON, and a non-conformant server
 * can send it.
 *
 * WHY THE ENTRY IS STILL EMITTED rather than refused. Measured end to end
 * through the real chain (`onWriteWarning` into `app-shell`'s
 * `emitWriteWarning`, with the real `t` and the real `fieldLabel`): the user
 * still gets the whole warning — the save acknowledgement, the field list and
 * the reason sentence — with fields named by their api key instead of their
 * label. Refusing the entry would replace a truthful, useful warning with
 * silence for a strip the server really did report, which is objectui#3484's
 * failure and the reason neither `object` nor `reason` is gated on above.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT WIDENED AWAY EITHER. Letting the notice say "no object" means
 * making `object` optional on {@link DroppedFieldsNotice}, whose canonical arm
 * IS the spec's `DroppedFieldsEvent` (objectui#3160). That writes "servers may
 * omit `object`" into our published client type to accommodate a producer
 * violating two REQUIRED spec fields — the lenient consumer-side fallback
 * AGENTS.md #0.1 bans, fossilising the producer's bug into a second de-facto
 * contract. The contract-first repair for an off-spec response is at the
 * producer.
 *
 * So this is neither the skew arm's "tolerate" (objectui#4934 — a `reason` from
 * the future is the producer running AHEAD of us, expected version skew) nor
 * `fields`' "refuse" (objectui#6889 — an off-spec element that would otherwise
 * reach a consumer typed as a field name). There is no producer value to keep
 * or drop here: the question is only what WE write when the response supplied
 * nothing. The answer is a DECLARED placeholder rather than a bare literal that
 * reads as a name.
 *
 * IT MUST STAY FALSY, and that is why it is not exported. The sole consumer
 * (`app-shell`'s `writeWarningToast`, reached through `AdapterProvider`) gates
 * label resolution on `adapter && ev.resource`, so an empty resource skips the
 * schema lookup and names fields by their api key — the truthful fallback. A
 * namespaced sentinel like {@link UNRECOGNIZED_DROP_REASON} would be TRUTHFUL
 * but TRUTHY, and would send that consumer to `getObjectSchema('objectui:...')`
 * and `fieldLabel('objectui:...', ...)`. No consumer should branch on this
 * value's identity; the falsiness check is the whole correct handling, and
 * `droppedFieldsUnattributed.boundary.test.ts` pins both halves.

 * no discriminant at all.
 *
 * Measured against the actual write paths, not guessed:
 *
 * - A genuine saved view is always created with a NESTED `config` — the
 *   ViewItem-record shape `{name, object, viewKind, config}` (app-shell's
 *   `viewEnvelope`, and this adapter's own {@link ObjectStackAdapter.createView}
 *   `fullSpec`). `viewKind` lives OUTSIDE `config` on that shape.
 * - A personalization overlay (`updateViewConfig`) is always FLAT — its
 *   fields sit at the top level, never wrapped in `config`.
 *
 * `viewKind` on a FLAT row is therefore never something objectui itself
 * authors: the only way it gets there is the platform's own server-side
 * identity inheritance (`viewIdentityPatch`, `@objectstack/metadata-protocol`
 * #2555 / #7741), which fires ONLY when the write's `name` resolves against a
 * REGISTRY-backed (i.e. system, code-defined) view. A runtime-created saved
 * view has no registry entry to inherit from, so its row — even flattened by
 * a later toolbar toggle — never gains a `viewKind`. So "flat body + a
 * `viewKind`" is a reliable signature of "override on a system view", while a
 * flat row with NO `viewKind` is left alone — exactly the shape the existing
 * legacy-bare-spec pin relies on staying a saved view (`listViews.test.ts` —
 * "keeps legacy bare specs without a viewKind (saved/list views)").
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT try to catch every legacy override: a row the
 * CURRENT `persistViewPatch` writes (pre-marker) also copies the system
 * view's full body — `type`/`columns`/`data` — into the override, and *that*
 * shape is structurally indistinguishable from an untouched saved view's own
 * body without this `viewKind` signal or the new marker above. Those rows

 *
 * - **read** (PR #5272, {@link narrowPersonalizationOverlay}): the consumer
 *   that MERGES an overlay over a source view contributes only these keys, so

 * - **write** (objectui#5233, `buildPersistedViewBody` in app-shell's

 *   surface as a runtime-only overlay key — objectstack#9933, released in

 *   view's* own row is deliberately still written whole — for it the body IS

  /**
   * Install the ONE emitter for the metadata save door (#4237).
   *
   * ## Why this seam, and what it covers
   *
   * `ObjectStackClient.meta.saveItem` is the second client class that writes
   * through `PUT /api/v1/meta/:type/:name`, and every one of its callers reaches
   * it through an adapter this class constructed — the four inside this file
   * (`updateViewConfig`, the two view paths, `updateDashboard`) via
   * `this.client`, and every caller outside it via {@link getClient}, which
   * hands back this same instance: `MetadataService` (app-shell, five saves),
   * `useNavigationSync`, and plugin-designer's Create/EditAppPage. Wrapping the
   * method once here therefore covers all of them WITHOUT a per-site edit, which
   * is the whole point — a toast copied into a dozen call sites is the shape
   * #4133 rejected for the other client class and it is no better here.
   *
   * `meta` is an own, writable property assigned per instance in the SDK's
   * constructor (`this.meta = { … }`), and the client this adapter builds is
   * never shared, so the wrap is bounded to an object this adapter owns for its
   * whole lifetime. It is not a prototype or global patch.
   *
   * ## Response shape — measured, not assumed
   *
   * The two client classes' envelopes coincide at the top level, which is what
   * makes `readSaveAdvisories` reusable unchanged across both. `SaveMetaItem-
   * ResponseSchema` puts `advisories` at the body's top level next to
   * `success` / `version` / `seq` / `state`, and the SDK's `unwrapResponse`
   * strips its `{ success, data }` envelope only when the body actually HAS a
   * `data` key — this body does not, so it is returned verbatim. So the same
   * reader that `MetadataClient.save` uses reads this response correctly, and
   * the pins in `onSaveAdvisory.test.ts` drive a real SDK client through a fake
   * `fetch` rather than stubbing `meta`, so that continues to be measured.
   *
   * ## Draft-door honesty (D1)
   *
   * Drafts are NEVER gated: the framework returns at its D1 early-return
   * (`if (args.state !== 'active') return null`) before running a rule, so a
   * draft save produces no findings to withhold. This client class has no draft
   * door at all to worry about — the SDK's `saveItem(type, name, item)` takes no
   * mode and always writes the active door, which is exactly why the gate DOES
   * run for its callers. `mode` on the emitted event is therefore derived from
   * the response's own `state` rather than from a request-side flag that does
   * not exist here: `'draft'` when the server says the row landed as a draft,
   * `'publish'` otherwise. That keeps the event truthful about which door it
   * came through instead of hard-coding one.

   * back empty for every object, forever, and every saved personalization
   * read back as "setting didn't save".
   *

   * authoritative "this object has no overrides" (callers may trust it and
   * skip the per-view reads); a transport/permission failure is "I could
   * not tell", and reporting the two as the same value is what made
   * ObjectView's per-view {@link getView} fallback unreachable code. When
   * we cannot tell, we do not pretend we can. Rejections are not cached
   * (the cache stores on success only), so a transient failure does not
   * pin an empty answer for the TTL.
   *
   * Result is cached identically to {@link getView}, and EVERY view write —
   * on this adapter and above it — invalidates it through the one seam,

   *   tab lives ONLY here until an explicit Publish;
   * - the **published** overlay (`client.meta.getItem` / `saveItem`).
   *
   * The draft is probed FIRST, and a hit is merged and written straight back
   * as a draft. Two things that ordering buys, both load-bearing:
   *
   * 1. A draft-only view is no longer invisible to the read. It used to 404,
   *    and a `catch {}` labelled "treat missing as create-equivalent"
   *    substituted `current = {}` — so a rename merged onto nothing and went
   *    out as a `{label, name, object}` partial the server rejects (422),
   *    while the draft row the UI reads back through `?preview=draft` kept the
   *    old label. The edit was lost with no error surfaced to the user.
   * 2. A draft is never bypassed. Writing the published row while a draft is
   *    pending would put the edit somewhere the draft shadows — and Publish
   *    would then overwrite it with the pre-edit body, losing the change a
   *    second time, later, where nothing connects it to this call.
   *
   * A draft edit stays a draft: `mode: 'draft'` keeps ADR-0037's guarantee
   * that nothing the preview shows goes live until Publish. Renaming a
   * *published* view (no draft pending) is unchanged — it writes the
   * published overlay, as before.
   *
   * **Both halves invalidate through {@link invalidateViewKeys}** (objectui#4363,
   * #4373) — same call, same key set, so the draft half's deliberate
   * over-invalidation is the seam's uniform rule rather than a per-branch
   * decision this method has to keep re-making.
   *
   * @throws when the view resolves in neither home, or when either read fails
   *   for any other reason (network, permission). Both used to be swallowed
   *   and converted into the bad partial write above; a caller that wants a
   *   view created should call {@link createView}, which is the operation that

   * update, one home is the right home; for a delete, "remove this view" is
   * satisfied only when NO home is left serving it.
   *
   * So both homes are deleted, **draft first**. The order is load-bearing on
   * the failure path: a fault between the two calls leaves the PUBLISHED
   * overlay intact, so the view is still served and the operation is cleanly
   * retryable. The reverse order would strand a draft-only view — which is
   * precisely the bug shape above.
   *
   * **Two blind calls, no probe.** The framework's `deleteMetaItem` answers a
   * missing home with a **200** carrying `reset:false` (`"No pending draft
   * for view/x."` / `"No view 'x' found — nothing to delete."`), never a 404,
   * so there is nothing for a probe to protect against. `updateView` needs its
   * probe for a different reason — its read must resolve the row the merge
   * writes back to — and that reason has no counterpart for a delete.
   *
   * **One transport, one error contract.** Both halves go through
   * {@link MetadataClient} (`reset`), the transport that can express the
   * `?state=` qualifier and the one `updateView`'s draft half already uses.
   * The published half used to go through `client.meta.deleteItem`; measured,
   * that issues the byte-identical request (`DELETE
   * {baseUrl}/api/v1/meta/view/:name`, no environment scoping is configured on
   * this adapter), so routing it here costs no addressing change and buys a
   * single `MetadataError` shape across both calls instead of two.
   *
   * @returns `deleted` is true only when no home is left serving the view AND
   *   at least one actually held a row. A view that existed in neither home
   *   still answers `false`, unchanged. The per-home outcomes are additive:
   *   a partial result is observable rather than rounded up to `true`.
   * @throws when either delete fails, matching {@link updateView}'s
   *   convention of surfacing the fault rather than degrading. A failure of
   *   the PUBLISHED half after the draft was discarded carries the partial
   *   state on the error's `outcome` — "draft gone, overlay left" is exactly
   *   what the old `{ deleted: boolean }` could not express.
   *
   * Invalidates through {@link invalidateViewKeys}: the deleted row leaves the
   * batch override map too, and a ghost entry there is what the object page
   * would keep applying (objectui#4363). Fired in a `finally`, so it happens
   * once per call on EVERY outcome including the throw — after a half-failure
   * the draft row really is gone, and #4363's asymmetry decides it: an
   * unnecessary invalidation costs one refetch, a missed one costs the cache's
   * full 5-minute TTL of stale overrides.

   * Ask the by-name meta app route WHY an app is not in this session's app list
   * (objectui#4252).
   *
   * The app LIST is the generic metadata list route `GET /api/v1/meta/:type`,
   * requested with the singular type segment `app` — the same address this
   * method appends a name to below, and the one `MetadataProvider` reads its
   * items from. The server filters that list per session in `filterAppForUser`
   * (`packages/rest/src/rest-server.ts`, applied inside the `:type` list handler
   * once the type segment resolves to `app`), so an app withheld by
   * `requiredPermissions` and an app
   * that does not exist are byte-identical there: both are simply absent. A
   * console reading only that list has one fact and two conditions, and it
   * renders its copy for the wrong one — "it may still be publishing" over a
   * permanent authorization decision, which cost a downstream acceptance round
   * two test batches spent chasing a platform defect that was a missing
   * permission-set binding.
   *
   * The maintainer ruling (2026-08-12) put the answer on the BY-NAME route
   * rather than in the list, so the enumeration surface is not widened past what
   * a by-name probe already implies (objectstack#8013 / PR #8135): an app that
   * exists and whose `requiredPermissions` the session lacks answers `403` with
   * `PERMISSION_DENIED` in the declared envelope, and absence — a nonexistent
   * name, an unpublished app, an app gated by an absent optional service —
   * keeps answering `404 RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`.

   * ## Why this is a separate method and not a flavour of {@link getApp}
   *
   *  - `getApp` degrades EVERY failure to `null`, which is exactly the
   *    conflation this exists to undo; changing it would silently re-point its
   *    own callers' fallback-to-static-config path.
   *  - `getApp` memoises in `metadataCache`. A verdict about the CALLER must not
   *    be cached beside a document about the APP — one grant, and a cached
   *    denial outlives the session it described.
   *
   * Nothing here throws: a probe that cannot reach an answer returns `unknown`
   * and the caller keeps whatever it was already showing. Only the measured
