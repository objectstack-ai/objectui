/**
 * objectui#8924: prose in this tree states which `@objectstack/*` version is
 * INSTALLED, and nothing reads those sentences.
 *
 * ## Why a gate and not a sweep of corrected sentences
 *
 * objectui#8897 corrected SIX statements that said the pin **is 17.3.0**. It
 * found them with a probe that was version-literal on `17.3.0`, so it was blind
 * BY CONSTRUCTION to the identical sentence written about an earlier pin: the
 * `17.2.0` cohort was never in its field of view. Re-running by PREDICATE
 * rather than by version string, on `16fc4cf20`, finds 68 present-tense claim
 * sites in 55 files — 9 of them naming the pin correctly and 59 off it, spread
 * over 16 workspace packages and `scripts/`. The LEDGER below is that
 * population, entry by entry.
 *
 * That is the whole lesson, and it is a lesson about instruments, not about
 * sentences: a probe shaped like the example you already have cannot measure
 * the class it belongs to. A corrected version number with nothing checking it
 * regenerates the same card at the next bump — objectui#8606, #8629 and #8752
 * reached that conclusion from three other directions before this one did.
 *
 * So this file is the reader those sentences never had. It resolves the pin
 * from the ARTIFACT, recognises claims about the pin in prose, and fails when
 * the two disagree.
 *
 * ## The distinction this gate exists to preserve
 *
 * Two classes of sentence name a version, and only one of them can rot:
 *
 *   - **"when it changed"** — "17.3.0 made `reference` a hard requirement",
 *     "43 keys at 17.3.0", "New in `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0". These are
 *     permanently true. A gate that "fixes" them rewrites history into a
 *     falsehood, and that is strictly worse than the stale claim it replaces.
 *   - **"what is installed"** — "Measured against the installed
 *     `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0", "the pin is still 17.2.0". These are the
 *     subject, and they are false the moment the lockfile moves.
 *
 * A bare version literal cannot tell them apart, which is why the predicate
 * below requires an installed-ness MARKER as well as a version, and why
 * `HISTORICAL_CUES` refuses lines that carry the marker inside a sentence about
 * the past. `scripts/__tests__/check-installed-spec-pin-claims.test.ts` pins
 * both directions on REAL lines of this tree, each with a firing control — a
 * refusal demonstrated only on lines where nothing could have fired is not a
 * demonstration of the distinction.
 *
 * ## What it promises, and what it does not
 *
 * PROMISED. Every recognised, present-tense claim about an installed
 * `@objectstack/*` version either names the version the artifact resolves to,
 * or carries a `LEDGER` entry with a class and a reason. The ledger ratchets in
 * BOTH directions: an entry naming a claim that is no longer in the tree fails
 * too, so cleaning a docblock forces the list to shrink and the list can never
 * rot into a permanent hole. (Same stance as `KNOWN_CLAIMS` in
 * `scripts/__tests__/doc-version-claims.test.ts` and `DOCUMENTATION_EXEMPT` in
 * `ci-cd-pipeline-doc.test.ts`.)
 *
 * NOT PROMISED, stated so it is not mistaken for covered:
 *
 *   - **The measured FACT beside the version.** "installed 17.2.0:
 *     `SelectOptionSchema` is `.strict()`" carries two claims; this gate judges
 *     the version and says nothing about the schema. That is why a ledger entry
 *     is not a licence to find-and-replace the number — each site has to be
 *     re-parsed against the resolved artifact before its stamp moves, or the
 *     repair plants a FRESH false premise. objectui#8897 did that re-parse for
 *     each of its six sites; it is the expensive half and it is deliberately
 *     not in this gate's remit.
 *   - **Claims split across lines.** Recognition is per line, because the
 *     marker and the version have to be read together and a docblock paragraph
 *     has no machine-visible boundary. A claim whose marker sits one line above
 *     its version is invisible here, and this tree has one:
 *     `packages/i18n/src/utils/spec-formatters.ts` ends a line with "The pinned"
 *     and opens the next with "17.0.0-rc.6 removed all four". That claim is as
 *     stale as any in the LEDGER and this gate cannot see it — recorded here
 *     rather than left for the next reader to discover as a silent hole.
 *   - **CHANGELOG and `.changeset/*.md`.** A pending changeset becomes a
 *     CHANGELOG entry verbatim, so both are DATED RECORDS of a change, not
 *     claims about today. Excluded by path, never by classification.
 *
 * ## Where it runs
 *
 * `scripts/__tests__/check-installed-spec-pin-claims.test.ts` runs it over the
 * real tree, so the ordinary vitest suite is the blocking copy — the same
 * placement `doc-version-claims.test.ts` has, and for the same reason: this
 * reads TEXT and a lockfile, needs no build and no network, so a dedicated
 * workflow would buy a second thing to keep wired and nothing else.
 * `pnpm check:installed-pin-claims` is the human entry point.
 *
 * Run:     node scripts/check-installed-spec-pin-claims.mjs
 *          node scripts/check-installed-spec-pin-claims.mjs --explain
 *          node scripts/check-installed-spec-pin-claims.mjs --json
 * Exit:    0 = OK, 1 = a claim drifted, or the ledger is stale
