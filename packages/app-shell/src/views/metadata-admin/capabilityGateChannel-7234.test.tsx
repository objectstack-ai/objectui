/**
 * objectui#7234 — the author-facing channel for the `requiredPermissions` hide.
 *
 * ## What this pins, and why it is a channel rather than a fix
 *
 * The card was opened as "object-bound actions never render". That premise was
 * falsified and the falsification is pinned by
 * `ObjectView.objectBoundActions-7234.test.tsx`: the relay carries
 * `objectDef.actions`, the button IS drawn, and ADR-0066 D4's
 * `requiredPermissions` capability gate is what hides it — at every declared
 * location at once, with no error and no 4xx.
 *
 * The maintainer ruled option B on 2026-09-08: the hide STAYS for end users,
 * and the reason becomes visible where the person who configures the app looks.
 * So there is nothing to fix in the gate, and these cases are not about the
 * gate's verdict at all. They pin that the action designer — the panel pair the
 * console docs name as where an object's `actions[]` are configured — states
 * the reason.
 *
 * ## The two halves are deliberately different, and that is the point
 *
 * • The INSPECTOR reads the live held set (`usePermissions`, the same signal
 *   `useCanAuthorMetadata` consumes) and can therefore answer the reported
 *   complaint in the first person: "I configured the buttons and I see none of
 *   them." Cases C/D are one differential — identical draft, identical code
 *   path, only the held set differs.
 * • The PREVIEW is declaration-side only. It renders a draft, not a session,
 *   and its "Where it appears" frames draw the button in every declared
 *   location; before this change that was an unqualified promise, which is the
 *   shape `PlacementPreview`'s own `global_nav` note rules against.
 *
 * ## Paired assertions
 *
 * Every "the notice appears" case is paired with a control over an action that
 * declares NO `requiredPermissions`, so deleting the notice outright cannot
 * turn a negative pin green for the wrong reason. Case F additionally asserts
 * the placement frames still render in the same tree that carries the notice:
 * the notice is an addition, and nothing was traded away for it.
 *
 * ⛔ The end-user side is pinned elsewhere, in the file named above: ruling
 * part (a) is that NOTHING changes there, and a notice leaking into a running
 * app's list surface is the failure this card must not produce.
