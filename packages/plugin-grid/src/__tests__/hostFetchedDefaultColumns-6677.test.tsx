/**
 * objectui#6677 — an object-bound grid whose rows arrive from a HOST must still
 * render the object-schema default-columns policy, not the row payload's keys.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `generateColumns()` has three default paths and used to check them in this
 * order: authored `columns` → the inline-data path → the object-schema path.
 * The inline-data path is gated on `hasInlineData` (`dataConfig.provider ===
 * 'value'`), and `dataConfig` is built as `provider: 'value'` from the `data`
 * PROP before anything else. Its projection is `schemaFields ||
 * Object.keys(inlineData[0])` — the FIRST ROW'S KEYS.
 *
 * A fetching host always passes `data`. `ListView` with no authored columns
 * sends `{ objectName, fields: undefined, columns: undefined }` alongside the
 * rows it fetched, so `schemaFields` is absent and the projection fell all the
 * way through to the payload keys. The object-schema path — the one carrying
 * the documented policy (`highlightFields` first; else drop `hidden`, drop
 * readonly system-managed, push the remaining system/ownership columns to the
 * end) — was unreachable for EVERY object-bound grid reached through a host.
 * The branch that knows the object was the one that never ran.
 *
 * Measured on the same page / source / object with one variable — who fetches:
 *
 *   grid fetches  → 5 columns: Opportunity Name / Stage / Amount / Close Date / Owner
 *   host fetches  → 10 columns: Id, …, Created At, Created By, Updated At, Updated By
 *
 * `id` was `hidden: true` and the bookkeeping fields `system` — exactly what
 * the policy exists to keep off a default list.
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and why the absence half is load-bearing
 *
 * The extras are APPENDED to a superset, not substituted for the five. A test
 * that only checked "the five are present" passes on the broken build too, so
 * the `id`/audit ABSENCE assertions are what make this pin discriminate.
 *
 * ## RED-FIRST — measured on the merge-base (98188c284), this file only
 *
 * 3 red / 4 green. The reds:
 *
 *   ✗ renders the schema policy's five columns, not the payload's ten
 *       → AssertionError: expected [ 'Id', 'Opportunity Name', …(8) ] to
 *         deeply equal [ 'Opportunity Name', 'Stage', …(3) ]
 *   ✗ never appends the payload-only keys once the schema has loaded
 *       → AssertionError: expected [ 'Id', 'Opportunity Name', …(8) ] to have
 *         a length of 5 but got 10
 *   ✗ TRANSITION: the policy takes over once the schema resolves
 *       → AssertionError: expected [ 'Id', 'Opportunity Name', …(8) ] to
 *         deeply equal [ 'Opportunity Name', 'Stage', …(3) ]
 *
 * The elided members are the ten of `PAYLOAD_COLUMNS_LABELLED` below. After the
 * fix, 7 green in the same file.
 *
 * The four greens are boundaries the reorder must not cross — controls, not a
 * restatement of the fix:
 *
 *   - inline data with NO object behind it still derives from the row keys
 *     (the "Legacy support" path is reordered, never deleted);
 *   - an authored `fields` projection is still honoured verbatim when the rows
 *     come from a host — including a key the object schema does not declare.
 *     It is the row-key FALLBACK that yields to the policy, not the whole
 *     path, so an author who asks for an audit column or a host-joined key by
 *     name still gets it;
 *   - first paint with the schema still IN FLIGHT renders the row-key columns
 *     rather than an empty header row. This is the case the naive reorder
 *     (gate the legacy path on `objectName` alone) gets wrong: `objectSchema`
 *     is `null` until an async fetch lands, so that gate falls through to
 *     `if (!objectSchema) return []` and paints ZERO data columns first — a
 *     worse defect than the one being fixed. Pinned in both directions: the
 *     control above holds the first paint, the third red holds the flip.
