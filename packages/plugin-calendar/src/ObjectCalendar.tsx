/**
 * Helper to get calendar configuration from schema.
 *
 * `filter` is the query filter and nothing else (objectui#7711) — the calendar
 * twin of the `filter.map` retirement `ObjectMap` took in objectui#4034.
 *
 * This function used to read the calendar's configuration out of
 * `schema.filter.calendar`, in an arm ABOVE the canonical read below, and the
 * comment on that canonical read called IT the "backward compatibility" one.
 * The contract was inverted there: `@objectstack/spec`'s
 * `ComponentPropsMap['object-calendar']` declares `calendar` as the
 * configuration container and `filter` as the base query filter, and admits no
 * `filter.calendar` spelling at all. Both the arm and that comment are gone —
 * this block consumes only what the spec declares.
 *
 * What the retired arm did: it made ONE authored key mean two incompatible
 * things at once. `filter: { calendar: 'team' }` — a legitimate condition on a
 * field literally named `calendar` — was read here as a `CalendarConfig`,
 * while the very same object still went to `$filter` on the wire below.
 *
 * ⚠️ Measured difference from the map twin, and the reason this retirement
 * needs no dev-time diagnostic rider like plugin-map's
 * `warnOnLegacyFilterMapConfig`:
 * - There is no `Array.prototype.calendar`, so `'calendar' in schema.filter`
 *   never fired on an array-shaped filter — where `'map' in schema.filter`
 *   fired on every single one of them, inherited method and merged `and` node
 *   included. Only an object-shaped filter carrying an own `calendar` key ever
 *   reached the retired arm.
 * - A schema whose only configuration lived under the retired spelling now
 *   returns null from here, and the early return answers null with the
 *   existing "Calendar configuration required. Please specify startDateField
 *   and titleField." refusal screen. The map fell back to DEFAULT field names,
 *   which looks like bad data and is why it had to warn; the calendar names
 *   what is missing on screen. Nothing is dropped without a trace.
 *
 * ⛔ No compatibility rung and no deprecation window, per AGENTS.md #0.1: a
 * tolerant fallback fossilizes the wrong convention into a second de-facto
 * contract. Pinned in `__tests__/ObjectCalendar.filterIsNotAConfigSlot-7711.test.tsx`.

/**
 * The config this component reads: the spec's `CalendarConfig` plus the ONE
 * objectui-local key it also honours.
 *
 * ⭐ Measured, objectui#8026 — `allDayField` is NOT a spec key, and the card
 * that named it "declared by the spec" was reading a different type.
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s `CalendarConfigSchema` is a `strictObject` of exactly
 * four keys (`startDateField`, `endDateField`, `titleField`, `colorField`) and
 * refuses `allDayField` BY NAME with an `unrecognized_keys` diagnostic — on the
 * pinned 17.3.0 and on objectstack `main`. The `@default 'allDay'` doc comment
 * lives on `@object-ui/types`' `CalendarViewSchema`, which is the SIBLING
 * `calendar-view` element's own type, not this one.
 *
 * The lane `allDayField` really rides is objectui's own, and it is deliberate:
 * `@object-ui/types`' `CalendarConfig` mirror derives from the spec schema and
 * keeps `.passthrough()` explicitly for this, naming this key — "the renderers
 * grow config knobs ahead of the protocol (calendar's `allDayField`, for one),
 * and stripping them here would silently disable a shipped capability"
 * (`packages/types/src/zod/objectql.zod.ts`). That is the same class objectui's
 * sanctioned `defaultView` occupies: the spec refuses `defaultView` on this
 * object in exactly the same shape, and this component has honoured it for
 * releases. So honouring `allDayField` widens no accept set — objectui's
 * published validator already admits it, `ListView` already collects it into
 * the fetch, and `ObjectView` already forwards it verbatim.

  // size]` in the spec that owns this shape, and `resolveOverlayWidth` gives an
  // explicit `width` priority OVER `size` — so spelling it kept the deprecated
  // branch load-bearing on the path most calendars take (no declared
  // `navigation`), and made the size buckets unreachable there. Omitting both
  // leaves `resolveOverlayWidth` returning `undefined`, which is what
  // RecordDetailDrawer's own `width` default is for; that default is the
  // identical `min(960px, 60vw)`, so this is a zero-pixel change on every
  // viewport. The absent width is deliberate, not an oversight — do not
  // "restore" it. Pinned by `ObjectCalendar.navWidthDefault.test.tsx`, both
  // halves, because the equivalence now depends on the drawer's default too.

  // literal; no bucket convergence. All four surfaces (gantt, kanban,
  // calendar, RecordDetailDrawer) keep today's pixels. The question is

          makes their absence from the grid honest rather than silent.

          Rendered only when there is something to report: a calendar whose
          records all carry a date looks exactly as it did before.

          ⛔ Deliberately inert, and that is the ruling, not an omission: no
          drag-to-schedule, no date picker, no way to assign a date from here.
          The ruled affordance is a visible count and an expandable list, and
          nothing more. Do not grow this into a scheduling surface without a
          fresh ruling. */}
