/**
 * objectui#5633 — an authored `icon:` literal reaching a record-reading lucide
 * resolver must be a live key of the runtime `icons` record.
 *
 * The class is invisible in BOTH directions. lucide retires a spelling by
 * dropping it from that record while keeping it as a deprecated named export,
 * so the retired name still imports, still type-checks, and still renders where
 * it is used as a COMPONENT — `Edit === SquarePen` and `Filter === Funnel` are
 * both TRUE — and resolves to `null` where it is used as a STRING. It had been
 * repaired twice, in two packages, by two cards, each leaving a LOCAL pin
 * behind (objectui#5586, objectui#5622).
 *
 * What this file pins, in the order the gate can go wrong:
 *
 *  1. **The instrument is not blind.** This whole card exists because the
 *     current tooling reports nothing; a probe that also reports nothing reads
 *     as green. So the predicate is shown REJECTING the exact species it is
 *     for, before any silence of it is quoted.
 *  2. **The discriminating pin and its two controls**, over throwaway trees:
 *     a retired-but-exported name goes red naming the site; a live name at the
 *     same site goes green AND is shown to have been judged; a name that is not
 *     a lucide export at all goes red for a visibly DIFFERENT reason.
 *  3. **It is not a blanket string scan.** The same retired name on a node
 *     whose `type` is not a censused record-reading renderer is declined, not
 *     flagged. A gate that flagged those is a gate that gets suppressed.
 *  4. **The census is measured, not remembered** — an undeclared resolver and a
 *     declared-but-vanished one both fail — and discovery matches the IMPORT,
 *     not the name.
 *  5. **The anchors cannot collapse quietly.** A short read is an error, not
 *     zero violations.
 *  6. **This repository is green, with non-zero counters**, so green is a
 *     judgement rather than a walk that found nothing.
 *  7. **The gate is wired**, and the local pins it replaced are gone.

 *
 * The rule pinned here is the one that closed it: an untyped node's `icon` is
 * judged against its NEAREST TYPED ANCESTOR, and only when that ancestor's
