/**
 * `ObjectGrid`'s record-detail overlay heading still resolves to ENGLISH, and
 * to the SAME BYTES as before, when no `I18nProvider` is mounted —
 * objectui#3426.
 *
 * This is not a nice-to-have. Routing a literal through `t()` without a working
 * default is exactly how a provider-less consumer breaks, and it breaks in a
 * suite that is not this one: `object-grid` is a public page block, so any host
 * that renders schema without mounting a provider (this package's own tests,
 * the preview gallery, an embedding app) reads whatever the defaults map says.
 * The English defaults live in `GRID_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS` (`ObjectGrid.tsx`) —
 * that map is what `createSafeTranslation` falls back to when its `grid.actions`
 * probe comes back unresolved.
 *
 * The byte-identity matters beyond aesthetics: the heading is `Contacts Detail`
 * before the change and `Contacts Detail` after, so e2e specs and host tests
 * that address this chrome by its English name keep addressing it.
 *
 * Direction: this file was GREEN before the change and is GREEN after. It pins
 * the FALLBACK, not the fix — the fix is asserted in
 * `ObjectGrid.overlayTitleI18n.test.tsx`. A missing map entry would have turned
 * it red by rendering the raw key `detail.recordDetailWithLabel`, which is
 * precisely the regression it exists to catch.
 *
 * ── The second describe block has the opposite direction (objectui#9092) ──
 * The `inline locale map label` block below was RED before objectui#9092's grid
 * fix and is GREEN after. It belongs in THIS file rather than in a third one
 * because the defect is path-specific: a map label reaches `[object Object]`
 * through TWO different interpolators, i18next's and this file's provider-less
 * `interpolateFallback` (`i18n/src/fallbackInterpolation.ts`, `String(v)`), and
 * a pin that exercised only the provider path would leave the `String(v)` arm
 * unmeasured. The file-splitting rule below is what makes this arm reachable at
 * all, so it is a reason to keep that rule, not an exception to it.
 *
 * ── Why this is its own FILE, not a describe block ────────────────────────
 * `createI18n` calls `instance.use(initReactI18next)`, and `initReactI18next`
 * registers that instance as **react-i18next's module-global default**. The
 * registration survives unmount and `cleanup()`. So the moment any test in a
 * file mounts `<I18nProvider config={{ defaultLanguage: 'zh' }}>`, every later
 * "no provider" render in that same file silently resolves against the Chinese
 * instance — a green-looking file that asserts nothing about the fallback.
 *
 * Vitest's `dom` project runs with `isolate: true`, so a file that never mounts
 * a provider gets a genuinely clean global. Keep it that way: **do not import
 * or mount `I18nProvider` here.**
