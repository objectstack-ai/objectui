/**
 * objectui#8313 — the four ARRAY/OBJECT-armed `object-kanban` keys the renderer
 * honours are DECLARED authoring surface on every tag it is published under.
 *
 * ## What this file is, and what it deliberately is not
 *
 * This is the DECLARATION half, and it is the direct sibling of
 * `scalarKeysAreDeclaredAndHonoured-8201.test.ts` next door — same rows, same
 * instruments, one slice later. It asserts that `data`, `cardFields`,
 * `grouping` and `conditionalFormatting` are discoverable: the html tier stops
 * reporting them as `unknown-prop`, both registrations publish them, and the
 * strict `ComponentPropsMap` does not refuse them by name.
 *
 * ⛔ It says NOTHING about what is inside any of the four, and it cannot. Its
 * spec row is a KEY verdict — the name is absent from `unrecognized_keys` —
 * which is the right assertion for a discoverability claim and the wrong one
 * for a member claim. Since objectui#8212, an array/object-armed declaration
 * owes a MEMBER claim as well, and that is a separate file:
 * `ObjectKanban.structuredMembersReachTheirSinks-8313.test.tsx`, registered as
 * the `MEMBER_PINS` entry of all four keys. The split is the same one
 * objectui#8176 drew between `filterIsDeclaredInput-7712.test.ts` and
 * `ObjectKanban.filterMembersReachTheWire-8176.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## The rows, and what makes each a reading
 *
 * 1. THE HTML TIER ACCEPTS IT — the real validator over a manifest built from
 *    the LIVE registry (never a hand-written one that could agree with itself),
 *    per tag and PER KEY. Splitting the rows per key is what makes this a
 *    per-registration pin rather than a per-file one: dropping one entry from
 *    `OBJECT_KANBAN_INPUTS` reddens the two rows that NAME that key, not an
 *    opaque file failure.
 * 2. THE CONTROL, on the same call — a prop the component genuinely does not
 *    declare is still reported. Without it, row 1's empty array would also be
 *    produced by a validator that reported nothing at all.
 * 3. THE DECLARATION, read straight off the registry, with `objectName` as its
 *    non-vacuity control, and the declared ARM asserted alongside the name.
 *    The arm is load-bearing here in a way it was not for the scalar slice: it
 *    is what puts the key into the parity gate's `structuredInputs` population
 *    and therefore what makes a `MEMBER_PINS` entry owed at all. A key declared
 *    `string` would publish the same name and quietly owe nothing.
 * 4. THE CONTRACT AGREES — the spec accepts each key (asserted as a KEY
 *    verdict: the name is absent from `unrecognized_keys`) with a bogus key on
 *    the same `safeParse` call proving the zero is a verdict and not a vacuous
 *    read. This row is objectui#8172's lesson made mechanical: `limit` is
 *    taught by four faces and refused BY NAME by this same strict map, so
 *    "the spec declares it" is a claim that must be measured, never assumed.
 * 5. ONE SHARED LIST — both tags are the same renderer, so the declared
 *    surfaces must be the same OBJECT, not two lists that happen to agree.
 *
 * ## What the spec can and cannot supply here, measured
 *
 * Read off `ComponentPropsMap['object-kanban']` on the installed spec: `data`
 * is `z.array(z.unknown()).optional()`, `cardFields` is
 * `z.array(z.string()).optional()`, and `grouping` and `conditionalFormatting`
 * are BOTH `z.unknown().optional()` — exactly like `filter` and `sort`. So for
 * two of the four the contract fixes the container kind and nothing about a
 * member, and for the other two it constrains nothing at all. That is why row 4
 * is a key verdict and why the member file exists: on these keys the read site
 * is the whole of the member contract.
