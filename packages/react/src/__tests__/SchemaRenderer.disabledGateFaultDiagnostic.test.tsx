/**
 * objectui#6445 — the `disabled` / `disabledOn` node gate reports a faulting
 * predicate, in BOTH builds, and says something TRUE about what its fail-soft
 * default did.
 *
 * ## The silence this closes
 *
 * Six legs of `SchemaRenderer`'s visibility chain (`visibleWhen`, `visible`,
 * `visibleOn`, `visibility`, `hidden`, `hiddenOn`) route through
 * `evaluateVisibilityPredicate` and report. These two called
 * `evaluateCondition` BARE — the only uninstrumented predicate pair in the
 * file — so a faulting `disabled` predicate had never been reported in any
 * build, in any dialect that does not report on its own.
 *
 * And it is the pair whose fail-soft default BITES. `evaluateCondition` answers
 * an unevaluable predicate with `true`; on the negated visibility legs that
 * means SHOWN, here it means GREYED OUT. So the user sees a control they cannot
 * use and the author has nothing to grep for — the support ticket the card
 * names ("the Save button is greyed out and I don't know why").
 *
 * ## Observability only — the polarity is NOT this card's to move
 *
 * `evaluateCondition`'s `true` for an unevaluable predicate is existing shipped
 * behaviour, preserved deliberately (the neighbouring family #3862/#3955 landed
 * fail-soft on purpose). Every case below therefore pins the VERDICT beside the
 * line: a faulting `disabled` still disables. A run that made this file green by
 * flipping the gate would fail those pins.
 *
 * ## Why the dedupe is pinned in BOTH directions, and across gates
 *
 * The reporter is rate-limited per `(type, key, predicate source)`
 * (`visibilityDiagnostic.ts`), and #6444 added a second, independent rate limit
 * inside `ExpressionEvaluator` for its own built-in lines. "A warning was
 * emitted" is green on an implementation that emitted fifty; "exactly one was
 * emitted" is green on one that suppresses EVERYTHING after the first line ever
 * printed. Neither pin alone can tell a working dedupe from a broken one, so
 * every dedupe case here pins both halves, and two cases pin the direction this
 * new call site made possible: the SAME predicate source authored on `disabled`
 * and on `visibleWhen` (and on `disabled` and `disabledOn`) must produce TWO
 * lines. Without those, a key that collapsed the gates together would look
 * exactly like a working rate limit.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted BEFORE running)
 *
 * Restoring the bare `evaluator.evaluateCondition(newSchema.disabled)` on both
 * legs — the two lines this card replaces — turns RED every report-count pin in
 * groups 1, 2, 4 and 5 (their counts fall to 0; the CEL and `${…}` cases keep a
 * count but the line becomes the evaluator's own generic one, which carries
 * neither prefix, so the prefix-filtered view is empty there too) and leaves
 * every VERDICT pin and the whole of group 3 GREEN. That asymmetry is the card
 * restated: the change moves the silence, not the answer.
