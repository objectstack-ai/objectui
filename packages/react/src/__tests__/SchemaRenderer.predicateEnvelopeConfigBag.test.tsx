/**
 * objectui#9100 — the CEL envelope must survive the CONFIG-BAG channel too.
 *
 * ## The blind spot this closes
 *
 * `SchemaRenderer.predicateEnvelopeDeclared.test.tsx` (objectui#7530) pins the
 * envelope on `visible` / `hidden` / `disabled` and has been green since it
 * landed — but every one of its mounts writes the key at NODE level
 * (`{ type, visible: envelope }`). Nothing runs over a node-level key.
 *
 * The SPEC spelling is `properties` (and its legacy alias `props`), which is
 * what a published artifact and both `/api/v1/meta/*` endpoints actually emit,
 * and that channel goes through the per-value evaluation loops in the
 * evaluation memo. Those loops handed every value to
 * `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluate`, whose FIRST action is to unwrap any
 * `{ source: string }` object down to its bare `source` — the unwrap that
 * makes a `template` envelope interpolate. Applied to a `cel` PREDICATE it is
 * destructive: the envelope is the only thing that routes `evaluateCondition`
 * to the canonical `@objectstack/formula` engine, and the loop runs BEFORE the
 * hoist, so the node gate below it and the renderer one layer under it both
 * received a bare string and both took the legacy JS path.
 *
 * So the two channels disagreed about one key, which is precisely the class
 * objectui#5123 ruled on ("one answer per key, whichever channel reads it") —
 * and the half that was broken was the canonical one.
 *
 * ## Why the predicate carries a CEL stdlib call
 *
 * A predicate that both engines can evaluate cannot detect the routing: the
 * legacy JS engine binds `record` / `data` perfectly well, and the card's own
 * browser ablation is what established that. What it cannot do is the CEL
 * stdlib. `has(…)` is therefore not decoration — it is the discriminator, and
 * a predicate without one would leave this file green on the broken tree.
 *
 * ## Both polarities, because they fail in OPPOSITE directions
 *
 * `evaluateCondition`'s fail-soft answer is `true` on every internal path. The
 * four SHOW legs negate it, so a broken gate RENDERS (fail-open — measured in
 * a real browser on `record:alert`); the two HIDE legs return it un-negated,
 * so a broken gate makes the node VANISH (fail-closed). Both were live here
 * and both are pinned below, because a one-polarity suite would have passed
 * on half of the defect.
