/**
 * ObjectUI — one authority per exported schema name (objectui#6273)
 *
 * ## The ruling this enforces
 *
 * The 2026-08-25 maintainer family ruling (decision 甲/A1 on objectui#6172,
 * verbatim acceptance 「同意」): **every exported schema name has exactly one
 * authority.** objectui#6172 (`FormField`, `MarkdownSchema`, `KanbanSchema`),
 * objectui#6155 (`KanbanCard` ×4) and objectui#6086 are the same defect
 * measured four times — one name, two structurally different declarations, and
 * an IDE auto-import that picks between them by alphabetical order. The wrong
 * pick does not surface as "you imported from the wrong package"; it surfaces
 * as a remote `TS2322` several lines away, which is what
 * `packages/plugin-calendar/src/__tests__/name-collision-5044.test.ts` records
 * for `CalendarEvent`.
 *
 * The cleanup cards fix instances. This file is the recurrence guard the
 * ruling ordered: it re-derives the collision set from source on every test
 * run, so the class cannot silently regrow after they land.
 *
 * ## What counts as an AUTHORITY, and what deliberately does not
 *
 * An authority is a site that gives an exported name its meaning. Two of them
 * in two different files means two meanings for one published name.
 *
 *   - **A declaration** — `export interface X`, `export type X`,
 *     `export enum X` (and their `declare` / `const enum` spellings). This is
 *     the shape every card in the family measured.
 *   - **An aliasing re-export that PUBLISHES a name** —
 *     `export type { A as X } from './a'`. It is not a declaration, but it
 *     puts a second meaning behind the name `X`, which is what the ruling is
 *     about. `packages/plugin-calendar/src/index.tsx` is today's live
 *     instance: it publishes the runtime `CalendarViewEvent` as
 *     `CalendarEvent`, a name `@object-ui/types` already declares.
 *
 * ⛔ **A deliberate re-export is NOT an authority.** `export { X } from './x'`,
 * `export type { X } from './x'`, `export * from './x'` and
 * `export * as ns from './x'` are ONE declaration with many export sites —
 * exactly how this monorepo is meant to fan a type out through barrels. A gate
 * that counted those would red on every package's `src/index.ts`, and an
 * assertion that reds on legitimate code gets deleted by the first person who
 * hits it, which puts the claim back where it started. `X as X` is a plain
 * re-export spelled long, and is skipped for the same reason.
 *
 * ⛔ **Near-spellings and derived names are NOT collisions.** The matcher
 * anchors the name on both ends, so `ConditionalFormattingRule` does not match
 * `KanbanConditionalFormattingRule` (`packages/types/src/objectql.ts:2202`) or
 * `KanbanNativeConditionalFormattingRule` (same file, :2181) — both of which
 * this repository really writes, next to the contested name.
 *
 * ## Two stated bounds, because a claim must be bounded or derivable
 *
 * (The 2026-08-25 batch-adjudication close-out, decision B1.)
 *
 *  1. **Type-level names only.** `export const`, `export function` and
 *     `export class` are out. The ruling's subject is the schema/type
 *     vocabulary, and the value namespace is a different population with a
 *     different remedy — 66 exported classes and every exported helper would
 *     arrive as noise the same run. Narrowing the claim and narrowing the
 *     population is one change; ⛔ never narrow one alone.
 *  2. **Alias sites are counted only where the alias is TYPE-marked** —
 *     `export type { A as X }` or `export { type A as X }`. This is lossless
 *     rather than a heuristic: the root `tsconfig.json` sets
 *     `"isolatedModules": true` and every package extends it, so a type
 *     re-export MUST carry the `type` marker to compile at all. (This
 *     named the tier base instead until objectui#9330 measured that no
 *     package extends that file — the option is repo-wide all the same,
 *     it just comes from the root config.) It also keeps a VALUE alias
 *     (`export { helper as Grid }`) from reddening against an unrelated
 *     `interface Grid` in the type namespace.
 *
 * A collision additionally requires at least one real DECLARATION among the
 * sites: two aliases publishing one name, with nothing declaring it, is a
 * different (and today empty) shape and is not what the ruling measured.
 *
 * ## ONE mask, and why — this differs from the sibling gate on purpose
 *
 * `scripts/__tests__/unconsumed-widget-option-claim-6186.test.ts` needs TWO
 * masks, because a computed access spells its key AS a string literal
 * (`x['thresholds']`) and blanking literals would erase the thing it looks
 * for. Nothing here has that property: a declaration and an export clause are
 * both CODE in every spelling they have, so this scan reads source with
 * comments AND string literals blanked, and there is no leg that needs
 * literals to survive. That single mask is what lets this file scan a
 * population containing `packages/create-plugin/src/templates.ts`, which
 * writes `export interface ${'$'}{vars.pascalName}Schema extends BaseSchema {`
 * inside a template literal (:417) — content, not a declaration — without
 * reddening on it.
 *
 * It is also the answer to the failure the sibling gate hit the moment it was
 * committed: **it reddened on its own source**, because a tracked-files
 * population first contained its own fixture table. The discriminator here is
 * real rather than a filename exemption, and it is proved twice below:
 * `authoritySites` is run over THIS FILE's own bytes and must find nothing
 * (masking alone is sufficient), and the population is bounded to the
 * published packages' `src/` because that is what the claim is about —
 * `scripts/` publishes nothing.
 *
 * ## What the instrument cannot see — read before trusting a verdict
 *
 *   - **A name assembled at runtime.** This is a text scan; nothing textual
 *     can see a type produced by a mapped/conditional type or a generated
 *     `.d.ts`. Generated output is untracked, so it is out by construction.
 *   - **Whether the two shapes actually disagree.** The card asks for
 *     "declared more than once with disagreeing shapes"; this gate answers
 *     "declared more than once", which is the decidable half. Structural
 *     comparison across two packages needs the type checker, and a name with
 *     two AGREEING declarations is still two authorities that drift
 *     independently — so the stricter reading is also the correct one.
 *   - **Whether a colliding name is reachable from its package's public
 *     entry.** The export graph is not walked. That over-includes a
 *     module-local `export interface` — deliberately, because the family cards
 *     counted exactly that way: objectui#6155's `KanbanCard ×4` includes
 *     `KanbanEnhanced.tsx` and `KanbanImpl.tsx`, neither of which is a barrel.
 *     Population and claim have to stay co-extensive with the cards they guard.
 *
 * ## The baseline is a RATCHET, in both directions
 *
 * `KNOWN_COLLISIONS` is today's measured population, named site by site,
 * taken on `79ebf30d1`. The card allows landing with it and requires it to
 * SHRINK as objectui#6172 / #6169 / #6170 / #6155 land; ⛔ silently exempting
 * these forever is not allowed, so the reconciliation below fails in BOTH
 * directions — a new name or a new site is fresh debt, and a listed site that
 * no longer collides is a stale entry that must be deleted in the same PR that
 * cleaned it. Without that second direction a baseline degrades into a
 * skip-list nobody dares touch (`scripts/check-skills-paths.mjs` and
 * `scripts/check-doc-fence-languages.mjs` carry the same rule).
 *
 * ⛔ Adding a line is not a supported way to make this pass.
