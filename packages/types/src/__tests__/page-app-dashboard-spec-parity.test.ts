/**
 * Page / App / Dashboard ↔ `@objectstack/spec` drift guard (objectstack#4115).
 *
 * These three renderer nodes extend `BaseSchema`, which is `.passthrough()`,
 * while their spec counterparts are strict. That combination is the objectui
 * equivalent of the objectstack#4120 silent-drop failure: every spec-only key
 * — `branding`, `sharing`, `interfaceConfig`, `source`, `header`,
 * `performance`, the whole `_lock*` package envelope — rode through
 * *completely unvalidated*, so `brading: {…}` was indistinguishable from
 * `branding: {…}` and a spec-authored `kind: 'html'` page could not even
 * express its body (`source` was never declared).
 *
 * The fix is NOT `.strict()` — these are component nodes and the open envelope
 * is deliberate. It is to let the spec's own fields flow in by reference
 * (`SpecXFields = SpecXSchema.omit({…}).partial()`), the pattern
 * `zod/objectql.zod.ts`'s `ListViewSchema` already uses.
 *
 * The derivation picks up new spec fields automatically, but can still break
 * silently in three ways, which these tests catch:
 *
 *   1. The spec grows a field objectui never triaged. Asserted: every spec key
 *      is present in the objectui shape, or envelope-owned by BaseSchema.
 *   2. The spec renames/removes a field objectui deliberately omits and
 *      re-declares locally — the local override would then shadow nothing.
 *      Asserted: every omitted anchor still exists upstream.
 *   3. Someone adds an objectui-local key that should have been a spec field.
 *      Asserted: every objectui-only key is in the sanctioned set below.
 *
 * When one fails, do NOT edit the sets to make it green — decide whether the
 * field belongs upstream in `@objectstack/spec` or is a genuine objectui-only
 * extension, and record the reason.
