/**
 * The bare `kanban` NODE TYPE key is retired, and a document naming it is
 * refused BY NAME (objectui#8802 — maintainer ruling 2026-09-09, verbatim and
 * untranslated: 「从我们的业务需求角度，我应该只需要 `object-kanban`」).
 *
 * ## What it supersedes, and why those files are gone rather than edited
 *
 * Two pin files had the retired arm as their whole subject and are replaced by
 * this one — the third disposition in fixture triage, "the fixture pins exactly
 * the branch you deleted", where an edit would have left assertions that keep
 * passing because nothing is produced any more:
 *
 *   - `kanban-arm-batch70-7742.test.ts` — batch #70's four arm-scoped refusals
 *     (`allowCollapse` / `cardTemplates` / `columnWidths` / `titleField`) and
 *     its one widening (`navigation`). Every one of them was a claim about
 *     `type: 'kanban'` documents, which no longer exist.
 *   - `kanban-plugin-dialect-authoritative-7664.test.ts` — that the `'kanban'`
 *     arm declared the plugin dialect, that `SchemaRegistry['kanban']` named
 *     it, and a 20-member census of it.
 *
 * ⭐ The one claim inside them that was NOT about the retired arm is carried
 * forward here as suite 3: the SIBLING `object-kanban` arm's verdicts must not
 * move. That is what turns this from a deletion into a retirement.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The mechanism, which is NOT the passthrough rule
 *
 * `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`, so a dropped MEMBER key is KEPT, not
 * refused — the failure objectui#7664's first cut shipped at `onCardClick`.
 * ⛔ That rule does not govern a TYPE LITERAL. `AnyComponentSchema` is a
 * DISCRIMINATED union (objectui#8498), so it selects one arm from the authored
 * literal and an unclaimed literal matches nothing: deleting the arm would
 * already refuse. What deleting would NOT do is say why or what to write
 * instead — the union answers a missed discriminator with its own remedy-free
 * `Invalid input`. So the arm stays, claiming the literal, and refuses through
 * `retiredNodeType()`. Suite 1 measures the refusal AND its remedy; suite 4
 * measures that the generic path is still what an unknown literal gets, which
 * is the control that separates the two.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The layer this retirement does NOT touch
 *
 * `kanban` also names a STORED `NamedListView.type` — the value
 * `CreateViewDialog` writes and every tenant's database holds. Suite 5 pins that
 * it is still admitted, because a migration that pattern-matched the string
 * would have rewritten it and broken every stored kanban view in every
 * deployment. `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView` maps a stored `kanban` view onto the
 * `object-kanban` NODE type, so this retirement moves zero stored documents.
