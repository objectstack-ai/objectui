/**
 * Every timestamp face on the record page reads the DECLARED session locale,
 * never the machine's (objectui#9786).
 *
 * ## The contract, and the sentence being honoured
 *
 * `useDisplayLocale` states the rule in its own doc comment: the one thing a
 * caller must not do is reach past the hook and hand `Intl` the `undefined` it
 * gets on an unconfigured workspace, because `undefined` means "the MACHINE's
 * locale, which is neither channel". objectui#9453 put the `summaryFields`
 * chip on the hook; this file covers the timeline / history / diff / footer
 * surfaces in the same package, which were still passing nothing at all.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Why every family is measured as a DIFFERENCE, not as a literal
 *
 * A literal expectation measures the runner, not the code: on a `de-DE`
 * machine a broken surface and a repaired one print the same bytes. Each
 * family below therefore renders the SAME stored instant twice — once under a
 * declared `de-DE` session, once under a declared `en` one — and requires the
 * two readings to DIFFER. Before this card both readings came from the
 * machine, whatever it was, so they were byte-identical on every runner
 * including a German one.
 *
 * Only the tenant locale moves between the two mounts: the UI language stays
 * `en` in both, so every translated string is identical and the only thing
 * that can make the two readings differ is the `Intl` tag.
 *
 * ## ⭐ What a source grep CANNOT see, and why the tripwire exists
 *
 * The card's census instrument matched `toLocaleDateString()` with no argument
 * and `Intl.*Format(undefined`. That shape is blind to a call that passes a
 * VARIABLE which happens to be `undefined` at runtime — and this package had
 * exactly one: `HistoryTimeline`'s optional `locale` prop reached
 * `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat(locale, …)` and neither of its two call sites
 * passed it, so the prop's own doc comment declared the defect ("Defaults to
 * browser locale"). `recordLocaleArguments` below closes that hole by
 * observing the ARGUMENT every `Intl` constructor and every
 * `Date.prototype.toLocale*` call actually receives while a surface renders.
 * It sees through variables, spreads and defaults, which no grep does.
 *
 * `machineLocaleCensus-9786.test.ts` is the other half: it reddens when a NEW
 * bare or hard-coded site is written anywhere in this package's source.
