 * objectui#9151 — "a failed script action renders no toast", characterized
 * END TO END through the console's real failure chain.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The question "does a server refusal on `POST /api/v1/actions/...` reach the
 * user?" was re-derived from scratch by three separate readers, each by
 * reading code rather than running it, and each answer was a theory. It is a
 * measurable question, so it is measured here once and kept measured.
 *
 * The chain under test is the real one, with nothing stubbed between its ends:
 *
 *   ActionRunner.execute
 *     -> the registered `script` handler
 *        = createConsoleServerActionHandler   (this package)
 *        -> createServerActionHandler         (@object-ui/core)
 *           -> interpretActionResponse        (the /actions envelope rule)
 *     -> ActionRunner.handlePostExecution     (the toast sink)
 *
 * Only the transport (`fetch`) and the toast SINK are test doubles. The sink
 * double stands in for the console's `toastHandler`, which is one `switch` on
 * `options.type` in `useConsoleActionRuntime` and a byte-identical copy in
 * `RecordDetailView`; asserting on the payload handed to the sink pins the
 * contract without copying that mapping into a third place.
 *
 * ## What the readings establish
 *
 * 1. A 500 carrying a business sentence produces exactly ONE toast, typed
 *    `error`, carrying that sentence VERBATIM.
 * 2. The identical body under 400 produces the identical toast. The path is
 *    status-blind by construction (`!res.ok`), which is why moving a refusal
 *    from 500 to 4xx — objectstack#17265 / PR objectstack#17679 — changes
 *    nothing on this path, and why it must not be "fixed" by teaching the
 *    console to branch on status.
 * 3. An unreadable body still produces exactly one error toast, on the
 *    `(HTTP nnn)` fallback. So `result.error` is never empty after a non-ok
 *    response, and the zero-toast symptom cannot originate in this chain.
 *
 * ⇒ The preimage of "zero toast elements" is therefore CLOSED, and the last
 * two cases below are the whole of it:
 *
 *   A. the action declares `toast: { showOnError: false }` — an authorable
 *      per-action opt-out that the runner honours; or
 *   B. a handler returns `{ success: false }` with NO `error` — the deliberate
 *      "I already messaged the user" convention (`useObjectActions`'s bulk
 *      delete, `useConsoleActionRuntime`'s entitlement dialog).
 *
 * Anything else that renders no toast is dispatching outside this chain.
