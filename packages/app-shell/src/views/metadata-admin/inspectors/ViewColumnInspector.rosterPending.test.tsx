/**
 * objectui#8862, end to end — the frame the card was filed about.
 *
 * `ViewColumnInspector` builds its field roster from `useObjectFields`, which
 * answers over the network. While that request is out, `objectFields` is `[]`,
 * and `InspectorSelectField` used to read an empty roster as proof of absence:
 * a column bound to a REAL field of the object rendered as
 * `FIELDKEY (not in object)` for the length of the round trip, then settled to
 * the field's own label. The marker is an assertion about the author's data on
 * the authoring surface, and for that window it was false — the plausible
 * author response is to re-author a binding that was already correct.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Why the whole chain is mounted instead of the primitive alone
 *
 * `_shared.rosterPending.test.tsx` pins the primitive's tri-state by handing it
 * `loading` directly. That leaves one seam untested: whether this call site
 * actually PASSES the signal its hook already publishes. A fix to the
 * primitive with the prop unthreaded here is green there and still ships the
 * defect, so this suite drives the real hook against a metadata client whose
 * promise is held open, and reads the trigger in that frame.
 *
 * ## The pin is the IN-FLIGHT frame, not the settled one
 *
 * The settled frame was never wrong — it was correct before this change and is
 * correct after it — so a test that lets the roster land before asserting is
 * green on the defect too. The two cases that carry the repair therefore read
 * the trigger BEFORE resolving the client, and only then resolve it to pin what
 * it settles to. The third is the true negative and deliberately does the
 * opposite; the note on it says why.
 *
 * ## ⛔ What the existing pin on this exact string does NOT cover
 *
 * `ViewColumnInspector.identityRead.test.tsx` already asserts
 * `'name (not in object)'` is absent, and that case is green on the defect: its
 * draft binds NO object, so `useObjectFields` short-circuits and reports
 * `loading: false` on the first render — the roster is answered-and-empty, not
 * unanswered — and its legacy `{accessorKey, header}` column yields no field
 * key at all, so the control it reads is an `<input>` rather than this
 * combobox. It pins the retired-alias read; it says nothing about this window.
