 * objectui#5203 — the produced inbox row carries exactly what it declares.
 *
 * ## What this is the other half of
 *
 * `InboxNotification` (`layout/inboxGrouping.ts`) used to declare an
 * `actor_name` that was dead at both ends: `mergeInboxRows` below never mapped
 * it, neither consumer (`InboxPopover`, `useHomeInbox`) read it, and
 * `sys_inbox_message` then had no actor column for it to be mapped FROM. The
 * declaration was removed; `inboxGrouping.test.ts` carries the TYPE PIN that
 * stops it being re-declared.
 *
 * ## The actor that DID come back, and why that is not a reversal
 *
 * objectui#8667 adds `actor_id` to the mapped set. The objectui#5203 retirement
 * rested on "no column to map from", and for an actor ID that stopped being
 * true when `sys_inbox_message` gained the `actor_id` lookup
 * (objectstack#16974). It is still true for a NAME, so `actor_name` stays out
 * and the second case below still holds. The route is the one this suite
 * exists to enforce: one more EXPLICIT field in the producer's literal and one
 * more entry in `DECLARED_KEYS`, never a pass-through.
 *
 * A type pin alone cannot see the direction this contract is most likely to rot
 * in, because that direction does not go through the type at all: the producer
 * builds its row from an explicit field-by-field literal, and the cheap
 * "improvement" is to spread the raw `sys_inbox_message` record into it
 * (`{ ...m, is_read }`). That compiles, it is invisible to `tsc`, and it
 * silently re-admits every raw column the backend happens to grow — including
 * an `actor_name` — as an undeclared de-facto field on the UI shape. So this
 * suite feeds the producer a raw row LOADED with columns it does not map and
 * asserts the produced row's key set, not just the absence of one key.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted BEFORE running, measured in this PR)
 *
 *   - replace the producer's explicit literal with a `{ ...m }` pass-through ⇒
 *     both cases here go RED (extra keys present, `actor_name` among them),
 *     while the `inboxGrouping.test.ts` type pin stays GREEN — which is why the
 *     type pin cannot stand in for this one, and both are here;
 *   - re-declare `actor_name` on `InboxNotification` ⇒ this suite stays GREEN
 *     (a declaration nobody fills changes no runtime shape) and the type pin
 *     goes RED. Opposite directions, one per instrument.
