 * Root keys that positively identify a file as an ObjectUI schema node.

 * exception, `body`, which objectui#6771 retired to a `?: never` tombstone.
 * ⛔ It stays in this list ON PURPOSE and the distinction is the whole point of
 * the list: this is a file-IDENTIFICATION marker, not an accept set. A file
 * authored under the retired spelling must still be RECOGNISED as an ObjectUI
 * node, so that the tier can refuse it by name; drop the marker and the same
 * file stops being judged at all, which is the silence the retirement ends.
 * ⇒ read this set as "keys that identify the vocabulary", which is a superset
 * of "keys you may author". Otherwise it is read out of the protocol's own
 * node contract, not invented here, and it is closed: it grows only when
 * `BaseSchema` grows.
 *
 * `BaseSchema`'s remaining properties are deliberately absent because their
 * NAMES are generic enough to head foreign root vocabularies, and a marker
 * that matches a foreign file re-creates the exact defect this gate exists to
 * remove. Measured over this repository (objectui#5127): `name` appears at the
 * root of 45 of the 46 foreign judged files and `description` at 44 — both are
 * `package.json` keys — so admitting `BaseSchema` wholesale takes the foreign
 * retention from 0 files to all 46. `id`, `label`, `data` and `type` itself are
 * held out on the same reasoning.

/**
 * ⛔ There is deliberately NO `$schema` arm, and no ObjectUI `$schema` URL
 * exists to declare.
 *
 * An earlier revision of this file admitted a file whose root `$schema` had an
 * `objectui.org` host, completed by a canonical URL proposed for the
 * maintainer to confirm. The maintainer ruled against minting that identifier
 * (2026-08-20, objectui#5127, verbatim 「C」), superseding the `$schema` half of
 * the 2026-08-19 ruling. The structural arm below is unaffected and stands.
 *
 * - A `$schema` URL is a permanent public identifier that lives in USERS'
 *   files, which no sweep can ever reach. Minting the address before the
 *   document it names exists is backwards.
 * - The only consumer that needs a URL rather than any agreed marker is an
 *   editor resolving `$schema` over HTTP. An agent authoring schemas instead
 *   needs a contract it can read BEFORE writing — a file, and `node_modules`
 *   is right there — and a good error AFTER writing, which is this command,
 *   already version-correct from the installed packages.
 * - The value would be untyped, unchecked and host-matched, so an agent that
 *   mis-remembered the path would be silently accepted: a version-fossil
 *   generator, in files we cannot fix.
 * - Zero files declared it, in this repository or anywhere else, so the arm
 *   matched nothing. Dropping it gives up no coverage that was being
 *   delivered.
 *
 * Because that matching was host-based rather than literal, the arm can be
 * added later without invalidating a single file. The trigger that clause once
 * pointed at is gone: `@object-ui/types` shipping a generated JSON Schema was
 * objectui#5392, and the maintainer ruled it Option B on 2026-08-25 — no
 * shipped artifact. There is therefore no document a `$schema` URL could name,
 * and the recall that arm was being kept in reserve for is repaid instead by
 * the validity arm below, which reads the Zod schemas already in
 * `node_modules` rather than a URL fetched over HTTP.
 */

/**
 * Does this parsed file positively read as an ObjectUI schema (objectui#5127,
 * objectui#6075)?
 *
 * `type` carries at least seven unrelated vocabularies in JSON — the most
 * common of them being `package.json`'s `"type": "module"` — so the presence
 * of a root `type` is not evidence that a file is a UI schema. Before this
 * gate, `objectui check` judged every root `type` against the component-key
 * universe and the FIRST line a user saw in their own project was a warning
 * about their own `package.json`: 45 of the 46 warnings this repository
 * produced were exactly that.
 *
 * The fix is a positive marker, not a consumer-side skip list: a file is
 * judged when it is recognisable as an ObjectUI node. A list of filenames to
 * exclude was considered and rejected — it is a second hand-maintained list of
 * the shape objectui#5115 had just finished deleting, and it can only ever
 * enumerate the foreign vocabularies someone already thought of.
 *
 * There are two arms, and the ORDER is load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. The structural arm (`OBJECTUI_STRUCTURAL_KEYS`, above) — a set-membership
 *    test over the parsed root, and the cheap one. It runs first so the
 *    common case never pays for arm 2.
 * 2. The validity arm — the document parses as an ObjectUI component schema
 *    under `@object-ui/types`' own Zod union. This is the recogniser the
 *    2026-08-25 ruling on objectui#5392 selected (Option B, no shipped schema
 *    artifact): measured over this repository it admits schemas the structural
 *    arm cannot see — leaf nodes that carry only their own vocabulary — while
 *    refusing every `package.json`, because `"module"` is not a component the
 *    protocol models.
 *
 * ⛔ There is deliberately no third arm reading a registered root `type`
 * alone. `{ "name": "x", "type": "form" }` is a plausible `package.json` and
 * `form` is a real component key; admitting on the type name re-creates the
 * exact defect this gate exists to remove. Recognition needs SHAPE.
 *
 * ⚠️ The validity arm couples this command's recall to `@object-ui/types`:
 * tightening a Zod schema moves files out of recognition. That is not a
 * hazard left to chance — it is the reason `check` reports a third bucket
 * rather than two (see `UNVALIDATED_CANDIDATE` below). A file that stops
 * validating stops being *judged*, but it does not stop being *mentioned*.

/**
 * `UNVALIDATED_CANDIDATE` — the bucket a validity-based recogniser MUST report
 * rather than swallow (objectui#6075).
 *
 * A recogniser built on validation conflates two entirely different findings:
 * "this file is not ours" and "this file is ours and it is broken". The second
 * is the more valuable of the two — it is the thing this command exists to
 * find — and filing it under the first makes it vanish. The symptom of that
 * bug is an ABSENCE: the file simply stops being mentioned, and nothing
 * prompts a re-read.
 *
 * It is not a theoretical bucket. Measured over a clean checkout of this
 * repository at the commit that introduced this function, 100 eligible files
 * failed the validity arm; 54 of those land here, and 53 of the 54 are real
 * ObjectUI content — schema-catalog leaves such as
 * `{ "type": "text", "content": "Small text", "variant": "small" }`, whose
 * `variant` is not in `TextSchema`'s enum. Reported as foreign, all 53 would
 * have gone quiet.
 *
 * The discriminator is `isKnownSchemaType`: does the root `type` name a
 * component THIS BUILD registers? It is the same derived universe the
 * judgement arm uses, so it needs no second list, and it is the one signal
 * that separates a broken `"type": "text"` node from `"type": "module"`.
 *
 * Its cost, stated rather than hidden: a foreign document whose root `type`
 * happens to collide with a registered component key lands here. A JSON Schema
 * document with `"type": "object"` is exactly that, and this repository
 * contains one. The cost is one advisory line naming a file — not a warning
 * about the reader's `package.json`, which is the failure this gate was built
 * for. The opposite error is the one that cannot be seen.
 *
 * ⛔ This bucket is REPORTED, never counted as skipped. Moving files from the
 * skipped count into an unreported bucket would make the recall debt look
 * repaid while nothing had been repaid, which is the one outcome objectui#6075
 * names as unacceptable.
