 * gets away with the runtime import only because nothing in

 * Anti-drift is a TEST, not this comment: `ListView.mapFlatten.test.tsx` pins
 * this exact list against `ObjectMapConfigSchema.shape` — imported only from
 * that TEST file, which the alias-closure walker explicitly excludes from

 * rule: `kanban`, `calendar`, `gallery`, `timeline` and `gantt` each spread
 * `schema.options?.<kind>` FIRST and `schema.<kind>` LAST, which is a per-key

 * differs, and this follows the five that merge, which are also the five that
 * flatten config into props the way the map branch does.)

 * Both sides go through the same whitelist, so the typed block cannot
 * reintroduce the `style` namespace collision that objectui#5177 closed.
 *

 * What a list view's `chart` block binds to — resolved ONCE, for both readers.
 *
 * `case 'chart'` below routes on `shape` and reads the fields; the capability
 * gate in `availableViews` reads `resolves`. One function, because the gate's
 * question ("is this chart offerable?") is the render branch's own question
 * ("can I bind this block?") and a second copy of it drifts (objectui#7544;
 * the same class of drift objectui#7495 tracks elsewhere).
 *
 * The gate had NO chart check at all before #7544: `chart` entered `resolvable`
 * only via the "always allow switching back to the schema viewType" leg, so a
 * `grid` view declaring a complete block and whitelisting `['grid', 'chart']`
 * had its own `appearance.allowedVisualizations` filtered to nothing and fell
 * back to `['grid']` (ADR-0047, whitelist ∩ resolvable). Same shape and same
 * fix as `map`'s (objectui#5042, `resolveListMapConfig` above).
 *
 * PRECEDENCE is the render branch's existing one, not a new rule: the
 * view-level block replaces the legacy `options.chart` bag WHOLESALE (`||`) —
 * `chart` and `tree` are the two visualizations in this file that replace
 * rather than merge, and the gate inherits whichever the renderer uses so the
 * two can never judge different configs.
 *
 * `resolves` is the "renders from names the AUTHOR wrote" question, one leg per
 * shape:
 *   - ADR-0021 (#1890): a `dataset` with at least one measure in `values`. The
 *     dimensions are what it plots BY, and a block may legitimately declare
 *     none (a single aggregate), so they are not required here.
 *   - legacy: a declared category (`xAxisField` / `categoryField`) AND a
 *     declared measure (`yAxisFields[0]` / `valueField`) — exactly what the
 *     legacy leg reads BEFORE its `'name'` / `'value'` floors. A block that
 *     declares neither reaches the renderer only through the schema-viewType
 *     leg, where those floors invent a binding; retiring THAT is objectui#7547
 *     (the #7029 / #7070 family) and is out of scope here. The gate simply

/**
 * The list view's props.

 * ## Why there is no `[key: string]: any` here (objectui#4528)
 *
 * There used to be one, and it erased this entire interface. A string index
 * signature puts `string` into `keyof Props`, so `'ref' extends keyof Props` is
 * always true and React's `PropsWithoutRef` takes its `Omit` branch — and
 * `Omit` over a type carrying a string index signature keeps ONLY the index
 * signature. Every declared property below was dropped from the resolved type.
 * Measured on the pre-fix source:
 * `keyof React.ComponentProps< typeof ListView >` was `string | number`, and
 * `React.ComponentProps< typeof ListView >['onRowClick']` was `any`, while this
 * interface went on declaring `(record: Record< string, unknown >) => void`.
 *
 * The same trap, in `packages/components`, is objectui#4422 / PR #4438; this is
 * the sweep of the two packages that issue left unswept.
 *
 * ## The props that were only ever reachable through it
 *
 * `ListView` reads several props it never declared, because the index signature
 * was answering for them — `dataSource`, `onAddRecord`, `onBulkAction`,
 * `onPageSizeChange` are read directly, and `onEdit` / `onDelete` /
 * `onBulkDelete` ride the `{...props}` forward into the active view component
 * (`ObjectGrid` declares all three). They are declared by name below, at the
 * type each one actually lands on, rather than left to an index signature that
 * types them `any` and erases everything around them.

  /**
   * [objectui#4420] The PER-RECORD half of the same key, for the same bar.
   *
   * `permittedBulkActions` above reads `userActions.delete` as a BOOLEAN — the
   * object-level verdict — and that is all it ever read. Since objectui#2614
   * the key also accepts `{ enabled?, visibleWhen?, disabledWhen? }`, whose
   * `visibleWhen` gates the affordance **per record**; the row kebab has
   * honoured it since, and this bar did not. Tick only a record the predicate
   * excludes and the bar still offered the red Delete — the same declared key
   * meaning two different things on two surfaces.
   *
   * ## What was ruled (maintainer, 2026-08-17 — behaviour 1 of three)
   *
   * Filter the operation and report the skipped. The bar evaluates
   * `visibleWhen` once per selected record, Delete runs over the allowed
   * SUBSET, and the excluded records are reported rather than silently
   * dropped. Two rejected alternatives, restated because each is a way to
   * misread this code: the button is **never hidden or disabled** by the
   * predicate (behaviour 2 — one stray tick would disable the whole bar), and
   * the predicate is **not** declared out of scope for set operations
   * (behaviour 3 — the key must not mean different things on two surfaces).
   * A selection where EVERY row is excluded therefore still renders the
   * button; what the user gets is a legible refusal, not an absence.
   *
   * ## Why `evalRowPredicate`, never `useRowPredicate`
   *
   * A bulk gate evaluates N records in a LOOP, and React forbids a hook per
   * iteration. `partitionRowsByPredicate` is that loop — the shared,
   * fail-closed fold in `@object-ui/core` that the grid's own bulk bar reads
   * through `partitionBulkRows`, so the two bars cannot drift on what
   * "eligible" means.
   *
   * ## Why `objectDef`, and only the built-in `delete`
   *
   * The predicates come off the OBJECT's `userActions` block (the CRUD
   * predicate vocabulary), never the VIEW's `schema.userActions` (toolbar
   * policy) — the same name collision `toolbarFlags` above is pinned against.
   * Only the built-in `delete` entry is filtered: custom action ids route
   * through the action runner carrying their own gates, exactly as the
   * object-level gate above leaves them alone.

  /**
   * [#4647] Is the grid toolbar's inline-edit toggle offered at all?
   *
   * Two gaps closed together, because both end at this one render condition.
   *
   * ## Gap 1 — the permission gate
   *
   * The toggle used to render on the sole conditions "grid view", "the host
   * wired `onInlineEditChange`" and "not the compact toolbar" — and every host
   * passes that callback unconditionally. It was the ONE affordance on this
   * toolbar with no permission check: New and Import are hidden for an account
   * without the grant, the bulk-delete entry directly above ANDs
   * `can(obj, 'delete')`, and inline edit alone stayed available to a read-only
   * principal, who could flip it, edit cells and press "Save all" to earn a
   * server 403. No data ever landed (the server gate is solid), but the UI
   * walked the user through a round-trip guaranteed to fail.
   *
   * The gate is `permittedBulkActions`' verbatim, with the operation moved from
   * `delete` to `update`: the object's resolved affordance — ADR-0103 bucket ∧
   * `userActions.edit` ∧ the server's effective API operations (#3391) — AND
   * the CURRENT PRINCIPAL's grant (#4096). The first half is spelled
   * `isObjectInlineEditable`, which IS
   * `resolveEffectiveCrudAffordances(...).edit` under the name that says what
   * this surface is asking; it is the same helper the record body's
   * double-click/pencil affordances read, so a list and a record page cannot
   * disagree about whether an object's rows are editable in place.
   *
   * `can()` answers `true` with no `PermissionProvider`, so standalone embeds
   * and the Studio designer keep today's behavior — the same fail-open the
   * bulk gate above relies on.
   *
   * ## Gap 2 — consuming the declared `userActions.editInline`
   *
   * `ListViewSchema.userActions.editInline` is spec-declared and, on this
   * toolbar, was read by nothing: an author could not switch inline editing off
   * even unconditionally. It is read here as an explicit opt-OUT (`!== false`).
   *
   * That default is deliberate and it does NOT enforce the spec's
   * `.default(false)`. Enforcing it would take the toggle away from every
   * existing console list view in one release, since nothing folds a legacy key
   * into `editInline` and no stored view declares it — the console's own
   * channel for this capability is the view's `inlineEdit` property, which the
   * host relays as `onInlineEditChange`. This is `toolbarFlags`' stated rule
   * for exactly this block (defaults "matching what these flags have always
   * done"; `hideFields`/`rowColor` keep their historical OFF because flipping
   * them "would grow two buttons on every existing view") applied in the
   * direction that would REMOVE one. So: an explicit `false` is honoured, an
   * explicit `true` is honoured, and absence defers to the host channel that
   * already governs this surface. `InterfaceListPage` — the other consumer of
   * this key — reads the absent case as OFF (`=== true`), because the
   * ADR-0047 interface page has no such host channel to defer to.

    // reference-bearing fields, so every name judged here is declared and the
    // "`checkField` answers false for an undeclared key" trap is unreachable.

  // destructures `({ schema })` and hands `ObjectGantt` exactly `schema` and
  // `dataSource`, so `data`, `onRowClick`, `rowHeight` and the rest of
  // `baseProps` are dropped one layer up, and the chart queries for itself

  // behaviourally, one package over, in
  // `plugin-gantt/src/ObjectGantt.hostDataProp-7210.test.tsx`.
  //
  // The withholding is kept anyway: it is unreachable, not wrong, and it stops
  // being unreachable the moment that wrapper forwards host props — whether a
  // non-grid view may fetch unbounded at all is an open maintainer decision
  // (objectui#7210, half 2). `ObjectGantt.reload` takes its `rest.data`
  // short-circuit on `data && Array.isArray(data)`, and `[]` satisfies both,
  // while this view's rows array is never filled (the fetch effect below
  // returns early for it). Forwarding it would therefore replace the endpoint's

  /**
   * Does the surface rendered below draw the rows THIS component fetched?
   *
   * objectui#7210. The record-count bar at the foot of this component reports
   * this component's own paged query — `data.length` (or `serverTotal`), the
   * `dataLimitReached` warning that goes with `$top: effectivePageSize`, and a
   * rows-per-page selector that re-issues it. It is the only paging disclosure
   * on the screen, so a reader takes it as describing whatever is drawn above
   * it.
   *
   * On `gantt` that reading is false, and the bar is then worse than no bar.
   * MEASURED rather than inferred: the registered `object-gantt` renderer
   * (`plugin-gantt/src/index.tsx`) resolves to
   * `< ObjectGantt schema={bound} dataSource={dataSource} / >` and forwards no
   * other prop — unlike `object-grid` / `object-kanban` / `object-calendar` /
   * `object-map` / `object-tree`, whose wrappers all spread `{...props}`. The
   * `data` handed to the SchemaRenderer below therefore never reaches the
   * chart, `ObjectGantt.reload` issues its OWN query, and that query carries no
   * `$top` at all. Harness: 18 rows, `pagination.pageSize: 6` — the chart drew
   * 18 rows while this bar read "6 records · Showing first 6 records. More data
   * may be available." The same harness on `grid` ("18 records", the server
   * total, no warning) and on `kanban` ("6 records …", and the board really is
   * drawing those 6) is why this is scoped to `gantt` alone: everywhere else
   * the bar is telling the truth and must keep telling it.
   *
   * ⛔ The correction is NOT to forward `data` to the chart. That would cap a
   * gantt at one page, turning a complete schedule into a quietly truncated one
   * that still looks like a schedule. Whether a non-grid view may fetch
   * unbounded is an open maintainer decision (objectui#7210, half 2) — this
   * line is correct whichever way that lands, which is why it did not wait for
   * it.
   *
   * ⛔ Nor does suppressing the bar make this component's query dead: `data`
   * still gates the loading skeleton and the load-error panel (so it decides
   * whether the chart mounts at all), feeds `UserFilters`' option counts, and
   * is what the client-side CSV/JSON export writes out. Measured with the paged
   * response delayed: while it was in flight the skeleton was up and the chart
   * had 0 rows, though its own unbounded response had already arrived.

  /**
   * Did the AUTHOR declare a column projection at all? (objectui#6598)
   *
   * `effectiveFields` is `[]` in two situations the child grid cannot tell
   * apart, and sending the same empty array for both is what produced this
   * issue's headline symptom: `<list-view objectName="opportunity" />` on an
   * html-kind page rendered the row count, the toolbar and the index column —
   * and not one data column, with no diagnostic anywhere.
   *
   *   1. The author declared none (`columns` absent, or `[]`). `ObjectGrid`
   *      derives defaults from the object schema for exactly this case
   *      ("Default columns priority (when schema doesn't specify columns)"),
   *      and `normalizeColumns` already reads an empty `columns` as unauthored
   *      — the same rule `ElementDataSourceGate`'s precedence table states.
   *      But that derivation is gated on `schema.fields` being ABSENT, and an
   *      empty array is truthy, so the `fields: []` this component sent read as
   *      "show exactly these zero columns" and the defaults never ran.
   *      Single-variable measurement: a bare `<object-grid objectName="…" />`
   *      on the same tier, same data source, renders four default columns; the
   *      same object behind `<list-view>` renders none.
   *   2. The author declared some and the gates above removed them all — FLS
   *      denied every one, or every one is hidden. That case must KEEP sending
   *      the empty projection. Falling through to the grid's defaults there
   *      would show fields the author never asked for.
   *
   *      ⭐ THE REASON CHANGED; THE PREDICATE DID NOT (objectui#6799). This
   *      clause used to end "…and `ObjectGrid` re-applies FLS only on the
   *      DERIVED path, not on the explicit-columns one — so widening here would
   *      be a widening past the field gate." That is no longer true. As of
   *      objectui#6799 the grid re-applies FLS on ALL THREE of its default
   *      paths, the authored `columns` one included, so a fall-through here no
   *      longer escapes the field gate. The predicate stays exactly as it is
   *      for the half of the sentence that never depended on the grid: an empty
   *      projection is the AUTHOR's projection after filtering, and handing the
   *      grid "unauthored" would replace it with the object's default columns —
   *      fields the author never declared. FLS-checked now, but still not what
   *      was authored. AUTHORING INTENT is what this predicate protects, and
   *      that was always the load-bearing half.
   *
   * Hence the question is about the AUTHORED value and never about what
   * survived filtering.

  // sort on a field this picker then refused to list — the declared sort
  // worked on load, while its rows rendered blank and the user could neither
  // reproduce nor modify it. The whitelist is a FILTER contract; sortability
  // is a separate question, answered by the two rules below.
  //

  // This view's sort becomes a server `$orderby` on the FLAT field name, and a
  // relational field stores a foreign-key id — so "sort by Owner" orders the
  // whole collection by `rec_7f3…` while the column shows names. It reads as
  // "sorting is broken", with nothing saying the key is something else. The
  // server cannot sort by the related record's name without a join
  // (objectstack#4256 settled that it won't), so the honest move is to stop
  // offering the illusion: relational fields leave the picker, and the hint
  // below points at the supported alternative (a stored field that
  // denormalizes the name onto this object, written when the source changes).
  //
  // Second rule — THE PLATFORM SAYS which field names it will order by
  // (objectstack#10235 ruling A, consumed here via #5729's landed spelling in
  // `@object-ui/core`). `isPlatformSortableField` is the contract: an entry
  // must EXIST in the served projection and say `sortable: true`. Absence is a
  // refusal — an unknown name, a dotted path, an unprovisioned audit column —
  // never a default of `true`. Withheld silently, so the relational hint below
  // stays strictly about relations, which is what its sentence describes.
  //
  // This picker used to re-derive that verdict from the field's TYPE, reading
  // `UNMATERIALIZED_FIELD_TYPES` (#3950 consolidated the local copy into core).
  // The two agree about `formula` — the platform computes its own projection
  // from the same `@objectstack/spec` storage fact — which is exactly why the
  // drift went unnoticed: they part company on everything the projection
  // encodes as ABSENCE, and on any verdict the runtime doors add later, where
  // a type read answers `sortable` and the platform answers `400 INVALID_SORT`.
  // One judgement, served; not a fourth copy of it drifting apart.
  //
  // NO SIGNAL SERVED (`undefined`) is a different question from "nothing is
  // sortable": a deployment older than objectstack#10235, an inline/mock data
  // source, or `objectDef` not yet loaded. That branch keeps the type read as a
  // compatibility floor — behaviour identical to before this card — and is
  // meant to be deleted when the supported floor passes that release.
  //
  // Exception (both rules): a field the CURRENT sort already uses stays listed
  // — relational ones flagged as ordering by ID — so opening this popover on a
  // view that was authored (or saved before this change) with such a sort
  // neither renders a blank row nor silently drops that sort on the next edit.
  // For a platform-refused field that exception is the only way to REMOVE the
  // offending row, since the sort it names is one the server refuses outright.
  //
  // ONE read of the served projection, for BOTH legs below — the list this
  // picker renders, and the sort it emits for a host to persist. Read twice,
  // the two copies could answer differently about the same field on the same
