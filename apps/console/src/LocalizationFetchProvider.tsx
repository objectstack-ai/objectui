/**
 * LocalizationFetchProvider — loads the caller's resolved regional defaults
 * (currency / locale) from `GET /api/v1/auth/me/localization` (ADR-0053) and
 * feeds the pure `LocalizationProvider` so every field / measure renderer can
 * resolve a currency code down to the org default.
 *
 * Cosmetic, NOT fail-closed: while loading or on error it renders children with
 * an empty value (no tenant default → renderers show a plain number), so a slow
 * or missing endpoint never blocks the app.
 *
 * That posture is why it retries QUIETLY. On a multi-tenant host this endpoint
 * is served by the environment kernel that owns the session, and a cold one
 * answers `503` + `Retry-After` while it warms (objectstack#4159) — so a
 * transient failure is a normal part of a cold start, not an exception. A single
 * attempt meant one 503 during warm-up degraded currency and locale for the
 * WHOLE session, silently and permanently, long after the kernel was ready.
 *
 * It also refreshes the UI-language seed cache from the same answer
 * (objectui#4035) — see the write inside the success branch. That is a cache
 * write only: it never changes this boot's language, and it leaves the fetch's
 * cosmetic / never-fail-closed / retried-in-the-background contract untouched.
 *
 * It shares the "is this transient / how long to wait" primitives with
 * `MePermissionsProvider` but not its policy: that one is fail-closed and holds
 * its loading state across the waits, this one keeps rendering throughout and
 * simply fills the value in if and when an attempt succeeds.
