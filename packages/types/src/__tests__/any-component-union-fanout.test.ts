/**
 * `AnyComponentSchema` discriminates on `type` (objectui#8498).
 *
 * ## The defect these pin
 *
 * As a flat `z.union`, a refusal reported EVERY arm's issues under one
 * `invalid_union`, and Zod's `$ZodError` initializer `JSON.stringify`s that
 * whole tree into `.message` EAGERLY — `zod/v4/core/errors.js:13`, in the
 * constructor, not behind a getter. So the cost was paid whether or not anyone
 * read the message, and it compounded per level of nesting until `safeParse`
 * itself threw `RangeError: Invalid string length` — out of `safeValidateSchema`,
 * which `index.zod.ts` documents as validating "without throwing errors".
 *
 * ⚠️ Every bound below is written to FAIL on the flat union, and each one was
 * run against it to check that it does. The readings, same documents, same zod
 * 4.4.3, flat -> discriminated:
 *
 *     known-type leaf refusal    14,624 -> 164 chars   (13 arm subtrees -> none)
 *     unknown `type` refusal     14,855 -> 2,178 chars
 *     refused node 4 deep        19,311 -> 4,330 chars
 *
 * A bound that also passed on the flat union would assert nothing, which is the
 * failure mode this card was most exposed to. ⚠️ The reason it was exposed has
 * since changed and this paragraph is corrected in place rather than deleted:
 * when this file was written `AnyComponentSchema` did not recurse into child
 * slots, so a nested document was simply ACCEPTED and a naive "does not throw at
 * depth 4" test was green for the wrong reason — which is why the depth case
 * below is built on `MenuItemSchema`, one of the few schemas that ALREADY refused
 * at depth on that tree. objectui#8344 has since redirected the node recursion
 * point, so a nested off-spec node IS refused now and the `MenuItemSchema` choice
 * is no longer load-bearing. ⛔ It stays anyway: it is the case this card measured
 * and re-pointing it would retire the measurement without replacing it. The
 * redirected path gets its own depth pin in
 * `node-recursion-point-8344.test.ts`, where the linear-growth reading lives.
