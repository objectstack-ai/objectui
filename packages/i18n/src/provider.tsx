 * full BCP-47 tag — the platform answers `zh-CN`, not `zh` (see
 * `LocalizationFetchProvider`'s fixtures) — while the packs are keyed by base
 * language. Asking only about `zh-CN` would reject the single most common
 * tenant configuration there is. The exact tag is tried first so a genuine
 * `pt-BR` pack still wins over `pt`; this mirrors `createI18n`'s own browser
 * detection (`navigator.language.split('-')[0]`) and `pickLocalized`'s
 * documented exact-then-base order, so it is this codebase's existing
 * convention rather than a new rule.
 *
 * **2. The seed does NOT get the dynamic loader's credit** (`hasLoader` is left
 * at its default `false`). That credit exists for a *user-picked* value: the
 * user chose it from a menu built out of the app's real locale list, and a
 * stored choice that turns out unshippable is adjudicated afterwards by the
 * `provisional` self-heal. A tenant seed has neither property — it is an
 * arbitrary admin-authored string that passed through no menu, and there is no
 * self-heal behind it. Extending the credit would mean booting into a locale we
 * cannot confirm we ship and then retracting it, i.e. manufacturing exactly the
 * flash that ruling point 3 bounds, on the very first-visit path it bounds it
 * on. Falling through instead is what ruling point 4 asks for, and it is
 * self-correcting in one step: the user switches once, and that switch is a

 * ⇒ any host that owns an await before `createRoot().render()` should spend it
 * here; `apps/console/src/main.tsx` does, alongside the runtime-config and auth
 * preflight round-trips it already waits on. A host that has no such seam gets
 * the documented `en`-while-loading behaviour instead, which is why this is a
