/**
 * Retirement pin — `TimelineSchema`'s `events`, `orientation` and `position`
 * are REFUSED by name, not silently kept (objectui#6170, ADR-0049 stage 2).
 *
 * ## The failure this pin exists to prevent
 *
 * Until objectui#6170 these three were the ONLY keys `TimelineSchema` declared,
 * and no renderer ever read any of them: a timeline authored with `events`
 * drew an EMPTY rail, `orientation: 'horizontal'` drew the default vertical
 * rail (the layout key is `variant`), and `position` did nothing at all. Every
 * one of those documents type-checked and parsed green, and nothing said a
 * word. The maintainer ruling (2026-08-25, 「同意」) sends the three down the
 * ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove route; with no producer that expects them to
 * render, the route is REMOVE.
 *
 * So the deliverable is not "the keys are gone". It is: **a document that
 * still carries one of them is refused loudly at the authoring boundary, and
 * the refusal says what to write instead.**
 *
 * ## Why tombstones, and not simply deleting the members
 *
 * `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()` on the Zod side and carries a
 * `[key: string]: any` index signature on the TS side (objectui#5155 /
 * objectui#6269 own that ceiling). An UNDECLARED key is therefore accepted,
 * unvalidated, by both halves — deleting the members would hand the retired
 * keys exactly the silent no-op this pin exists to prevent. `?: never` /
 * `retirementTombstone()` on both halves, in lockstep, is this package's
 * convention (`timeline-timescale-retired.test.ts` pins the same shape for
 * `timeScale`, objectui#6355).
 *
 * ## What each assertion measures
 *
 * The refusal is asserted by ENVELOPE — the issue's path names the key, its
 * `code` is `invalid_type`, it `expected` `never` — never by `success: false`
 * alone, which an unrelated rejection would satisfy. Each refusal is paired
 * with a counter-probe (the same document, migrated) that must parse green, so
 * a schema that refused everything could not pass for this one. The old
 * vocabularies' WELL-TYPED values are the probes on purpose: before this
 * change `orientation: 'horizontal'` and `position: 'left'` parsed green, so
 * these assertions are red on the pre-retirement tree for the retirement's
 * reason, not for a bad value's.
