/**
 * objectui#6875 — the gate that DERIVES `ObjectGrid`'s relational copy set from
 * its consumers instead of trusting a hand-kept literal.
 * objectui#7187 — scoped that derivation to the consumer the bag actually
 * reaches, which is what makes it able to judge a COPY.
 *
 * ## What went wrong, and why a longer literal would not have fixed it
 *
 * `RELATIONAL_META_KEYS` was governed by a rule stated only in prose — *every
 * key here has to have a measured reader on this grid's own render path*. The
 * repo enforced that rule in one direction: objectui#6711 and objectui#6874
 * each removed a key that had NO reader, and each left a behavioural pin
 * behind. Nothing enforced the other direction, so five keys that DO have
 * readers on this path were never copied, and the list's own spellings had gone
 * inconsistent — `lookupFilters` (camel) sat in it while `displayField` and
 * `descriptionField` did not, though all three come off the same kind of
 * chain in the same files.
 *
 * Adding the missing spellings by hand would restore the invariant for exactly
 * as long as nobody touches a consumer. This file is the invariant itself: it
 * re-extracts the read set from the consumer sources on every run and requires
 * `RELATIONAL_META_READ_SET` to match it EXACTLY, in both directions. A new
 * spelling in any chain is unclassified → red. A key deleted from a chain is an
 * orphan in the table → red.
 *
 * ## ⛔ THE DEFECT objectui#7187 FIXED — a union cannot judge a copy
 *
 * Until objectui#7187 the extraction was collapsed into ONE set, the UNION over
 * three consumers, and a copy-set entry was licensed by membership in it. Only
 * the FIRST consumer is fed the copied bag. So membership meant "some consumer
 * reads this key" and never "this bag is how that consumer gets it" — and a
 * copy-set entry asserts the second. objectui#6875 read the first as the second
 * and shipped `descriptionField` and `lookupColumns` onto a bag their only
 * reader never consults; objectui#7166 measured that and retired three keys,
 * and this gate stayed green through both the wrong verdict and its undoing.
 *
 * ⇒ The union is gone. The reader axis is recorded PER CONSUMER on each entry
 * (`readers`), checked against that consumer's own source in both directions,
 * and the copy set is derived from `CONSUMERS_FED_THIS_BAG` alone. The three
 * retired keys can no longer be re-added under ANY verdict:
 *
 *   - as `spec` — the cell does not read them, so the
 *     derived copy set does not contain them and the copy-set assertion is red;
 *   - under the `copiedWithoutCellReader` exit — objectui#7155 retired the
 *     `legacy-alias` class that exit existed for, and the gate now asserts NO
 *     entry takes it at all.
 *
 * ## The three consumers, and how each is read
 *
 * `generateColumns()` hands `fieldMeta` to `CellRenderer` as the `field` prop.
 * `getCellRenderer` dispatches a relational column to `LookupCellRenderer`
 * (`@object-ui/fields/src/index.tsx`), which reads its keys through
 * `(field as { k?: T }).k` casts — the untyped-read shape this seam uses. The
 * inline editor renders `LookupField` (receiver `fieldMeta`) and `UserField`
 * (receiver `meta`), which use optional-chained member reads.
 *
 * ⚠️ Those two are swept, and they are NOT fed this bag — `renderCellEditor`
 * spreads the schema def into them directly (objectui#7154, measured in
 * `lookupPickerKeys-7154.test.tsx`). objectui#7187 stopped taking that on
 * trust: `CONSUMERS_FED_THIS_BAG` is checked against `ObjectGrid.tsx`'s own
 * `renderCellEditor`, which must spread the schema def and must never name
 * `fieldMeta`.
 *
 * ⚠️ `UserField` is swept even though it forwards its whole meta into
 * `LookupField` via a spread. A delegating consumer is exactly where a false
 * zero hides: a key it read and did NOT forward would be invisible in
 * `LookupField`'s own source. Its extracted set being a subset is a RESULT
 * here, not an assumption — and under the split it is asserted as one, since
 * dropping `UserField` because "it forwards anyway" is precisely the assumption
 * that would hide such a key.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The extractor is bounded, and says so
 *
 * It reads member accesses off named receivers — the receiver itself and every
 * ANNOTATED ALIAS of it, `const NAME: TYPE = receiver;`, which is the same
 * object read through a declared type (objectui#6153 introduced the first one:
 * `LookupField`'s `cascadeMeta`, the `LookupFieldMetadata` view of `fieldMeta`
 * through which `dependsOn` is read; a consumer that
 * de-casts a read this way has not stopped reading, and a scanner that could
 * not see it would have reported two real reads as orphans). Aliases are
 * derived from the consumer's own source on every run, never listed here. A key
 * that reaches a consumer some other way — destructuring, a computed
 * `meta[expr]`, a helper that takes the whole bag — is outside its reach. That
 * is the honest limit; the five spellings objectui#6875 measured were all plain
 * member reads, and so is every key the three chains use today.
 * `assertExtractorFoundKnownChains` is the positive control that keeps a
 * silently-empty extraction from reading as a clean bill of health, and the
 * alias CONTROL below keeps the alias rule from reaching further than it says.
