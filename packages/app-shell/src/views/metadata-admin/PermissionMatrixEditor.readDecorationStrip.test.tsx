/**
 * The permission door's package save carries no read decorations
 * (objectui#8181).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists after the strip already landed
 *
 * objectui#8181 asked for a read-decoration strip at three consumers. All
 * three have one on `main`. Two of them — `ObjectHooksPanel` and
 * `StudioDesignSurface` — delegate to the hoisted `extractDraftBody` in
 * `@object-ui/data-objectstack`, so deleting their strip is caught by
 * `draft-envelope.test.ts`. THIS consumer is the exception: it does not call
 * the hoisted reader, it calls `stripReadDecorations` inline at its own unwrap.
 *
 * Measured before this file was written: removing that inline strip — leaving
 * the unwrap, i.e. restoring the exact `((pendingDraft as any).item ??
 * pendingDraft)` shape the card names — turned NOTHING red across
 * `PermissionMatrixEditor.*` and both `data-objectstack` draft suites. A lit
 * control run at the same line (dropping the pending draft entirely) DID turn
 * one test red, so the path is exercised; it was the decorations specifically
 * that nothing asserted. That is what this file closes: the strip was present
 * and unguarded, one edit away from silently coming back.
 *
 * ## Why the `.catch` arm and not the everyday one
 *
 * ⚠️ The success arm cannot carry decorations and is not evidence either way.
 * `doSave` re-reads `layered` and merges through `mergePermissionSlice`, which
 * starts from `{ ...base }` and copies only `EDITOR_AUTHORED_KEYS` out of the
 * edited draft — so when the fresh read succeeds, `base` is the RAW `effective`
 * layer and every decoration is dropped by the merge whether or not the unwrap
 * stripped. A pin written there would pass with the strip deleted.
 *
 * The leak the card names is the other arm: `client.layered(...).catch(() =>
 * null)` falls back to `base = payload`, the draft body itself, and
 * `mergePermissionSlice` then spreads it wholesale into `client.save`. The card
 * called this out as "a failure-path-only leak and it has not been exercised".
 * It is exercised here.
 *
 * ## What the far side does, stated so nobody re-derives it
 *
 * The server does not 400 on this today: `saveMetaItem` strips read decorations
 * on ingress, ahead of its schema gate. That is a mitigation in the framework,
 * not a licence for this client to PUT a body its own spec rejects —
 * `PermissionSetSchema.safeParse(body + _diagnostics)` answers
 * `unrecognized_keys` at the root. AGENTS.md #0.1: fix it at the producer.
