/**
 * markdown-fence-scan -- the ONE answer to "does this line OPEN a fenced code
 * block, and what is allowed to close it?" (objectui#9194)
 *
 *   node scripts/markdown-fence-scan.mjs --self-test
 *
 * ## The defect this module exists to make unrepresentable
 *
 * Two doc gates -- `check-doc-component-types.mjs` and
 * `check-doc-expression-carriage.mjs` -- each carried this predicate, verbatim:
 *
 *     const fence = /^\s*```(\S*)\s*$/.exec(line);
 *
 * `(\S*)` is greedy over non-space, so a FOUR-backtick opener matched as a
 * three-backtick opener whose *language* was the leftover backtick plus the real
 * language. Three things then went wrong at once, on a page that is legitimately
 * teaching nested fences (`content/docs/plugins/plugin-markdown.mdx`):
 *
 *   1. a language that does not exist -- a backtick-bearing string -- got its
 *      own column in the per-language census;
 *   2. two PHANTOM fences with empty bodies, both reporting a successful parse,
 *      because the object-BODY retry wraps `''` into `{}` and `{}` parses. An
 *      empty non-fence was therefore counted as a successfully parsed fence in
 *      the coverage figures;
 *   3. the nesting INVERTED -- the four-backtick line opened, the real inner
 *      opener CLOSED, and the code between them sat outside any fence and was
 *      invisible to both gates while the parse rate still read healthy.
 *
 * The bounded instance was two markers in one file. The hazard is the SHAPE: an
 * ODD number of stray markers desynchronises fence pairing for the rest of the
 * file, so both gates judge the wrong bodies and report a clean coverage figure
 * over a region the instrument mis-read (the objectui#8334 family).
 *
 * ## The rule, which is CommonMark's and not this repo's invention
 *
 * A fenced code block opens on a RUN of at least three backticks or at least
 * three tildes, and closes only on a run of the SAME character that is AT LEAST
 * AS LONG, carrying no info string. That is what makes a shorter run inside a
 * longer one ordinary body text, which is precisely how a page teaches nested
 * fences. The info string of a BACKTICK fence may not contain a backtick --
 * which is what structurally prevents a language capture from ever holding one
 * again, rather than detecting it after the fact.
 *
 * ## Two deliberate divergences from strict CommonMark, both measured
 *
 *   - **Indentation is not capped at three spaces.** CommonMark says a marker
 *     indented four or more spaces is indented code, not a fence. The replaced
 *     predicates accepted any leading whitespace, and tightening that here would
 *     silently DROP fences the gates read today -- a behaviour change this card
 *     did not ask for. Measured over every tracked `.md`/`.mdx` file in the tree
 *     at the time of writing: 12 marker lines are indented past three spaces and
 *     every one of them is in `.github/prompts/component.prompt.md`, which is on
 *     neither gate's scan surface. Tightening is a separate card.
 *   - **Blank-info and multi-token info are both accepted as openers.** The
 *     replaced predicates required the whole info string to be one non-space
 *     token (`\s*$` after the capture), so a ```` ```ts title="a.ts" ```` line
 *     was not a fence at all and its body was read as prose. Accepting it is
 *     CommonMark and is behaviour-neutral on today's corpus: the same sweep
 *     found ZERO marker lines with a multi-token info string, and zero tilde
 *     fences.
 *
 * ## Why this is a MODULE and not two patched copies
 *
 * The two gates already share a module boundary -- one imports the other's doc
 * surface constants -- so there was no extraction cost to weigh, and "N
 * separately-correct copies" is the family this tree keeps paying for
 * (objectstack#17681, the objectui#7448 family). A copy that is separately
 * correct today is a copy that drifts silently tomorrow: the card's own closing
 * sentence is that a fix applied to one gate can leave the other behind.
 * `scripts/__tests__/markdown-fence-scan.test.ts` is the recurrence guard -- it
 * fails if either gate grows a private fence predicate again.
 *
 * Prior art, deliberately named rather than re-derived: `body-dialect-census.mjs`
 * (`keepFencedCodeOnly`) and `check-doc-fence-languages.mjs` were already
 * run-aware and already carried the "closes on a run at least as long" comment.
 * They are offset-based and self-contained respectively; this module is the
 * line-based spelling the two doc gates need, and it is the one a third gate
 * should import instead of writing a fourth.
