/**
 * The TRUE-identity fold counts only the keys the loop PROCESSED — objectui#9030.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `convertFiltersToAST` folds a filter that is nothing but TRUE-identity
 * combinators to `undefined` (objectui#8770), and folds a filter whose every key
 * the loop SKIPPED for a `null` / `undefined` value to `undefined` too
 * (objectui#9020). Each fold was keyed on its own count compared with
 * `Object.keys(filter).length`.
 *
 * But the loop's first statement skips the null/undefined keys without
 * incrementing anything the identity fold counts, while that denominator counted
 * them anyway. So a filter carrying one identity group beside one skipped key
 * read `1 === 2`, the fold declined, and the CALLER'S ORIGINAL OBJECT came back:
 *
 * ```
 * { $and: [] }                =>  undefined            folds
 * { b: undefined }            =>  undefined            folds
 * { $and: [], b: undefined }  =>  { $and: [], … }      did NOT fold
 * ```
 *
 * ⭐ Each key folds ALONE and the two together did not — behaviour decided by a
 * sibling, the hazard objectui#8555 named on this same function. Read the other
 * way round: adding an always-TRUE `$and: []` to a filter that folded could stop
 * it folding.
 *
 * ## Why BOTH skipped classes come along, and why that is not a new ruling
 *
 * The loop skips `null` and `undefined` with ONE statement, and objectui#9020
 * already ruled what that skip means when it is all that is left: the key
 * contributes no condition, so the filter constrains nothing and says so. That
 * ruling is what this card carries into the mixed case; it does not re-decide
 * it, and it does not touch the skip — `{ a: null, s: 1 }` still lowers to
 * `['s', '=', 1]`, pinned in the controls below.
 *
 * ⚠️ The card that filed this proposed admitting `undefined` while keeping
 * `null` out, on the reasoning that a null-valued key rides the `$expand` route
 * as a real `a IS NULL` predicate. That reasoning was measured before
 * objectui#9020 landed and no longer holds: `{ a: null }` no longer reaches
 * either route as a predicate. Keeping `null` out would ALSO have meant reading
 * the two spellings apart for the first time anywhere in this file, and would
 * have left `{ $and: [], a: null }` as the one member of the family that still
 * 400s on the plain route — the very defect objectui#8770 exists to end. The
 * two-route measurement is in
 * `filter-identity-skipped-mix-two-routes-9030.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why the assertions are shaped the way they are
 *
 * Two halves, the shape taken from objectui#8770's own file, because either
 * alone passes on something worse than the bug:
 *
 *   - a SHAPE assertion (`toBeUndefined`) alone passes on a converter that has
 *     stopped emitting anything at all;
 *   - a ROW-SET assertion alone cannot tell "honoured" from "dropped" — a filter
 *     whose ruled answer is every row and an absent filter select the same rows.
 *
 * So §0 proves the fixture distinguishes every-row from a real subset before any
 * of it is read that way, the shape half is asserted against the spec's own door
 * (`isFilterAST`) rather than a literal, and the FALSE identity `{ $or: [] }` is
 * carried as a control that must keep selecting NO rows.
