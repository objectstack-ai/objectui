   * ladder is `bundle key -> field.label -> field.name`, and an enumerated
   * `sections[].fields` list is `['our_entity', ...]`: bare strings, which

   * field name`. With no bundle — the default for an app that has not
   * configured translations — EVERY detail page rendered raw snake_case field
   * names under a `text-transform: uppercase`, while `clm_contract.our_entity`
   * declared `label: 'Our Signing Entity'` all along and nothing reported it.
   *
   * The label is NOT invented here and it is not a new source: this is the
   * same read the GROUP-derived body already performed (`toField` in
   * `synth/buildDefaultPageSchema.ts`: `label: f.label || name`), which is
   * exactly why the platform's synthesized default page showed declared labels
   * while a hand-authored enumeration of the same fields did not. Filling the
   * rung here is what makes the two bodies agree.
   *
   * ⚠️ An AUTHORED `label` on the entry still wins — `withDeclaredLabel` only
   * fills a `label` the author left undefined, so a view's explicit override
   * keeps its precedence, and an app WITH a full bundle is untouched because
   * rung 1 resolves before this value is ever read.
   *
   * `pickLocalized` rather than a raw read: a field label may be authored as an
   * inline `{ en, 'zh-CN' }` map, and handing that object through would render
   * `[object Object]`. It returns '' for a value it cannot resolve, which the
   * emptiness check below rejects so the ladder falls through to the name.

  // when the field exists in the data and the dedup wouldn't empty the

  //
  // ⚠️ This ladder is a DEDUPE, not a title resolver: the question it answers
  // is "which ROW disappears", and it is keyed on the record value being
  // non-empty because a row with no value is not duplicating a heading.
  // The H1 itself is drawn a package away, by `@object-ui/components`'
  // `PageHeaderRenderer` (`page:header`, synthesized by
  // `buildDefaultPageSchema`) — the names below mirror THAT chain, which is
  // why a change to either half must re-read the other.
  //
  // ⭐ The first two candidates are the unified ADR-0079 resolver, in NAME
  // space (objectui#8175). Before them this list was the six literal names
  // alone — the TAIL of the header's chain with no equivalent of the resolver

  // (`name`, the literal walk's first entry, a row the H1 never showed).
  // Pinned in `__tests__/record-details.nameFieldDedupe-8175.test.tsx`, which
  // asserts which row RENDERS and which row DROPS — never the heading, which
  // this package does not draw.
  //
  // ⚠️ The resolver rung is UNROLLED into two candidates on purpose, and
  // `resolveNameField` alone is NOT enough. It returns ONE answer and
  // short-circuits: a declared pointer wins outright and `deriveTitleField`
  // never runs. This ladder is VALUE-keyed, and so is the header's — when the
  // declared pointer is blank on a record, `getRecordDisplayName` keeps
  // walking and lands on the derivation (step 4). Listing both rungs is what
  // lets the fall-through happen here too. When nothing is declared the two
  // return the same name and the first one simply wins.
  //
  // ⚠️ Two disagreements with the header chain are KNOWN and deliberately NOT
  // repaired here — both are rungs that name no FIELD, so there is no row to
  // hide for either, and closing them is a separate ruling:
  //   - `page:header`'s own `schema.title`, which this package cannot see;
  //   - `objectSchema.titleFormat`, a render-only template the header ranks
  //     ABOVE the declared pointer (pinned in `@object-ui/components`'
  //     `__tests__/page-header-title.test.tsx`, "titleFormat still outranks
  //     nameField"), interpolating any number of fields.
  //
  // ⛔ `objSchema?.primaryField` used to top this list, and it is gone
  // (objectui#7586). It is a `DetailViewSchema` key (`@object-ui/types`
  // `views.ts`) — a VIEW key, read here off an OBJECT def, where nothing can
  // declare it: `@objectstack/spec`'s object schema is a `strictObject`
  // answering `unrecognized_keys: ['primaryField']`, and
  // `ObjectSchema.create()` throws. objectstack#6326 removed the identical
  // read from two lint rules; objectui#7287 / PR #7585 removed it from
  // `resolveTitleField`, and the same removal from the header chain above is
  // what keeps the two halves agreeing. `DetailView.resolveDisplayTitle`
  // still reads `schema.primaryField` off the VIEW schema and is welcome to.
  //
  // ⚠️ The docstring here used to name `objectSchema.primaryField` as the
  // chip's first source. That stopped being true when PR #7585 landed, and
  // this ladder outlived the sentence describing it — hence the rewrite
  // above rather than a one-line deletion. Pinned in
