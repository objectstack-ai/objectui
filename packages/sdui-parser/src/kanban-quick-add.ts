/**
 * ObjectUI — the inert `quickAdd` on the `ObjectKanbanRenderer` tag
 * (objectui#8285, director-seat ruling of 2026-09-08, decision batch #91)
 *
 * ## What is wrong, measured rather than argued
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s `ComponentPropsMap['object-kanban']` publishes
 * `quickAdd: z.boolean().optional()`, and the board does not honour it.
 * `KanbanImpl` gates the Quick Add control on BOTH halves of a pair —
 * `quickAdd && onQuickAdd`, at the in-column button and again at
 * `QuickAddForm` — and `onQuickAdd` is an objectui#6124 RUNTIME SLOT: a
 * host-supplied FUNCTION, refused by name in `complex.zod.ts` because JSON has
 * no function value. `ObjectKanban` substitutes its own `onCardMove` and
 * `onCardClick` and stops there; it supplies no `onQuickAdd` (measured on this
 * change's merge-base: zero occurrences of `onQuickAdd` in
 * `packages/plugin-kanban/src/ObjectKanban.tsx`, against six for `onCardClick`
 * in the same file, so the zero is a reading and not a broken pattern).
 *
 * On THIS tier the second half is not merely absent, it is unwritable: a
 * handler attribute on a parsed page draws `forbidden-attr` (measured), because
 * this tier parses and never executes. So `quickAdd` on these two tags is inert
 * for every author who can reach it here — there is no out-of-band consumer to
 * protect, which is the fact that makes the diagnostic below unconditional
 * rather than escape-hatched the way `unconsumed-widget-option` is.
 *
 * ## What this replaces, and why the previous reading was WRONG rather than absent
 *
 * ⚠️ The card was filed saying the key is dropped "with no diagnostic". That is
 * true of the SPEC validator, which accepts it, and FALSE of this tier as of
 * this change's merge-base: `quickAdd` is deliberately absent from
 * `OBJECT_KANBAN_INPUTS` (objectui#8201 escalated it rather than declaring it),
 * so `validateTree` already reported it — as `unknown-prop`, "has no prop
 * quickAdd".
 *
 * That message is a MISDIAGNOSIS, and this repository has already measured what
 * that costs. objectui#8201's pin header records the same shape from the other
 * direction: the html tier telling an author that spellings which WORK are
 * unknown "trains authors (AI authors included) to delete working metadata".
 * Here the falsehood runs the other way and is worse for it — the spec DOES
 * publish this prop, so an author who checks the contract finds the warning
 * contradicted, concludes the manifest is behind the spec, and keeps a key that
 * will never do anything. It also cannot be told apart from a typo, so nothing
 * anywhere records WHY the key is refused.
 *
 * This module says the true thing instead: the pair, the missing half, and
 * where the pair does work.
 *
 * ## Severity — WARNING, and the escalation is deliberately not taken
 *
 * The ruling's word is "diagnosed", not "refused", and every diagnostic in this
 * family is a warning: `unknown-prop` (what this replaces, so nothing hardens),
 * `inert-expression`, and `unconsumed-widget-option`, whose objectui#5709
 * ruling states the constraint directly — "no gate weakening and no new red
 * gates were ruled". `validate.ts`'s `inert-expression` note records that
 * escalating an inert authored key to `error` is a SEPARATE question
 * (objectui#6614 Q2) belonging at the save gate, and it is not answered here:
 * an error would stop a page that saves today from saving, which is a cost, and
 * costs are the maintainer's to impose.
 *
 * The contract-side refusal is where the hardening belongs, and it is already
 * ruled: option B retires `object-kanban.quickAdd` from the spec's
 * `ComponentPropsMap` (ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove), after which a strict parse
 * refuses the key BY NAME and this module is deleted along with the interim it
 * names. ⚠️ THIS FILE IS THAT INTERIM. It is scheduled for removal by the same
 * change that lands the spec pin — see objectui#8285's Execution paragraph.
 *
 * ## Scope — the three places this deliberately does not fire
 *
 *   - `KanbanRenderer`, the component. The ruling keeps the `quickAdd` /
 *     `onQuickAdd` pair there untouched: it forwards both halves by identity,
 *     and a React host mounting it CAN pass the function. ⚠️ It is no longer
 *     reachable as a TAG — objectui#8257 retired the `kanban-ui` registration,
 *     so on this tier `<kanban-ui>` is now an `unknown-component` ERROR, not a
 *     block with a working pair. The component stays exported from
 *     `@object-ui/plugin-kanban`, which is the surviving way to get the pair,
 *     and is what this module's message names.
 *   - `quickAdd: false`, and any other falsy value. The renderer's own gate is
 *     `quickAdd && onQuickAdd`, so a falsy value asks for no control and gets
 *     none — the author got what they wrote, and nothing was dropped. The
 *     ruling names `quickAdd: true`.
 *   - A braced value this tier never evaluates (the parser's `$expr` marker).
 *     It is opaque here, so "the author asked for the control" is not a reading
 *     this module can make; the value's own inertness is `inert-expression`'s
 *     subject, not this one's.

 * The tags served by `ObjectKanbanRenderer` — the registrations in
 * `packages/plugin-kanban/src/index.tsx`, which is where another one would
 * appear. Restated here as data because this package is deliberately free of
 * any dependency on the registry or on a plugin (see `RegistryConfigLike` in
 * `index.ts`), and re-derived from that file's registration calls by
 * `packages/plugin-kanban/src/__tests__/quickAddIsDiagnosedNotDropped-8285.test.ts`,
 * so a renamed or added tag reddens a named row rather than silently narrowing
 * this set.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`kanban` left this set with its registration** (objectui#8802, ruled
 * 2026-09-09; `kanban-ui` and `kanban-enhanced` went the same way under
 * objectui#8257). Keeping it would have been dead data, MEASURED and not
 * assumed: `checkKanbanQuickAdd` has exactly one call site, inside
 * `validate.ts`'s prop walk, and that walk runs only in the branch where
 * `manifest.components[node.type]` RESOLVED. A tag no registration produces is
 * answered one level up, by `unknown-component`, and its props are never walked
 * at all — so on a manifest built from the live registry a `<kanban quickAdd>`
 * node draws `error/unknown-component` and nothing else, against a firing
 * control on `<object-kanban quickAdd>` that draws `warning/inert-quick-add`.
 * ⛔ Nothing is silently dropped by the narrowing: the retired spelling is
 * refused BY NAME at the tag, which is a louder answer than this warning, and
 * stacking both would be the two-diagnostics-for-one-mistake shape
 * `checkMemberTypes` already refuses (objectui#8067). The one path that could
 * still reach a `kanban` entry is a HAND-BUILT manifest declaring a component
 * of that name — which, after the retirement, is somebody else's component, and
 * the message below asserts things about `ObjectKanban` that would be false of
 * it.
