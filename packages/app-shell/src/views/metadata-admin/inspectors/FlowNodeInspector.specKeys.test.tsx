/**
 * **FlowNodeInspector writes only keys `FlowNodeSchema` accepts** (objectui#6287).
 *
 * The inspector used to offer a "Description" text field that committed
 * `node.description`. `FlowNodeSchema` is `.strict()` (objectstack#4001) and
 * refuses that key BY NAME:
 *
 *     FlowNodeSchema.safeParse({ id, type, label, description, config })
 *       -> unrecognized_keys: ["description"]
 *
 * By this package's own established reading of that mechanism, the cost is not
 * untidiness — it is an unsavable draft: "the key surfaces as
 * `unrecognized_keys` in the live client validation and as a 422 on save"
 * (`flow-canvas-layout.withCanonicalGeometry`, on the identical `ui` case).
 * So the field did not merely describe a shape the contract refuses, it
 * PRODUCED one, on every keystroke.
 *
 * ## Why the obvious pins are ghosts, and what this file pins instead
 *
 * Dropping `description?` from a local `interface` proves nothing on its own,
 * for two independent reasons measured on this card:
 *
 * 1. The node the inspector edits is typed `InspectorFlowNode` (the exported shape
 *    `locateFlowNode` returns), NOT the inspector's own module-local
 *    declaration — so narrowing only the local copy changes no read.
 * 2. Both shapes carry a deliberately load-bearing `[k: string]: unknown`
 *    index signature (the canvas round-trips node properties it does not
 *    itself understand, and dropping them on save would be data loss). An
 *    index signature absorbs every excess property, so an object literal
 *    carrying `description` type-checks in BOTH worlds: a `@ts-expect-error`
 *    negative test does not go red before the fix, it goes red AFTER it, as an
 *    unused directive. Measured, not assumed.
 *
 * The two assertions below survive both traps:
 *
 * - **Compile time**: the DECLARED members of `InspectorFlowNode` — index signature
 *   stripped — must be a subset of the spec's own `FlowNode` keys. That closes
 *   the whole class rather than the one key: any future member added to the
 *   read type that the contract refuses turns this red.
 * - **Runtime**: what the inspector actually EMITS must parse clean through the
 *   real `FlowNodeSchema`, including for a stored node that already carries
 *   `description` — which heals on the author's first edit, exactly as the
 *   retired `ui` geometry does.
 *
 * Both are guarded against lying: the type assertions carry `IsAny` /
 * non-empty-key-set probes (a degenerate probe passes every assignability test
 * while proving nothing — objectstack#4171), and the runtime assertions carry a
 * positive control proving this really is the strict schema and that the
 * queries used to prove a control ABSENT can find controls that are present.
