/**
 * objectui#10035 — a write refreshes the list's DATA; it does not rebuild the
 * list (AGENTS.md #8's corollary).
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `renderListView` keyed `<ListView>` on `objectName-viewId-counter`, where the
 * counter is this page's refresh signal plus the plugin ObjectView's. The page
 * bumps it after every write it hears about — record actions, import, realtime
 * events, view edits, and the console's `externalRefreshKey` (record-form save,
 * undo, redo). So each write REMOUNTED the list: its toolbar, search, popovers,
 * selection and in-list visualization choice all went with it. The rows were
 * refetched too — a remounted `ListView` fetches on mount — which is why
 * nothing looked broken: the damage was the remount, not a missing refetch.
 *
 * ## The two halves, and which world each one can fail in
 *
 * The in-place cases assert BOTH:
 *   (a) the list is the SAME mounted tree after the write — a DOM node read
 *       inside `ListView` before the write is the node on the page after it
 *       (a key remount replaces every node), and
 *   (b) the list query was re-issued, exactly once.
 * Against the pre-fix source (a) is the red half; (b) stays green there,
 * because that world refetched as well — through the remount. (b) is the half
 * that goes red if the counter leaves the key without reaching `ListView`
 * another way (`refreshTrigger`), which is the regression a naive "remove the
 * key" fix would ship: the page's own counter used to reach the list through
 * the key alone.
 *
 * ## The lists that draw a self-fetching visualization
 *
 * A list that can draw `gantt` or `chart` — as its own type, or through the
 * author's visualization whitelist — used to keep the counter in its key,
 * because those renderers query for themselves and read no refresh input
 * (`REMOUNT_TO_REFRESH_VISUALIZATIONS`), and these cases asserted the fresh
 * tree. The renderers now refetch in place on the data-invalidation bus, so the
 * list keeps its tree and the gantt re-issues ITS OWN query, exactly once, when
 * the write is declared on the bus — by the console for its own writes (the
 * bridge, undo / redo), and by this page for the changes it learns of another
 * way (realtime, import, server actions: `refreshData`).
 *
 * Everything here renders for real — the page, `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView`
 * and `plugin-list`'s `ListView` — on the harness of
 * `ObjectView.hostRerenderRefetch-10046.test.tsx`. The gantt is a stand-in
 * registered as `object-gantt` (the `ObjectView.stableFilterIdentity-7237`
 * precedent: `app-shell` does not depend on `plugin-gantt`). It reads the REAL
 * bus hook and queries on it exactly as `ObjectGantt` now does —
 * `ObjectGantt.invalidationRefetch-10035.test.tsx` proves the real component
 * does that — and carries an instance id from a `useState` initializer, so a
 * remount of the visualization itself is visible too.
