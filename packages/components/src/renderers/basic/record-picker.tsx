 * element:record_picker — an interactive element that lets the user pick one
 * record of an object and writes the selection into a page variable.
 *
 * Data binding follows the spec's ElementDataSource (`schema.dataSource`):
 *   { object, view?, filter?, sort?, limit? }
 * with `properties.object` accepted as a fallback. Display config is read off
 * `schema.properties`:
 *   { labelField='name', valueField='id', label?, placeholder?, emptyText? }
 *
 * The selection is written through `usePageVariableBinding(schema.id)`: the
 * page variable whose `source` equals this picker's id receives the selected
 * record's `valueField` (default the record id). With no bound variable the
 * picker is uncontrolled (still usable, just inert) so it never throws outside
 * a Page. The written value drives any predicate referencing `page.<var>`
 * (e.g. another component's `visible` / `visibility`).
 *
 * `view` is resolved through {@link useElementDataSource} rather than read off
 * the binding directly (objectstack#6953). This block used to take `object` /
 * `filter` / `sort` / `limit` off `schema.dataSource` and DROP `view`, so
 * `dataSource: { object: 'account', view: 'hot' }` — the spec's own example —
 * built an unfiltered picker over every account instead of the rows the saved
 * view selects. That symptom is quieter than the one objectstack#5576 fixed on
 * `list-view`: nothing errors, the list is simply WIDER than what was authored,
 * which is exactly the failure an AI-authored page hides best.

  // uses (objectui#5637). They failed in two different ways, and only pinning
  // both explains why this is one change:
  //
  //   placeholder={ en, 'zh-CN' }  THREW `Objects are not valid as a React child`
  //   label={ en, 'zh-CN' }        rendered "Owner" — ENGLISH, to a zh-CN viewer
  //   label={ 'zh-CN', ja }        rendered NOTHING — the label element vanished
  //
  // The last two came from `toText`, whose object branch ends
  // `String(o.label ?? o.name ?? o.title ?? o.en ?? '')`. Reaching `o.en`
  // unconditionally is an ENGLISH PICK wearing locale resolution's clothes, and
  // its `?? ''` miss meets the `{label && …}` render site below — so a map that
  // simply omits English DELETED the label element, with nothing thrown and
  // nothing logged.
  //
  // ⛔ `toText` is deliberately not the fix site and is UNCHANGED. It is SHARED
  // with the row values (`toText(row?.[labelField])` below), which are record
  // FIELD VALUES, not `I18nLabel` — teaching it locale resolution would change
  // a second, unrelated call site whose contract is not this one.
  //
  // The placeholder default is applied BEFORE resolution, matching `emptyText`:
  // an absent key still means "Select a record…", and an authored `''` still
  // renders empty because `pickLocalized` passes either string through
  // untouched. `label` takes no default — absent resolves to `''`, which the
  // `{label && …}` site drops exactly as it always did.
  //
  // KNOWN GAP — the `translateLabel` half of this card's ruling is NOT applied
  // here. The sibling `label` read sites compose
  // `translateLabel(pickLocalized(…), language)`, but `translateLabel` and its
  // `KNOWN_LABEL_DICT` are module-private to
  // `renderers/layout/containers.tsx`, which this change's fence marks
  // out-of-scope; reaching them needs either an export from that file or a hoist
  // into a shared module, and `basic/ -> layout/` would be a new dependency
  // between renderer families. Tracked separately (objectui#5637 report).
  const label = pickLocalized(props.label, language);
  const placeholder = pickLocalized(props.placeholder ?? 'Select a record…', language);
  // `emptyText` is `string | I18nLabel`, and its destination is a TEXT NODE, so
  // it resolves through `pickLocalized` — the objectui-side helper the sibling
  // text-node sites read through (`element:text.content`,
  // `element:button.label`, `page:card.title`), which spells a miss as `''`
  // rather than the spec resolver's `undefined`. Before this the map arm was
  // handed to React as a child object, which React REFUSES rather than
  // stringifies: the whole picker subtree threw
  // `Objects are not valid as a React child`, the same pre-fix harm measured
  // for `schema.label` in `inline-locale-label-read-sites.test.tsx`.

// failed assertion among them. Nothing in this repo mocks `@object-ui/core`, and

      // contract has been `string | Record< string, string >` since rc.6 widened
      // it to the same `I18nLabel` union it widened everywhere else, and since
      // objectui#3832 this entry could spell that union — but it deliberately
      // did NOT, because THIS RENDERER passed the value straight into a text
      // node with no locale resolution, and declaring an arm the renderer drops
      // advertises a shape that never reaches the screen. That narrowing was
      // correct for exactly as long as it was true. objectui#5590 made the
      // render site resolve the map (`pickLocalized`, above), so the second arm
      // is now a shape that DOES reach the screen and withholding it would be
      // the opposite defect — the gate reporting `type-mismatch` on a legal
      // write its own description teaches. Same resolution as
      // `element:text_input.defaultValue`, `element:text.content` and
      // `element:button.label`: declare the arm in the change that makes it
      // render, never before and never after.

      description:
        'Text shown in place of the row list when the query returns no records (renderer default "No records", `record-picker.tsx:213`). Unlike `filter` / `sort` / `limit` this is display-only — it never reaches the query, and a node-level `dataSource` binding does not override it. Accepts either a plain string or an inline per-locale map (`{ en: "None", "zh-CN": "无记录" }`) — the `I18nLabel` union rc.6 widened this key to — and the renderer resolves the map against the active language at the read site, falling back through base language, `default`, then `en`. An authored empty string stays empty; the "No records" default applies only when the key is absent.',
