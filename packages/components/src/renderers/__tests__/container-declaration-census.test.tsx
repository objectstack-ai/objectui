/**
 * The seven semantic sectioning tags and `aspect-ratio` declare the containment
 * they render (objectui#6764) — and the two CONTROLS that keep this a census
 * rather than a sweep.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at all
 *
 * The same defect has now been found three times, one registration at a time:
 * objectui#3900 (`page-header`, closed), objectui#6740 (`flex`, PR #6762), and
 * this card. Each was filed as a one-off because nothing in the tree asks "does
 * this registration render a child list while declaring it takes none?".
 *
 * The reasoning that makes the declaration correct is objectui#3900's, written
 * out at `packages/layout/src/index.ts`: `children` is a BASE property of every
 * node in the JSON protocol (`BASE_PROPS` in `sdui-parser/src/validate.ts`), not
 * a per-component authoring key, so `isContainer` answers the protocol question
 * "does this node accept a child list?" and widens no spec surface. Omitting it
 * never made children illegal — nothing on the render path reads the flag — it
 * made `validateTree` LIE, and a warning that lies is worse than a missing one
 * because it trains authors (AI authors especially) to discount the TRUE
 * `not-a-container` reports on components that really are childless.
 *
 * ## MEASURED on b98352a15, over the live registry, not over the source
 *
 * Every registered key was rendered through the real `SchemaRenderer` with one
 * `text` child and put through `validateTree`. Of 131 bare authoring tags:
 *
 *   - 58 render `schema.children` (the child text reached the DOM);
 *   - 5 of those declared the flag — `flex`, `grid`, `card`, `container`,
 *     `stack`, exactly the control set objectui#6764 named, which is what makes
 *     the rest a reading rather than a broken scan;
 *   - 53 did not, and every one drew `not-a-container` on a child list it then
 *     rendered;
 *   - 73 render no children and correctly keep the diagnostic;
 *   - 0 failed to render, so nothing was scored on an exception.
 *
 * This file pins the 8 that this change declares. The other 45 are reported on
 * the card: they are NOT swept in here, because the three exception populations
 * below prove the predicate has real exceptions -- `tabs` (renders
 * `items[].content`), the void tags out of the same loop factory as 34 that do
 * render children, and the former `schema.body` readers, which objectui#6771
 * converged on `children` and objectui#6804's ruling keeps undeclared.
