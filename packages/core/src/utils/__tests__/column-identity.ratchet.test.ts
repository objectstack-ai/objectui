 *
 * Ratchet — the column-identity dual read (`field` ?? `name`) may only shrink.
 *
 * objectui#3104. A column's identity used to be read in two incompatible
 * precedences across the repo, and the two halves landed on different fields
 * for the same column (see `ListView.columnIdentity.test.tsx` for the repro).
 *
 * **The family is now at zero** (PR2): every column-identity read goes through
 * `columnIdentity()`. What remains in the inventory below is the residue the
 * scanner still matches — reads that share the key names but not the concept.
 * They are listed, not converged, and each says why.
 *
 * This file freezes that state: a new dual read in a new file fails, and an
 * extra one in a listed file fails.
 *
 * Shrinking also fails, deliberately — lower the number here in the same commit
 * that removes the read, so the count in the tree and the count on record never
 * drift apart.
 *
 * If this fails because you added a read: don't. Call `columnIdentity()` from
 * `@object-ui/core` — it resolves canonical-first, so it agrees with the data
 * request instead of racing it. If you genuinely need a new one, add it here
 * WITH a verdict and say why in the PR.
 *
 * The scanner is a line-level heuristic, not a parser: an alternation chain
 * (`||` / `??`) mentioning two or more distinct identity keys as property
 * accesses. That is precise enough to ratchet and loose enough to catch
 * spellings nobody has written yet; it is NOT a judgement that every hit is a
 * defect, which is what `verdict` below records.
 *
 * ## Why this is the gate, and no `no-restricted-syntax` lint rule
 *
 * objectui#3104 PR3 asked for the eslint option to be evaluated on its
 * false-positive rate before adopting it. It was, and the answer is decisive:
 * with the family at zero, **all 11 remaining scanner hits are legitimate** —
 * two-layer joins where both precedences are correct, the form cluster #3090
 * settled the other way, and display fallbacks that merely share the key names.
 * A syntactic rule matching `.field ?? .name` cannot tell any of those from a
 * real dual read, because the distinction is what the keys MEAN in that layer,
 * not how the expression is spelled. Adopting it would mean 11 inline disables
 * on correct code — which trains the next author to reach for the disable, the
 * precise reflex that lets a real one through.
 *
 * The ratchet does what the lint rule cannot: it carries a `verdict` and a
 * `why` per site, so a new hit has to be triaged rather than silenced. The
 * assertion that the family is 0 (below) is exactly the statement that every
 * hit a lint rule would fire on today is a false positive.
