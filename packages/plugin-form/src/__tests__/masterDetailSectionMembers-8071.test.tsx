/**
 * `object-master-detail-form.sections` — the MEMBER shape THIS block reads
 * (objectui#8071, criterion from objectui#8068).
 *
 * The key is registered `{ type: 'array' }` with no `of` and typed `any[]` on
 * `MasterDetailFormSchema`, so every array parses on both declared sides and
 * nothing declared says what a member is. The only prose is the type's own
 * comment, "Parent form sections/fields — passed straight through to
 * ObjectForm", which names the carrier and says nothing about the contract.
 *
 * ## Why it is pinned here and not delegated to the sibling block's pin
 *
 * `MasterDetailForm` builds a `parentSchema` object in its `parentSchema` memo,
 * copies `sections` onto it KEY BY KEY, and renders it through a DIRECTLY
 * imported `<ObjectForm>` — no `SchemaRenderer`, no registry lookup. So the
 * member resolution IS `object-form`'s (pinned next door in
 * `objectFormSectionMembers-8071.test.tsx`), reached through a hand-written
 * copy that can drop a key without any declaration changing — the exact failure
 * that file records twice over for `description` (objectui#9779,
 * objectui#9834).
 *
 * ⛔ What this file therefore does NOT re-assert, because those rows are owned
 * next door and duplicating them would buy nothing: `collapsed` vs
 * `collapsible`, the `name`-alone heading, the untitled trailing bucket, and
 * the `description` blurb. The presentation routing (`simple` / `tabbed`, and
 * the four values this block's `formType` deliberately does not declare) is
 * owned by `masterDetailFormTypeVocabulary.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## The rows
 *
 *   1. a member is a section OBJECT; its `fields` are read as a SET, so the
 *      parent OBJECT's field order wins over the authored member order — and
 *      the block's own `details` are untouched by any of it, which is the half
 *      only this block can state.
 *   2. a member that resolves to NO parent field is dropped WHOLE, heading
 *      included — silently. Measured with a DETAIL column name as the member,
 *      the mistake this composition invites: two field vocabularies on one
 *      node, and only one of them is `sections`'.
 *   3. ⭐ the sharp row. `ObjectForm` builds the parent field pool from
 *      `schema.fields` FIRST and a section resolves its members against that
 *      pool, so authoring both INTERSECTS them: a section member absent from
 *      `fields` does not render, and a section whose every member is absent
 *      disappears heading and all.
 *
 *      ⚠ FLIPPED by objectui#9884, in the direction the sibling rows 4, 6 and
 *      7 next door flipped: it used to pin this as a DIVERGENCE from the
 *      block's own registration, which declared `fields` "Ignored when
 *      `sections` is given — sections carry their own field lists", and to
 *      record the loss as having "no diagnostic". objectui#8071 slice 15 handed
 *      that back as a finding rather than fixing it, because fixing it changes
 *      either the renderer or the declaration and that card wrote pins only.
 *      objectui#9884 ruled it: the DECLARATION was the wrong half. One
 *      `SimpleObjectForm` renders this block's parent half and `object-form`
 *      alike (`MasterDetailForm`'s `parentSchema` memo literally builds a
 *      `{ type: 'object-form', ... }` node), and the three sibling `fields`
 *      registrations — `object-form`, `form`, `embeddable-form` — all declare
 *      the key as the field selection with no such exemption, with
 *      `objectFormFieldsMembers-8071` pinning it as one. Honouring the
 *      exemption would therefore have falsified three declarations to satisfy
 *      one, on a pool that also feeds values, create defaults and the submitted
 *      set. So the sentence was corrected and the SILENCE — the half that was
 *      a defect under either reading — was closed instead: rows 3 and 3b pin
 *      that every loss is now named by `warnSectionMemberExcludedByFields`, 3c
 *      is the firing control, and 3d keeps the warning off row 2's different
 *      silence. ⛔ The rendered outcome did not move: row 3's two DOM
 *      assertions are the ones slice 15 wrote.
 *   4. the non-vacuity control: with no `sections` the same parent fields
 *      render flat and no divider is drawn, so every absence above is about a
 *      form that drew something.
