/**
 * ObjectUI's `list-view` node historically used a different vocabulary from
 * `@objectstack/spec` for the same concepts (`fields` where the spec says
 * `columns`, `viewType` where it says `type`, …). Issue #2231 closed the
 * type-level fork; #2890 closes the vocabulary fork.
 *
 * Stored view metadata in user databases still carries the legacy keys, so the
 * renderer cannot simply stop accepting them. Per AGENTS.md Commandment #0.1 the
 * answer is NOT a per-read-site `??` fallback — those fossilize a second de-facto
 * contract and drift apart (they already had: `ObjectGrid` preferred `columns`
 * in one branch and `fields` in another). Instead legacy acceptance lives HERE,
 * in one documented normalizer at the component boundary, mirroring
 * `normalizeSchemaReferenceKeys` (object schemas) and the spec's own
 * `normalizeVisibleWhen` / `normalizeFilterOperator` migration bridges.
 *
 * Note this cannot be a `z.preprocess` on `ListViewSchema`: nothing on the
 * render path parses view metadata through zod (the zod schemas are used by the
 * CLI validator, the VS Code extension and tests only), so a schema-level fold
 * would never run. The guarantee comes from the call site instead — `ListView`
 * normalizes before it reads anything.
 *
 * The fold is deliberately one-directional: the canonical key wins when both are
 * present, and the legacy key is REMOVED from the result so a read-site that was
 * missed fails loudly instead of quietly taking the legacy path. Like a spec
 * migration bridge, this is expected to be dropped in a future major once stored
 * metadata has been migrated.
 *
 * Non-mutating and allocation-frugal: returns the input by reference when there
 * is nothing to fold, so `ListView`'s downstream `useMemo`s keep a stable
 * dependency identity on the common (already-canonical) path.
 *
 * Currently folded:
 *  - `fields` → `columns` (#2890 scope A step 1)
 *  - `densityMode` → `rowHeight` (#2890 scope A step 2)
 *  - the `show*` toolbar flags → `userActions` (#2890 scope A step 3), and
 *    `showDescription` → `appearance.showDescription`. The canonical key wins
 *    per-flag, so a view may carry `userActions` for some toggles and a legacy
 *    flag for others. NOTE the fold does not apply any default: an absent flag
 *    stays absent, because the defaults are per-toggle (search/sort/filter/
 *    rowHeight/group default ON, hideFields/rowColor default OFF) and belong to
 *    the renderer, not to the vocabulary bridge.
 *  - `aria: { label, describedBy }` → the spec's `AriaProps`
 *    (`{ ariaLabel, ariaDescribedBy }`), and `sharing: { visibility, enabled }`
 *    → the spec's `ViewSharing` (`{ type }`) — #2890 scope A step 5. `aria.live`
 *    survives untouched: it has no spec counterpart.
 *  - `filters` → `filter` (#2890 scope A step 4). A key rename only: BOTH keys
 *    carry an ObjectQL FilterNode array (`[['stage','=','won']]`) everywhere in
 *    objectui — every consumer passes the value straight to `$filter`. The spec
 *    types `filter` as `ViewFilterRule[]` (`{field, operator, value}` objects),
 *    so objectui's field is typed from the spec but used as something else.
 *    That mismatch is real and out of scope here; converting formats inside a
 *    vocabulary fold would change what reaches the data source.
 *  - `data: { provider: 'object', object }` → `objectName` (#7477, step 6 of
 *    #2890). This is the spelling the published `react-blocks` contract
 *    recommends and the one `@objectstack/spec`'s `ViewDataSchema` declares;
 *    ListView read it at ZERO sites, so a page bound that way validated green
 *    upstream and rendered an empty list here with no diagnostic. The `object`
 *    provider is a `strictObject` carrying exactly `{ provider, object }`, so
 *    `objectName` captures all of it. Two deliberate departures from the folds
 *    above, both narrowing:
 *      · an already-present `objectName` WINS — this fold only fills a gap, it
 *        never re-points a binding that already resolves;
 *      · `data` is NOT deleted. Every other fold deletes because the legacy key
 *        has one meaning and one home; `data` has four providers, `api`/`value`
 *        are read live in `ListView`, and the whole block is FORWARDED to child
 *        views (the gantt branch), whose own `getDataConfig` reads `data` before
 *        `objectName`. Deleting it for one provider would rewrite what a child
 *        resolves. Nothing in `ListView` reads `data.provider === 'object'`, so
 *        keeping it cannot create a second de-facto contract inside the renderer.
 *  - `viewType`: a missing kind, or the view CATEGORY `'list'` that AI-authored
 *    metadata stores and hosts forward verbatim, becomes the renderable `'grid'`
 *    — otherwise it reaches the renderer's typeless default branch and shows as
 *    a red "Unknown component type" box. Before that default applies, the
 *    AUTHOR's kind is read (#7477): `specType` — the slot
 *    `components/renderers/layout/react-page.tsx` parks a react-tier `type` in
 *    when the SDUI envelope claims the `type` key (ADR-0078) — and then a bare
 *    `type` when it names a kind ListView draws, which the component
 *    discriminator (`'list-view'`) never does. Same two legs, same order, as
 *    `normalizeChartSchema`'s chart-family read. An explicit `viewType` still
 *    wins: this leg only fills the gap that used to resolve to `'grid'`.
 *  - each `columns` entry's IDENTITY — `name` / `fieldName` → the spec's `field`
 *    (#3104). This one MIRRORS instead of deleting, for the reason given on
 *    {@link normalizeColumnIdentities}: `columns` entries cross the package
 *    boundary into host renderers, so dropping `name` from under them is a
 *    breaking change with no inventory. Runs AFTER the `fields` → `columns` fold
 *    above, so a view that spells its column list the legacy way still gets its
 *    entries canonicalized.
 *  - the four PER-VIEW-TYPE config aliases phase 3 carried over
 *    ({@link PER_VIEW_CONFIG_ALIASES}): `kanban.groupField` → `groupByField`,
 *    `kanban.cardFields` → `columns`, `gallery.imageField` → `coverField`,
 *    `timeline.dateField` → `startDateField`. One read-site changes behaviour
 *    as a result, and it is a CORRECTION of the same inverted precedence A2
 *    fixed for `densityMode`: `ListView`'s kanban adapter resolves
 *    `cardFields || columns`, i.e. legacy over canonical, so a config carrying
 *    BOTH used to render the legacy value. After the fold the canonical
 *    `columns` reaches it. Every other reader of these four was already
 *    canonical-first and is unaffected.
