 * objectui#11564: the `flex` bag's child LIST is typed as nodes on the
 * TypeScript face, as a single child already was, pinned.
 *
 * ## The gap
 *
 * `FlexBlockNode` was read off the `FlexBlockSchema` arm, whose bag member
 * `children` is `FLEX_BAG_CHILDREN`: a single node (`SchemaNodeSchema`) or
 * `z.array(z.unknown())`. The zod faces need the `unknown`: a list at
 * `properties.children` is a position `@objectstack/spec`'s page walk
 * descends, and each entry is judged there, once, at its real path
 * (`flex-properties-bag-11276.test.ts` pins that on both faces). On the
 * TypeScript face the same member read `unknown[]`, so the list, the form a
 * `flex` node is authored in, took any entry while a single child was judged
 * as a node. With `BaseSchema`'s index signature present nothing showed, since
 * the signature absorbs a misspelled key either way; once objectui#8347
 * removes it, the list would have been the one unchecked node slot.
 *
 * ## What is pinned here
 *
 * TYPE-level rows, judged by this package's `type-check` (its
 * `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` leg), never by vitest:
 *
 *   - the bag's `children` is one node or a list of nodes, the flat mirror's
 *     own member, and it is the only member that differs from the arm;
 *   - a closed node's misspelling inside the list is refused today. A
 *     spec-derived node carries no index signature, so it is the shape every
 *     node has after objectui#8347; the control is the same document typed
 *     the way the arm reads it, which compiles;
 *   - an undeclared `type` and a nested array inside the list are refused,
 *     and a primitive entry compiles, as in every node slot.
 *
 * A runtime leg reads the two zod faces on the same entries, so the one kind
 * where the faces differ (a nested array) is measured here rather than stated.
 * That divergence is recorded in `zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`'s `EXCLUSIONS`
 * row for `layout.zod.ts#FlexBlockSchema`.
