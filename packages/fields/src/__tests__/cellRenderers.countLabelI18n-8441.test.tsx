/**
 * objectui#8441 — the `repeater` cell counted its rows in hardcoded Chinese,
 * and the `file` cell counted its files in hardcoded English.
 *
 * ## What was measured before anything moved
 *
 * `getCellRenderer('repeater')` returned an inline arrow that rendered the row
 * count followed by a Chinese unit word (U+9879, spelled as an escape
 * throughout this file — AGENTS.md #-1 governs comments and source too). Every
 * reader on every locale saw it, English ones included, next to the English
 * siblings `[Vector]`, `[Grid]` and `FileCellRenderer`'s `N files` on the same
 * detail page. Two rules broke on one literal: #-1 (English-only codebase) and
 * "it bypasses i18n entirely".
 *
 * ## Why the fix is the i18n channel and not "make it English"
 *
 * Maintainer ruling on the card: making it English answers only the FIRST of
 * the two rules the card names — "every reader on every locale sees an
 * unlocalized literal" survives verbatim, in another language. The channel
 * (`useFieldTranslate` -> `useObjectTranslation`) was already imported by this
 * very file and already used by `DateCellRenderer`, `DateTimeCellRenderer`,
 * `ImageCellRenderer` and `FormulaCellRenderer`, so routing costs no new
 * dependency and no new published surface.
 *
 * `FileCellRenderer` rides along for the same reason: it spelled the same
 * concept `count === 1 ? 'file' : 'files'` two hundred lines up. That is not a
 * rule violation — it is English — but a two-branch ternary cannot spell `ru`'s
 * four plural categories or `ar`'s six, and two adjacent cells answering one
 * concept two ways is the shape the ruling closes.
 *
 * ## The shape of the assertions here, and why each one is needed
 *
 * - **Every pin reads RENDERED DOM TEXT**, never source text. A source-text
 *   assertion passes the day someone re-adds the literal through a constant.
 * - **A LIT CONTROL for the channel, in this same run.** Every negative
 *   assertion below ("no U+9879 survives", "no English survives") is also
 *   satisfied by a provider that never mounted and a pack that never loaded.
 *   The control renders `detail.unresolvedReference` — a key that resolved
 *   through THIS file's `useFieldTranslate` before this card — under `ru`, and
 *   asserts the Russian value. If it fails, nothing else here means anything.
 * - **`ru` is the non-English leg, not `zh`, and that is load-bearing.**
 *   `Intl.PluralRules('ru').select(2)` is `few`, a category no pack in this
 *   repo enumerates, so count 2 can only be answered by the BASE key — in
 *   Russian, from the `ru` pack. A leg that renders English there is
 *   objectui#3863 reopened. `zh` is asserted too, because the same Chinese
 *   string that was the DEFECT as a source literal is the CORRECT rendering as
 *   a pack value, and only a locale-varying assertion can tell those apart.
 * - **The provider-less English fallback is pinned byte-equal to the `en`
 *   pack.** `check:i18n-keys` compares an inline `defaultValue` against the
 *   pack; this call site's fallback is a ternary, not that shape, so the gate
 *   cannot see it. This pin is the comparison instead — the same duty
 *   `userCell.unresolvedReference-8434.test.tsx` performs for its sentence.
 * - **The table entry is pinned STABLE across `getCellRenderer` calls.**
 *   `getCellRenderer` rebuilds `standardMap` on every call and both call sites
 *   (`DetailSection`, `renderFieldValue`) resolve inside render, so an inline
 *   arrow is a new component TYPE per render: React unmounts and remounts the
 *   cell, taking react-i18next's language subscription with it. Hoisting the
 *   renderer to a module-level function is what makes the hook safe to hold,
 *   and identity is the only observable that says so.
 *
 * ## The call mechanism this card's premise turned on
 *
 * The ruling made the fix conditional on hooks being legal in that table. Both
 * halves were measured on `origin/main` before a line was written: four table
 * entries already call hooks, and every call site renders the resolved value as
 * a JSX ELEMENT (`<CellRenderer value={…} field={…} />` in
 * `plugin-detail/src/DetailSection.tsx`, `<Renderer … />` in
 * `plugin-dashboard/src/recordFields.tsx` and
 * `fields/src/widgets/lookupColumnDisplay.tsx`), never a plain call. The tests
 * below render through the same shape.
 *
 * ## What this file deliberately does NOT pin
 *
 * The `[Vector]` / `[Grid]` placeholders in the same table. They are a
 * different class — type placeholders, not count phrases — the card did not
 * measure them, and the ruling fenced them off. Pinning their current text here
 * would read as an endorsement of it.
