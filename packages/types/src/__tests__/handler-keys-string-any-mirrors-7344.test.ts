/**
 * The 8 `on*` handler keys that PR #7339's census could not see — four
 * declared the handler-expression STRING dialect (`z.string()`), three declared
 * `z.any()`, one declared `z.function()` in a multi-line spelling — now REFUSE
 * BY NAME (objectui#7344).
 *
 * ## The rulings this executes
 *
 *   - objectui#6182 (maintainer, 2026-08-25, batch 4, 「同意」, option A): the
 *     handler-expression string dialect is NOT a supported authoring form, on
 *     either face. Its consequence clause sends the `z.string()` handler mirrors
 *     into objectui#6124's per-key sweep "with the same treatment".
 *   - objectui#6124 (maintainer, 2026-08-30, 「批次 #8 同意」; PR #7339): the
 *     treatment's SHAPE. zod face: a named refusal arm (`handlerKeyRefusal`,
 *     `../zod/tombstone.zod.ts`), no expression arm, no declarative-object arm.
 *     TypeScript face, measured per key: a function type only where a runtime
 *     consumer reads the key as a function, else `?: never`.
 *
 * ## Why #7339 missed these
 *
 * Its census anchored on `on*: z.function(` — one line, one spelling. The four
 * `z.string()` sites and the three `z.any()` sites never matched; the eighth,
 * `CalendarViewSchema.onEventClick`, WAS `z.function()` but spelled over three
 * lines (`z` ⏎ `.function()` ⏎ `.optional()`). Two of the three families were
 * worse than the one #7339 fixed: an authored string parsed GREEN on all seven
 * (the mirror was WIDER than the declaration — objectui#7069's direction) and
 * then reached a slot that calls it, throwing `onBack is not a function` at
 * click (the objectui#4453 shape: an authored string handler that runs nothing
 * and is refused nowhere).
 *
 * ## Per-key measurement (the TypeScript disposition), on `origin/main` @ `d88e20f55`
 *
 * RUNTIME SLOT — a host-supplied function REACHES a renderer:
 *   - `views.zod.ts#DetailViewSchema.onBack` — `detail-view`'s registration
 *     (`plugin-detail/src/index.tsx`) spreads the node's keys onto `DetailView`
 *     (`{...props}` after `SchemaRenderer`'s `...componentProps`), whose
 *     `handleBack` CALLS `onBack()` when set (`DetailView.tsx`). The TS twin
 *     declared `string`; the consumer's own prop is `() => void`, so the twin
 *     now declares what the renderer invokes.
 *   - `crud.zod.ts#DetailSchema.onBack` — `ComponentRegistry.register('detail',
 *     DetailView)` (`plugin-detail/src/index.tsx`), the same `handleBack`.
 *   - `crud.zod.ts#DetailSchema.onNavigate` and `.onAddComment` — objectui#7804,
 *     added on the batch #69 ruling. ⚠️ They do NOT belong to this file's
 *     origin story: neither was ever `z.string()` or `z.any()`, so #7339's
 *     anchor could not have missed them — they were declared on NEITHER face,
 *     which is why `.passthrough()` KEPT them and the repo gate
 *     `check:handler-key-reads` carried them as `KNOWN_UNDECLARED_READS` rows.
 *     They are ledgered here because this file owns the `crud.zod.ts#DetailSchema`
 *     pair, and its per-key assertions are exactly what they need.
 *     Measured per key, and the two channels are NOT the same one:
 *       - `onNavigate` — `DetailView` reads it in its OWN body and CALLS it
 *         (`handleBack`, `handleEdit`, the post-delete redirect). The `'detail'`
 *         registration is the RAW component, so the authored value arrives by
 *         identity with nothing interposed.
 *       - `onAddComment` — `DetailView` never calls it; it FORWARDS it as a
 *         React prop into `<RecordComments>`, whose submit handler awaits it,
 *         behind a `schema.comments` gate that the same passthrough keeps alive.
 *     Both driven through the real `SchemaRenderer` in
 *     `plugin-detail/src/__tests__/detail-handler-slots-7804.test.tsx`, where
 *     the base reading was: an authored `{ action: 'toast' }` parsed GREEN on
 *     both keys and survived into the parsed output, while `onBack` — the lit
 *     control on the same arm — was refused.
 *   - `crud.zod.ts#ActionSchema.onClick` — `ActionRunner.ts` `await
 *     action.onClick()` (two sites); `action-menu.tsx`, `containers.tsx`,
 *     `record-quick-actions.tsx` all `typeof action.onClick === 'function'`.
 *   - `complex.zod.ts#CalendarViewSchema.onEventClick` — `calendar-view`'s
 *     `pickHostCallbacks` forwards it when it is a function
 *     (`calendar-view-renderer.tsx`), the sibling of `onViewChange`'s arm.
 *
 * RETIRED — nothing reads the KEY (`?: never` on the TypeScript face). ⚠️ The
 * subject is the KEY, never the array it sits in. This entry used to read
 * "`AppComponentSchema.actions[]` has no reader in `@object-ui/layout`,
 * `@object-ui/app-shell` or the console" — literally true, and true ONLY
 * because of that hand-written three-package scope; `@object-ui/runner` was
 * outside it and reads the array. Stripped of the scope it became the flat
 * "nothing reads `AppComponentSchema.actions[]`" that the objectui#7344
 * changeset was about to publish as `@object-ui/types` CHANGELOG copy
 * (objectui#7721). Re-measured whole-tree:
 *   - `app.zod.ts#AppActionSchema.onClick` — `AppComponentSchema.actions[]` IS
 *     read, by exactly ONE package: `@object-ui/runner`, whose `LayoutRenderer`
 *     renders the `'button'` arm as toolbar buttons and the `'user'` arm as an
 *     avatar dropdown. What no reader touches is `onClick` itself — not on the
 *     action, and no longer on `AppAction.items`, where that same renderer
 *     reached one through an `as any` cast until objectui#6854 deleted it
 *     (guarded from the renderer side by
 *     `packages/runner/src/__tests__/LayoutRenderer.appActionItems-6854.test.tsx`).
 *     The reader set is now ASSERTED rather than narrated: the census below
 *     reads its population off the tree, so a reader appearing in a package
 *     nobody thought to list fails loudly instead of narrowing the claim in
 *     silence. `AppAction` is still imported nowhere outside `packages/types`
 *     — the runner reaches the array structurally, through
 *     `AppComponentSchema`.
 *   - `reports.zod.ts#ReportBuilderSchema.onSave` / `.onCancel` — no renderer is
 *     registered for `report-builder` (control on the same tree:
 *     `register('detail-view'` and `register('report-designer'` both resolve).
 *   - `crud.zod.ts#CRUDDialogSchema.onClose` — no renderer is registered for
 *     `crud-dialog`; zero references to `CRUDDialogSchema` outside
 *     `packages/types` and the docs index.
 *
 * NONE read the key as a STRING and dispatched it — the third class the card
 * reserved for the decision box did not occur on this tree.
 *
 * ## Excluded by ruling, verified by describe text
 *
 * `views.zod.ts` still declares three `on*: z.string()` keys — `onViewChange`
 * (`ViewSwitcherSchema`), `onChange` (`FilterUISchema`), `onChange`
 * (`SortUISchema`). They are event NAMES dispatched on `window` (PR #6899), not
 * handler expressions; each `.describe()` says so verbatim, and the census below
 * pins that wording as the reason the three survive the anchor.
 *
 * ## The engine the `git grep` census requires (objectui#8361)
 *
 * The reader census below shells out to `git grep`, and every one of its
 * anchors uses `\b` (two also use `\s`). POSIX ERE defines NEITHER: GNU regex
 * adds them as extensions, the BSD regex library Apple Git links against does
 * not. Under `-E` that difference is silent and total — on a stock macOS host
 * every anchor matched nothing, the census read a tree with zero readers, and
 * all five assertions failed saying "the anchor is dead", which sent a reader
 * hunting for a tree change that had not happened. CI, on Linux, was green on
 * the same bytes.
 *
 * So the anchors run through `-P` (PCRE, which has `\b` on both hosts), and the
 * `engine self-test` describe below is the VERIFIER of that choice rather than
 * an assumption about it: it probes a synthetic corpus in a temp dir and fails,
 * naming the git it ran on, if that git has no PCRE or if its `\b` is not a
 * word boundary. `gitGrepFiles` was hardened in the same direction — only exit
 * 1 ("no matches") is still read as a reading; any other status is reported as
 * the TOOL failing instead of being laundered into an empty census.
 *
 * ## Predictions, written before the first run (red-first)
 *
 * On the unmodified tree (`origin/main` @ `d88e20f55`):
 *   - the single-line census finds 10 sites, not the 3 event-name keys; the
 *     multi-line census finds 1 (`complex.zod.ts` `onEventClick`), not 0;
 *   - no site carries the objectui#6124 guidance in its description;
 *   - an authored STRING parses GREEN on the seven `z.string()` / `z.any()`
 *     sites and is refused with `invalid_type` (not `custom`) on `onEventClick`;
 *   - a live function parses GREEN on the `z.any()` three and on `onEventClick`,
 *     and is refused with `invalid_type` on the `z.string()` four;
 *   - the whole-document counter-probe parses `onBack: 'goBack'` GREEN;
 *   - `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` reports TS2344 on every `RetiredIsNever` and
 *     `StringIsGone` line, and on `KeepsFunction<DetailViewSchema['onBack']>`.
 * The `{}`-parses-green probes and the instrument controls are GREEN before and
 * after — they pin the instrument, not this change.
