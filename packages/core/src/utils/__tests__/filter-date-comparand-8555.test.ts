/**
 * A `Date` comparand through `convertFiltersToAST` — objectui#8555.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The operator-object arm opened on `typeof value === 'object' &&
 * !Array.isArray(value)`. A `Date` passes both tests, so it entered the
 * operator loop — and `Object.entries(someDate)` is `[]`, so the loop body
 * never ran and NO condition was pushed for that field.
 *
 * Not refused, not lowered wrongly: ABSENT. `{ status: 'a', created: someDate }`
 * lowered to `['status', '=', 'a']`, which is a WIDER result set than the author
 * asked for, with nothing thrown and nothing logged — the one failure direction
 * this file exists to avoid.
 *
 * It also made the field's fate depend on its SIBLINGS. With the Date alone,
 * `conditions` ended empty and `convertFiltersToAST` returned the ORIGINAL
 * OBJECT untouched, so the shape survived by accident and the defect only
 * appeared once a second field was present. That asymmetry is part of the bug;
 * section 2 is what pins it closed.
 *
 * ## The ruling — LOWER it, and the spec is what decides that
 *
 * This is the OPPOSITE answer to objectui#8514, which was resolved as a refusal
 * precisely because the spec DECLINED to rule on that shape. Here it rules,
 * measured against `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 and pinned in section 3:
 *
 *   - `ACCEPTED_FILTER_COMPARAND_TYPES` is
 *     `['string','number','bigint','boolean','null','Date']` — `Date` is a
 *     first-class literal comparand, and `isAcceptedFilterComparand(new Date())`
 *     is `true`.
 *   - `parseFilterAST(['created', '=', d])` hands back `{ created: d }` with the
 *     Date INSTANCE intact.
 *
 * So the wire-form question the card raised ("ISO string? epoch?") is answered
 * by NOT answering it here: the AST leaf carries the `Date`, exactly as the
 * operator arm has always emitted it for `{ created: { $gte: d } }`.
 * Stringifying in this arm would make the shorthand and the operator form emit
 * two different comparand types for one author intent.
 *
 * ## What carries the weight — three legs, RUN rather than predicted
 *
 * Each was applied to the committed implementation, proved on disk in both
 * directions, and restored by state. The counts and MODES below are measured,
 * not expected — one of them corrected the prediction written here first.
 *
 * 1. **Ablation** — the arm removed. 7 of 16 red. MODE: a MISSING condition.
 *    `{ status, created }` produces `['status', '=', 'a']` and `node[2]` is
 *    `undefined`. Sections 1 and 2 both carry it.
 * 2. **`value.toISOString()`** — the plausible wrong fix, since "what wire
 *    form?" is the question the card asks. 6 of 16 red. MODE: the right node
 *    with the WRONG COMPARAND TYPE — `'2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'` where a Date
 *    was expected.
 *    ⚠️ This paragraph first claimed only the `instanceof Date` and
 *    operator-parity pins would discriminate. Measured, six do: every
 *    `toEqual([..., D])` in sections 1 and 2 reddens too, because a string is
 *    not deep-equal to a Date. The correction that matters runs the other way —
 *    §2's "lone and sibling forms lower the SAME field" pin does NOT redden
 *    here, because the caricature is symmetric too. Symmetry alone never
 *    discriminates a wrong comparand type; the `instanceof` / `toBe(D)` pins
 *    are what do, and they are in their own `it()` blocks so no earlier
 *    assertion can stop them running (objectui#8506, objectui#8514).
 * 3. **`Object.keys(value).length === 0` as the gate** — handles the Date and
 *    reads EVERY entry-less object as an equality comparand. 2 of 16 red, both
 *    in section 4, and NOTHING else: for a Date input this caricature is
 *    byte-identical to the shipped fix, which is exactly why section 4 has to
 *    exist. MODE: over-promotion — `{}` and `/x/` appear in comparand position
 *    (`['created', '=', {}]`), and a RegExp comparand is one
 *    `normalizeFilterComparandTypes` refuses outright, so the caricature moves
 *    the failure downstream instead of removing it.
 *    ⚠️ Those three counts DATE FROM objectui#8555's own tree. objectui#8567
 *    then turned section 4's RegExp case from a silent-drop negative into a
 *    refusal, so re-running any of these legs today reads against a different
 *    section 4. The MODES are unchanged; the numbers are historical.
