/**
 * objectui#8488 — what `InspectorSelectField`'s trigger renders for a stored
 * value the option roster does NOT offer.
 *
 * Radix renders a controlled value matching no `SelectItem` as nothing at all,
 * so such a value used to paint a BLANK trigger — pixel-identical to "this
 * field is unset". The author sees an empty control, picks a value to fill it
 * in, and silently overwrites a key they were never shown.
 *
 * Eight call sites had hand-rolled it. THREE flagged the synthesised row, in
 * three wordings: `ActionTargetField` ("(not found)"), `ViewColumnInspector`'s
 * field picker ("(not in object)") and `FlowNodeConfigField`'s select branch
 * ("(deprecated)", framework#4278 / ADR-0090 D3). The other FIVE —
 * `ReportDefaultInspector`'s type, dataset and both chart axes, and
 * `ViewVariantInspector`'s type — appended the raw value with NO marker, which
 * is the refused direction: it makes "stored" and "offered" the same picture.
 * The rule is the primitive's now; only the wording stayed with the call site,
 * through `unknownValueLabel`.
 *
 * ## What these cases assert, and why it is the trigger text
 *
 * The pin reads the RENDERED TRIGGER, never `options.length` or the synthesised
 * entry's presence in some array. An implementation that appends the row but
 * fails to surface it — the exact shape of the original bug, since Radix's
 * blank trigger coexisted with a perfectly good `value` prop — passes an
 * options-array assertion and fails these.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The placeholder is not the repair (the "empty ≠ unknown" pin)
 *
 * `unknown value renders differently from an empty one` is the case that fails
 * on the tempting wrong fix: papering the unknown value over with `placeholder`
 * would assert "nothing is stored" about a field that IS storing something —
 * confidently wrong rather than merely blank. objectui#8450 owns the empty
 * half (empty draws the placeholder) and it must keep owning it, so the two
 * states are read side by side here rather than one at a time.
 *
 * ## Boundary, measured and deliberately NOT repaired here
 *
 * The primitive cannot tell "roster is empty" from "roster has not loaded yet",
 * so a valid value briefly wears the flag while an async picker
 * (`useMetaOptions`, `useObjectFields`, `datasetOptions`) is still fetching.
 * That is inherited behaviour, not new: `ViewColumnInspector`'s hand-rolled
 * copy had exactly the same blind spot before this change. Filed separately.
