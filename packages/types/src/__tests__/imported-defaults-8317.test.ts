/**
 * THE IMPORT BOUNDARY — "this mirror authors no default, imported subschemas
 * included" (objectui#8317, director ruling, decision batch #90, 2026-09-08,
 * under the maintainer's standing delegation).
 *
 * Batch #69 (objectui#7735) ruled the principle: *a validator validates; it
 * does not write values into an author's document.* PR #8299 delivered it for
 * the 41 `.default()` call sites this repository wrote. Batch #90 ruled that
 * the principle holds for EVERY key `safeValidateSchema` answers, so the 57
 * `ZodDefault` nodes that arrived by reference from `@objectstack/spec` are
 * stripped where the spec enters this package (`../zod/imported-defaults.ts`).
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and why each half is here
 *
 * The count itself lives next door in `zod-mirror-authors-no-defaults-7735.test.ts`
 * (the graph walk that priced #8299, now a ratchet at zero). This file pins the
 * three properties that make that zero SAFE rather than merely true:
 *
 *  1. **The accept set does not move.** Measured as a live differential against
 *     the RAW spec schemas — which are importable here, so this is a permanent
 *     pin and not a throwaway measurement. `.default(v)` carries optionality as
 *     well as a value, and a naive unwrap makes an omissible key REQUIRED: a
 *     silent accept-set narrowing on a published surface, which this ruling did
 *     not authorise.
 *  2. **Nothing else changes.** Same keys, same node types, same `def.checks`
 *     at every reachable node — a walk that dropped a `.superRefine()` would
 *     make this package ACCEPT what the spec refuses, and would leave no trace
 *     in any count.
 *  3. **The boundary cannot be bypassed.** A source-level census: every
 *     `@objectstack/spec` import in `../zod/*.zod.ts` is bound through
 *     `stripImportedDefaults`. Without this, the next spec import silently
 *     re-opens the hole and only a residue count — measured on some later day —
 *     would notice.
 *
 * Every assertion below carries a control that fires. A differential whose two
 * sides are the same object, or a census that matched nothing, is green for
 * reasons that have nothing to do with the ruling.
