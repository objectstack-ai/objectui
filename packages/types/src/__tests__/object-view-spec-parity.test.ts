/**
 * ObjectView ↔ @objectstack/spec drift guard (#2890 scope B).
 *
 * The sibling of `list-view-spec-parity.test.ts`, for the node that never had
 * one. The 2026-07 audit (`docs/audits/2026-07-objectview-detailview-schema.md`,
 * PR #2934) opened with exactly this gap: *"Add a drift guard modelled on
 * `list-view-spec-parity.test.ts`. Without one, [making the declaration honest]
 * decays immediately — that test is the only reason `ListViewSchema` stayed
 * honest."* This is that guard, and it lands BEFORE any restructuring so the
 * restructure has a baseline to be measured against.
 *
 * ## What this guard does NOT do, and why
 *
 * The audit's step 1 was "make the declaration match the reads (the 28
 * undeclared keys)". That step has since been **ruled the other way**, and this
 * guard must not quietly re-open it. Maintainer, 2026-08-18 on objectui#5097,
 * verbatim 「同意」: the keys the `renderListView` delegation branch reads off
 * the node are HOST-COMPOSITION surface, not authored surface, and are
 * deliberately NOT declared on `ObjectViewSchema`. Their home is
 * `OBJECT_VIEW_HOST_COMPOSITION_KEYS` in `plugin-view/src/ObjectView.tsx`, and
 * `plugin-view/src/__tests__/objectViewHostSurface.test.tsx` already pins them
 * by name from the side that can actually read the source.
 *
 * So the reads half is guarded, and guarded where it belongs. What had no
 * guard at all is the **declared** surface — which is what this file covers:
 *
 *   1. The declaration is internally consistent: the zod shape and the TS
 *      interface describe the same node. The audit measured them apart (zod 13
 *      keys, TS 25), and nothing caught it. The gap is pinned below so it can
 *      shrink but never grow.
 *   2. Every declared key that has a spec counterpart still has a LIVE one —
 *      see the tombstone section, which is the whole reason this file exists in
 *      the shape it does.
 *   3. No declared key sits outside the sanctioned set, forcing a conscious
 *      promote / keep-local / drop decision on every new field — the same
 *      forcing function `list-view-spec-parity.test.ts` applies.
 *
 * When one of these fails, do NOT edit the sets to make it green. Decide
 * whether the field belongs upstream in `@objectstack/spec` (promote it) or is
 * a genuine objectui-only extension (add it with a rationale). See #2890.
