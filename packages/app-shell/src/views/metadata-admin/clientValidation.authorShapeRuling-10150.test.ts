/**
 * objectui#10150 — the `AUTHOR_SHAPE_ONLY_TYPES` header carries the ruling that
 * keeps `sharing_rule` in the set, at the place its reader meets the condition.
 *
 * ## The trap this keeps shut
 *
 * The header in `clientValidation.ts` used to end on a plan: switch the
 * `sharing_rule` edit gate on once the `_diagnostics` ingress is closed. The
 * ingress was closed (objectui#7603, hoisted by objectui#8181), the switch was
 * put to the maintainer on objectui#7612 with that already measured, and the
 * ruling was option A: the edit door stays with the server. A header that still
 * reads as the plan sends its next reader, who checks the condition and finds
 * it met, straight back to re-filing objectui#7612.
 *
 * ## What this pins
 *
 * NAMED SUBJECTS inside ONE docblock, the one directly above the set: the
 * ruling's card, and the function that closed the ingress. Inside that docblock
 * and not merely somewhere in the file, because a citation moved to another
 * comment is one the reader of the condition never meets.
 *
 * ## What it cannot pin, said here so it is not assumed
 *
 * - ⛔ Not the ruling's wording. The header quotes it verbatim; nothing parses
 *   that quotation, so it is not pinned as text.
 * - ⛔ Not prose intent. A header that cites objectui#7612 AND re-states the
 *   old plan passes here. Catching that is review's job.
 * - ⛔ Not whether the ingress is still closed. That is behaviour, and
 *   `ResourceEditPage.readDecorationStrip.test.tsx` is its instrument.
 *
 * The first case is the lit CONTROL. The same reader finds the measurement the
 * header must keep, and finds it only between the docblock's own bounds, so an
 * empty or misplaced read cannot let the second case pass as a scan of nothing.
 *
 * If a later ruling takes `sharing_rule` out of the set, the header changes in
 * that pull request, and this file changes with it.
