/**
 * objectui#9538 — the stale-entry message in `scripts/check-lint-coverage.mjs`
 * spelled a GitHub closing keyword immediately in front of the issue number it
 * interpolates.
 *
 * ## Why a message's WORDING gets a pin at all
 *
 * That message is written to be QUOTED. The discipline around a `DEBT` entry is
 * to take the INTERMEDIATE reading — the package linted, the entry not yet
 * deleted — and paste the gate's own output into the pull request as proof the
 * work landed. A closing keyword in front of the number therefore does not stay
 * in the script: it travels into a pull-request body, and on merge it ends the
 * anchor card silently, from a body whose author was being careful. GitHub's
 * parser does no sentence parsing, so no hedging in the surrounding sentence
 * reaches it. The reason is written at the ratchet that emits the message; this
 * file is what makes the constraint fail loudly instead of being remembered.
 *
 * The landed precedent is the rule-2 stale-entry message in
 * `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs`, pinned by the
 * `the stale-entry message may not carry a card-closing keyword` block in
 * `scripts/__tests__/spec-symbol-ledger-plugin-detail-7265.test.ts` — cited by
 * the names of the things, not by line address (root `AGENTS.md`, commandment
 * #11).
 *
 * ## Why this file RENDERS the message instead of reading the source text
 *
 * `DEBT` is `{}` in this tree, so the ratchet that emits this message cannot
 * fire here and the quotable string exists nowhere to be asserted against. A
 * source-text assertion is the precedent's answer and is kept below as the
 * cheap leg, but on its own it pins a template, not the sentence a contributor
 * would paste. So the harness copies the REAL gate into a throwaway tree with
 * the one thing that keeps it quiet — the empty `DEBT` — substituted, and reads
 * what the gate actually prints.
 *
 * ⚠️ Every leg here is paired with a control that MUST fire. A regex that
 * matches nothing renders exactly like a message that carries nothing, and a
 * substitution that silently matched no text renders exactly like a clean run.
 * Both are asserted rather than assumed.
