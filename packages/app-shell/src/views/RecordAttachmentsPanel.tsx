 * RecordAttachmentsPanel — generic record Attachments surface (#2727,

 *
 * Rendered by RecordDetailView ONLY when the object declares
 * `enable: { files: true }` (opt-in; the server rejects sys_attachment
 * rows targeting any other object with 403 FILES_DISABLED, so this panel
 * and the enforcement seam always agree).
 *
 * Storage model: one `sys_file` row per uploaded blob (three-step
 * presigned upload via @object-ui/providers' ObjectStack adapter), one
 * `sys_attachment` join row linking it to `(parent_object, parent_id)`.
 * Downloads fetch a short-lived signed URL from `/storage/files/:fileId/url`
 * with the console's Bearer token (the endpoint requires an authenticated
 * session for attachments-scope files, #2970), then open it.

 * What the panel actually KNOWS about this record's `sys_attachment` list
 * (#4684, #4693) — the five-way vocabulary the sibling surfaces settled on.
 *
 *   - `loading`         — the read is in flight (or has not been issued yet).
 *                         The panel knows nothing and asserts nothing.
 *   - `loaded`          — the read ANSWERED. Only in this state is
 *                         `rows.length` a fact about the record, and only
 *                         here may the panel say "No attachments yet".
 *   - `denied`          — refused for AUTHORIZATION reasons (#4269 / PR
 *                         #4685): 403 / `PERMISSION_DENIED` / `FORBIDDEN` /
 *                         an RLS denial. The caller may not look; the
 *                         record's contents are unknown.
 *   - `api-unavailable` — refused because the OBJECT withholds the API
 *                         entirely (#4693): `OBJECT_API_DISABLED` (404,
 *                         `enable.apiEnabled: false`) or
 *                         `OBJECT_API_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` (405, the
 *                         operation is absent from `enable.apiMethods`).
 *                         Both are pure functions of the object's metadata —
 *                         no user, no session, no request body — so unlike
 *                         `denied` this is not something any permission
 *                         grant fixes, and unlike `unavailable` below no
 *                         retry changes the answer either.
 *   - `unavailable`     — the read FAILED for any other reason: a network
 *                         failure (server unreachable, DNS, aborted
 *                         request), a 5xx, or a 401 / `AUTH_REQUIRED` (an
 *                         expired session is authentication, not
 *                         authorization, so the `denied` predicate
 *                         deliberately does not claim it). Also unknown, and
 *                         — unlike `api-unavailable` — genuinely retryable.
 *
 * The split that matters is assert-vs-don't-assert. Before #4684 `denied` and
 * `unavailable` both collapsed into `rows = []`, so a panel that never got an
 * answer told the user "No attachments yet. Upload a file to get started." —
 * an affirmative claim about the record's contents, made from no evidence,
 * over a record that may hold thousands. The house rule this restores landed
 * twice already as a bug fix: `HomeActionCenter` (#4235) may only say "You're
 * all caught up" once the inbox has answered, and an unloadable app list
 * (#4300) is UNKNOWN rather than "no default app".
 *
 * `api-unavailable` was split out of `unavailable` because the same
 * assert-vs-don't-assert reasoning applies to the AFFORDANCE, not just the
 * copy: `unavailable` offers a Retry because an outage or an expired session is
 * exactly what a second attempt can fix, but `OBJECT_API_DISABLED` /
 * `OBJECT_API_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` are retry-invariant — every retry of every
 * persona re-fetches the identical refusal, so the button was the same wrong
 * advice as "check your connection", just spelled as a control. Classified
 * with `classifyLoadError` (`@object-ui/react`), the same "is this
 * retry-invariant" verdict `ListView`'s error panel already renders for list
 * views — `classifyLoadError` was lifted out of `ListView.tsx`'s module scope
 * for exactly this reuse. `denied` and `unavailable` keep their pre-#4693
 * meaning (`isPermissionError`, unchanged) — `api-unavailable` is the one new
 * fork, checked before that split.

          Upload returns with the answer.

          `api-unavailable` withdraws it too (#4693), for a stronger reason
          than either: the object's `enable` block refuses this operation for

        answered before `rows.length === 0` is allowed to mean "the record
        holds nothing". `rows` is emptied on every failure, so any unknown
        state reaching the empty branch would render the exact lie these
        cards exist to remove.

        `status === 'loading' && rows.length === 0` (not `status === 'loading'`
        alone) is unchanged from the pre-#4684 shape: a refresh over an
        already-populated list keeps showing that list instead of blanking it
        to a spinner.
