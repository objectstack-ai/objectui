 * objectui#10183 — the `date` cell's overdue colouring takes its DAY from the
 * shared parse step, so a deadline falling today is not red west of UTC.
 *
 * ── What was measured ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The text half was already right: `DateCellRenderer` hands the raw value to
 * `formatDate`, which goes through `toDisplayDate` (objectui#10110). The red
 * half was not: `isOverdueInstant` was fed `new Date(safe)`, which for a
 * date-only value is UTC midnight, and compared it with the LOCAL start of
 * today. A due-type `2026-09-03` on the clock `2026-09-03T10:35Z` read `Today`
 * in every zone, and was `text-red-600` in `America/Los_Angeles` only.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ This file runs ONLY when driven, in a FORKS child ───────────────────
 * Every case below is skipped in the normal run. The zone is an input here,
 * and `process.env.TZ` written inside a test of the normal run does NOT move
 * it: the root config runs `pool: 'threads'`, a worker thread's `process.env`
 * is a plain copy with no native setter, and `Intl` keeps reading UTC — every
 * case would pass for the wrong reason. A forked worker is a real process's
 * MAIN thread, where Node's `TZ` setter does reset the zone.
 * `scripts/__tests__/date-only-zone-pins-10183.test.ts` spawns one vitest on
 * the forks pool over this file and its three siblings, and fails unless
 * every case here ran and passed. Each zone opens with a rig case — the zone
 * `Intl` resolved, and the local hour of a fixed INSTANT — so a child whose
 * zone did not move reds instead of going quietly green.
 *
 * `Asia/Shanghai` is the control: east of UTC the UTC-midnight parse already
 * landed on or after local midnight, and an hour-offset "repair" breaks it.
 * Yesterday's deadline is the second control: it must stay red in both zones,
 * so a repair that simply stopped colouring cannot pass either.
