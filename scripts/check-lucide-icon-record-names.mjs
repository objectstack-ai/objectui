/**
 * Every authored icon NAME that reaches a resolver reading lucide's runtime
 * `icons` record must be a live key of that record.
 *
 * ── The class this gate exists for ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * lucide retires a spelling by DROPPING IT FROM THE RUNTIME `icons` RECORD
 * while keeping it as a deprecated named export. A retired name therefore
 * still imports, still type-checks, and still renders wherever it is used as a
 * COMPONENT — and resolves to `null` wherever it is used as a STRING, because
 * the string lookups read that record. Nothing goes red in either direction:
 * not the compiler, not a render test that only looks at the label, not a
 * test that reaches for the export (`Edit === SquarePen` and
 * `Smile === FaceSlightlySmiling` are both TRUE — the retired alias is the
 * very same object under a dead name). MEMBERSHIP of the record is the only
 * thing that separates them.
 *
 * It had been repaired twice, in two packages, by two cards (objectui#5586,
 * objectui#5622), each leaving behind a LOCAL pin over the names that card
 * happened to touch. objectui#5633 asked for one gate over the population
 * instead of a fifth local pin.
 *
 * ── What judges ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The runtime `icons` record itself, loaded from the installed lucide, and
 * NOTHING ELSE. This gate deliberately carries no list of retired spellings:
 * a hand-kept vocabulary is the same defect one level up — it ages the moment
 * lucide retires the next name, and it ages SILENTLY. When it has to name a
 * replacement it derives one, by identity: the retired export and its live
 * spelling are the same object, so the live key is looked up in the record
 * rather than remembered.
 *
 * ── The two surfaces, and why picking the wrong one is worse than no gate ──
 * This repo resolves icon names against TWO different lucide vocabularies:
 *
 *   RECORD  — `icons` from 'lucide-react'            (1767 keys, measured)
 *   DYNAMIC — `iconNames` from 'lucide-react/dynamic.mjs' (2025 names)
 *
 * DYNAMIC is a strict superset: it still carries `edit`, `smile`, `filter`,
 * `alert-triangle`. So a gate that checked the dynamic list would BLESS every
 * name this class is about. Only names reaching a RECORD-reading resolver are
 * judged here; the dynamic sites are censused (below) precisely so that the
 * split stays declared and a site cannot move between surfaces unnoticed.
 *
 * ── HOW a site reaches DYNAMIC is also censused (objectui#9204) ─────────────
 * lucide derives `iconNames` as `Object.keys(dynamicIconImports)`, so importing
 * the names imports the dynamic-import map with them. Four modules did, and the
 * map — 8,253 B gzipped, measured — sat in the console's eager `ui-components`
 * chunk on every page load. All four are gone: two were transcriptions of
 * `getLazyIcon` and are now delegations, the icon picker asks
 * `@object-ui/components` for the vocabulary, and the one module left reaches
 * the map through `import()`.
 *
 * ⚠️ A GENERATED MIRROR OF THE NAMES IS NOT THE FIX, and the number is why: the
 * map's KEYS are the names, so a bare catalogue of them measured 9,176 B gzipped
 * spliced into that same chunk against the 8,253 B map it replaced (a
 * front-coded encoding probed and rejected at 8,397 B). The names left the eager
 * path by being ANSWERED FROM THE RECORD instead — the maintainer ruling of
 * 2026-09-13, which also retires the 254 spellings the two vocabularies disagree
 * about.
 *
 * That makes two spellings discovery has to see — a static import and an
 * `import()` — and gives this gate a second census:
 * `DECLARED_EAGER_DYNAMIC_IMPORTERS`, which is EMPTY. A static import restores
 * the map to the first payload while every other check stays green, because the
 * laziness lives in the source and the cost lives in a bundle. Here they meet.
 *
 * ── What it checks (three parts, each self-verifying) ───────────────────────
 * 1. SURFACE CENSUS — rediscovers, from source, every module that reads either
 *    vocabulary, and fails when the discovered set differs from the declared
 *    one. The population is measured on every run rather than remembered: this
 *    is what stops a ninth hand-copied resolver appearing in silence. Its first
 *    run found FOUR record-reading resolvers that objectui#5633's own table did
 *    not know about (`form/button.tsx`, `plugin-list/ListView.tsx`,
 *    `plugin-detail/RelatedList.tsx`, `previews/ActionPreview.tsx`).
 *
 * 2. AUTHORED NODES — walks authored SDUI metadata (JSON documents and the
 *    schema object literals embedded in first-party TS) and checks the `icon`
 *    names on nodes whose `type` is a censused record-reading renderer. The
 *    node's own `type` is what answers "which resolver does this string
 *    reach?", which is why this check can be broad without being suppressible.
 *
 *    An `icon` on an UNTYPED node is judged only when its NEAREST TYPED
 *    ANCESTOR is a censused container whose entry DECLARES that its child items
 *    carry icon names (`descendants: true`) — a fact read off that container's
 *    renderer, exactly the way every `paths` entry in the table below was. A
 *    typed node ENDS any descent it sits inside, because its own `type` is
 *    still the answer to which resolver its string reaches. Untyped icons under
 *    every other ancestor remain declined, not flagged.
 *
 *    ── Re-measured over the schema catalog at objectui@ef2a3bd8d ────────────
 *    The parenthetical this replaced read "the eight such names in the schema
 *    catalog are child items of `button-group`, `breadcrumb`, `command` and
 *    `dropdown-menu` — three of which never read `icon`, and the fourth renders
 *    it as raw text". objectui#5930 falsified its second half, and the count
 *    was low by 53. Re-measured, by reading each renderer (objectui#5992):
 *
 *      61 untyped `icon` names, across SEVEN containers. Exactly ONE of them
 *      reached a record-reading resolver AT THAT COMMIT — four do today, and
 *      each line below carries the card that moved it. A row's verdict is a
 *      fact about a renderer, so it expires when that renderer is repaired;
 *      "which containers reach the record" is re-read here, not remembered.
 *
 *        dropdown-menu   3  RECORD — `resolveIcon(item.icon)` in
 *                           `renderers/overlay/dropdown-menu.tsx` (objectui#5930).
 *                           JUDGED HERE. Judged RECURSIVELY, because that
 *                           renderer recurses into `item.children` for submenus
 *                           and resolves the submenu trigger's icon through the
 *                           same call — a depth no single-level `items[].icon`
 *                           path can express.
 *        button-group    8  `renderers/basic/button-group.tsx` never reads
 *                           `button.icon` at all; the names render nothing.
 *                           STILL TRUE at objectui#5931, and deliberately so:
 *                           `icon` is absent from `ButtonGroupButton` in
 *                           `packages/types` AND from its zod mirror, so
 *                           declaring it here would be censusing a key that is
 *                           not authorable. Routed for a decision, not guessed.
 *        breadcrumb      3  RECORD, since objectui#5931 — `resolveIcon(item.icon)`
 *                           in `renderers/data-display/breadcrumb.tsx`, resolved
 *                           once per item ABOVE the page/link split so BOTH arms
 *                           read it. JUDGED HERE.
 *        command         9  RECORD, since objectui#5931 — `resolveIcon(item.icon)`
 *                           in `renderers/form/command.tsx`. JUDGED HERE, and
 *                           necessarily by descent: the names sit at
 *                           `groups[].items[].icon`, a depth no single-level
 *                           `paths` entry can express.
 *        context-menu    4  RECORD, since objectui#6278 — dropdown-menu's twin,
 *                           and NOT routed by objectui#5930. JUDGED HERE.
 *        timeline        4  rendered as RAW TEXT, `<span>{item.icon}</span>`;
 *                           the four authored names are emoji, not lucide names
 *        tree-view      30  read, but as a TWO-VALUED literal switch
 *                           (`node.icon === 'folder'`) — never a record lookup
 *
 *    ── An EIGHTH container, added by objectui#6645 ─────────────────────────
 *    The row above is what this table's own rule predicts: a verdict is a fact
 *    about a renderer, so it expires when that renderer is repaired.
 *
 *        header-bar      3  RECORD, since objectui#6645 — `resolveIcon(crumb.icon)`
 *                           in `renderers/navigation/header-bar.tsx`, resolved
 *                           once per crumb ABOVE all three arms of its
 *                           `BreadcrumbLabel` helper. JUDGED HERE.
 *
 *    Until that repair this container reached NO resolver and declining its
 *    names was right — the same sequence `context-menu` went through in
 *    objectui#6278, and for the same reason: a census entry declares that a
 *    type's names REACH a vocabulary, and until the repair landed they reached
 *    nothing. ⚠️ It is NOT objectui#5992's blind spot, which is this gate
 *    GUESSING at containers nobody read off a renderer; this row was read off
 *    the renderer, like every other row here.
 *
 *    The three names are the ones `crumbs-with-icons.json` authors, which the
 *    same card added — before it the container authored none. Re-measured over
 *    `examples/schema-catalog/` with the walk described above: 64 untyped names
 *    across EIGHT containers, and the seven figures above re-measure
 *    IDENTICALLY (61 + 3). The scan-root figure below moves by the same 3.
 *
 *    `dropdown-menu.tsx` itself is correctly ABSENT from part 1's census: it
 *    imports `resolveIcon`, not `icons`, so the record read happens in
 *    `renderers/action/resolve-icon.ts`, which is already declared. That was a
 *    part-2 rule and not a census change — part 1 stood at eight resolvers when
 *    this paragraph was written, seven after objectui#5993, and ONE since
 *    objectui#5935 consolidated the remaining six onto the seam.
 *    `context-menu.tsx`, `breadcrumb.tsx` and `command.tsx` route the same way
 *    and are absent from part 1 for the same reason — part 1 knowing a MODULE
 *    and part 2 knowing a `type` are two independent facts.
 *
 *    ── Re-taken at objectui@e3784607f, and UNCHANGED ──────────────────────
 *    objectui#6009 censused the `icon` TYPE, which looks like it should move
 *    this table and does not: the table counts UNTYPED names, and a
 *    `type: 'icon'` node is typed, so the two populations are disjoint. The
 *    per-container figures above re-measure identically. Recorded rather than
 *    left implicit — "the numbers did not move" is a measurement, and the next
 *    reader should not have to re-derive that it was taken.
 *
 *    ⚠️ SCOPE, which the count above does not carry on its face: it is
 *    measured over `examples/schema-catalog/`, while this gate SCANS
 *    `packages/`, `apps/` and `examples/`. Over the full scan roots the same
 *    walk found 76 untyped names across NINE containers (79 across TEN since
 *    objectui#6645 — the same +3 in the same one container) — the extra 15 all in
 *    `packages/types/examples/` (`tree-view` +6, `timeline` +3, plus `list` 3
 *    and `sidebar` 3, two containers this table does not name at all). Both
 *    extra containers were read: `data-display/list.tsx` and
 *    `navigation/sidebar.tsx` never read `icon`, so those names reach no
 *    resolver and decline correctly. The table is right about what it judges;
 *    it is simply not the whole unjudged census.
 *
 * 3. ANCHORED MAPS — the first-party const maps that feed a record-reading
 *    resolver but are not authored nodes. This is the population the retired
 *    local pins covered, generalised: each anchor carries a minimum entry
 *    count, so a declaration that moved or was re-annotated fails LOUDLY
 *    instead of quietly extracting nothing and passing.
 *
 * ── Deliberate boundaries ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * - Test files are not scanned for authored nodes. Suites legitimately build
 *   fixtures out of names that must NOT resolve (`not-a-real-icon` is a
 *   control in two of them), and a gate that flagged its own controls gets
 *   suppressed.
 * - Imported lucide IDENTIFIERS are not checked repo-wide. 54 distinct retired
 *   identifiers are imported across ~350 sites and every one of them renders;
 *   flagging them would be a gate suppressed on day one. Identifiers ARE
 *   checked in the anchored icon maps of part 3, where a component map sits
 *   beside a string map that resolves the same glyphs and a dead spelling gets
 *   copied across — the exact path by which `bar-chart-3` and `gantt-chart`
 *   reached a string map (objectui#5586).
 * - A component REGISTRATION's `icon` meta is not judged, and this boundary is
 *   now CLOSED rather than open (objectui#5936). It is the palette-entry glyph
 *   on `ComponentRegistry.register(..., { icon })` — 45 registrations declare
 *   one. It was left unjudged at objectui#5633 because nothing could be found
 *   reading it, and objectui#5936 was filed to locate that reader before the
 *   gate was extended to the population. THE READER WAS NOT FOUND, in any of
 *   the three first-party populations anyone has:
 *
 *     objectui     zero  — filing seat, 2026-08-24; RE-DERIVED at objectui@24e027e93
 *                          over all five meta-bearing registry read paths, not
 *                          just `getMeta(...).icon`. `getMeta()` has four
 *                          first-party callers and they read `.labelling`,
 *                          `.namespace`, `.isContainer`, `.inputs` and
 *                          `.deprecated`; `getPublicConfigs()` has one, reading
 *                          `{ type, isContainer }`; `getConfig()`,
 *                          `getAllConfigs()` and `getNamespaceComponents()`
 *                          have none. Controls fired on the same tree: 51
 *                          `getMeta(` occurrences, 4898 `-i icon` lines.
 *     objectstack  zero  — PM seat, origin/main @ daacc1071, 2026-08-24.
 *     cloud        zero  — `repo:cloud` seat, cloud@9b6abe0f2fd5, 2026-09-03
 *                          (objectstack#12931). Structural, not just grep-deep:
 *                          cloud has NO component-registration surface at all
 *                          and no `@object-ui/*` dependency in any of its 19
 *                          package.json files. Controls fired: `getMeta` without
 *                          the paren 276, `-i icon` 412.
 *
 *   ⇒ ADJUDICATED 2026-09-04: the gate is NOT extended to registration `icon`
 *   meta. Both branches objectui#5936 offered — a record-reading consumer, or a
 *   dynamic-surface one — are NOT OBSERVED, so there is nothing to tell this
 *   gate which vocabulary such a name would reach. Judging it anyway would be
 *   this file's own cardinal error: guessing a vocabulary. ⛔ Do not re-open on
 *   the strength of the local `ui:icon` pin — that pin was the reason to go
 *   looking, not evidence of what was found, and objectui#5936 retired its
 *   membership half for exactly this reason.
 *
 *   ⚠️ Three zeros close the three KNOWN populations; they are NOT a proof of
 *   absence. A customer-authored app or an unmeasured repo could read the meta,
 *   and `WidgetRegistry` copies `manifest.icon` INTO this meta from external
 *   widget manifests — a first-party producer path whose consumer is expected
 *   to be a designer palette outside this tree. So: measured dead here, not
 *   proven dead anywhere. NEW EVIDENCE — an actual reader, in any repo — is
 *   what re-opens this, and it re-opens it as a real extension.
 *
 * Run:     node scripts/check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs
 *          node scripts/check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs --report
 * Exit:    0 = OK, 1 = a violation, a census drift, or a blind instrument

// fail the gate. Add a new resolver here only after deciding which vocabulary
// it reads — that decision is the whole point of the split.
//
// ⭐ ONE ENTRY, since objectui#5935. This list carried SEVEN modules, each with
// its own hand-rolled lookup: three different tokenisers (`split('-')` on five
// of them, `split(/[-_\s]/)` on one, `split(/[-_\s]+/)` on one) and the
// `Home -> House` rename on only four — so the same authored name rendered on
// one surface and not another. All six non-seam sites now import `resolveIcon`
// from `renderers/action/resolve-icon.ts`, which is why they left this census
// in the same commit, exactly as `renderers/form/button.tsx` did at
// objectui#5993.
//
// ⛔ This list is also the ENFORCEMENT of ruling point 4 of 2026-08-31
// (objectui#5935 comment 5472612351, verbatim 「同意」):
// 「本裁定后新容器 ⛔ 不得再自带解析器,一律走 seam」. Discovery is re-run from
// source on every run and disagreement fails in BOTH directions, so WITHIN THE
// BOUND BELOW the note is mechanical rather than a request in a review
// checklist.
//
// ⚠️ THE BOUND, spelled out because this comment used to over-claim it (PR
// #7491's contract review measured the over-claim). `discoverResolvers` holds
// exactly one syntactic predicate:
//
//     a NAMED import of `icons` from 'lucide-react' — a rename such as
//     `{ icons as reg }` still counts — AND an ELEMENT ACCESS whose base is
//     that local binding, seen through parentheses, `as` casts and `!`.
//
// Measured RED against this gate: `icons[k]`; a renamed binding indexed;
// `(icons as Record<string, X>)[k]`; and any argument expression at all,
// a template literal included — the predicate never looks at the argument.
// Measured GREEN, i.e. OUTSIDE the predicate and NOT caught:
//
//   - a namespace import — `import * as L from 'lucide-react'; L.icons[k]`;
//   - a named import RE-BOUND through another const — `const t = icons; t[k]`;
//   - property access rather than element access — `icons.House`;
//   - destructuring — `const { House } = icons`;
//   - `require()` and dynamic `import()` of the module;
//   - anything inside a string or TEMPLATE LITERAL, which is emitted code and
//     not executed code in the file that holds it.
//
// objectui#7472 is the known resolver outside this predicate, and outside it
// three ways at once: `packages/cli/src/utils/app-generator.ts` emits, INSIDE a
// template literal, `import * as LucideIcons from 'lucide-react'` re-bound to a
// `lucideIcons` const and then indexed. Its absence from this list is CORRECT
// rather than a miss — it reads lucide's named-export namespace, not the
// runtime record, with no normalisation at all — and widening discovery to see
// it is a separate design question with a real false-positive cost, ⛔ not
// decided here and not asked for by that card.
//
// So, precisely: a new container that hand-rolls a lookup IN THE CONFORMING
// SHAPE turns this gate red on the commit that adds it. One written any of the
// other ways does not, and the ruling still binds it — that half is held by
// review, not by this file. The lawful way to add an icon-rendering container
// is to call the seam; adding a path here instead re-opens the divergence this
// card closed and needs a ruling.

/**
 * `resolver` is the string printed as `Resolved through: ...` beside a
 * violation. Until objectui#7492 NOTHING judged it: it could name a module with
 * no lookup in it, or a file that does not exist, and this gate stayed green.
 * That is a declaration naming a module which does not do the declared thing —
 * the very class this gate exists to end, one level up, in its own tooling.
 * (`data-table` was that entry: it named its RENDERER, which routes through the
 * seam, so the string sent whoever was chasing a violation to a file with
 * nothing in it to find.)
 *
 * Two halves, and neither invents a vocabulary — both are derived from what the
 * gate already measures:
 *
 *  1. The part BEFORE `(via ...)` names the module whose lookup those names
 *     reach, so it must be one of the record-reading resolvers part 1
 *     rediscovers FROM SOURCE on every run. A router's own file can therefore
 *     only appear after `(via `, which is what makes the two-part form its
 *     siblings use the one shape a routed entry can take. Existence comes with
 *     it: part 1 fails on a declared reader it cannot rediscover.
 *  2. The part INSIDE `(via ...)` is a real path, spelled relative to one of the
 *     ANCESTOR directories of that reader (`renderers/form/button.tsx` against
 *     `packages/components/src/`, `plugin-view/src/ViewSwitcher.tsx` against
 *     `packages/`) — so the roots to try are read off the reader rather than
 *     listed here. A renamed or moved renderer otherwise leaves a string that
 *     reads perfectly and points nowhere.
 *
 * ⛔ `analyze`'s `recordReadingTypes` / `declaredRecordReaders` overrides are
 * deliberately NOT forwarded to this check: it judges the declarations THIS FILE
 * ships, exactly as `selfTest()` judges the lucide install rather than the tree
 * under analysis. A fixture substituting a two-row table and a fake reader path
 * would otherwise fail over strings it never chose.

// was the WIDEST of the three tokenisers in the tree plus the rename map that
// only four of seven sites carried, chosen so the gate could never invent a
// violation some resolver would not have produced — at the cost, disclosed in
// PR #5932 and carried by this card, of UNDER-REPORTING precisely where the
// resolvers disagreed. With one resolver left there is nothing to approximate:
// this IS the normalisation, so a name judged dead here is dead everywhere and
// the blind spot is closed rather than bounded.
//
// `.filter(Boolean)` is retained and is INERT — capitalising the empty string
// yields the empty string and joining it contributes nothing (measured over
// 51,449 hostile spellings: zero mismatches with and without). It is kept
// because removing it would be an unmeasured edit to a gate's own predicate.
//
// ⚠️ Two copies of one rule, unavoidably: the resolver is TypeScript inside a
// package and this gate is a standalone `.mjs` that must run without a build.
// `scripts/__tests__/check-lucide-icon-record-names.test.ts` holds them
// together, and since PR #7491's contract review it does so BEHAVIOURALLY: it
// imports `describeIconLookup` from the resolver and asserts
// `toRecordKey(s) === describeIconLookup(s).key` over every live key re-spelled
// six ways plus a per-character separator sweep, with its own control that the
// corpus can in fact separate the two.
//
// ⛔ The source-text rows that file also keeps are NOT that guarantee, and the
// difference was measured rather than argued: widening ONLY this side to
// `/[-_.\s]+/` left the whole suite green, 40/40, because the resolver's text
// was untouched and every source-text assertion still held. Which is why "a
// change to either side that is not made to the other fails loudly" is now
