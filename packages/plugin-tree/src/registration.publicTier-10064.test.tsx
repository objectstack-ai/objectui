 * objectui#10064 — `object-tree` is on the curated PUBLIC tier (ADR-0080).
 *
 * ## What was wrong, stated as the direction it was wrong in
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` DECLARES this block: `object-tree` is a key of
 * `ComponentPropsMap`. This repo registered the renderer (twice — see the alias
 * pin below) and curated neither spelling, so `getPublicConfigs()` — the read
 * both manifest producers serialize — could not report a block the contract
 * says exists. The public tier was NARROWER than the declaration, and every
 * downstream artefact faithfully reported that: regenerating
 * `sdui.manifest.json` upstream was a byte-identical no-op and moving the
 * objectui pin could not help, because the pinned source had nothing to carry.
 *
 * ⇒ this pin is over the ADMISSION, and it fails by ABSENCE.
 *
 * ## The instrument, and the lit control in the same test
 *
 * Every assertion below reads `getPublicConfigs()` / `PUBLIC_BLOCKS` — the same
 * public path `apps/console/dev/manifest-dump.tsx` and the framework's
 * `gen-sdui-manifest-node.mjs` both serialize through `manifestFromConfigs`.
 * `object-grid` is asserted beside `object-tree` every time, so a zero for the
 * tree is an absence this instrument could have seen: a lookup that has stopped
 * reaching the curated roster reports BOTH missing and fails on the control
 * first, rather than reading as a finding about the tree (objectui#8410).
 *
 * ## Which mechanism, and why not the other one
 *
 * `getPublicConfigs()` admits a block by TWO routes: membership of the curated
 * `PUBLIC_BLOCKS` roster, or `tier: 'public'` on the registration itself. The
 * siblings settle it — `object-grid`, `object-map`, `object-gantt` and every
 * other view block reach the tier through the roster, and NO registration in
 * this repo's published source declares `tier: 'public'`. So the admission is a
 * roster entry, ⛔ not a flag here, and ⛔ not both: two mechanisms for one
 * block is the ambiguity `public-blocks.ts` asks callers to avoid in its own
 * words ("prefer editing this list over scattering `tier` flags").
