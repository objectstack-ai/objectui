/**
 * objectui#4463 — "Set as Default" was dead on every saved view, and drag-reorder
 * with it, because the adapter method was called **unbound**.
 *
 * Both `handleSetDefaultView` and `handleReorderViews` detached the method into a
 * local first and then called the bare reference:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const updateView = (dataSource as any).updateView;   // detached here
 * …
 * updateView(objectName, target, patch);               // `this` === undefined
 * ```
 *
 * `ObjectStackAdapter.updateView` opens with `await this.connect()`, so every
 * write in the list rejected with
 * `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'connect')` **before a
 * single request went out** — QA measured zero network requests, one console
 * error and a toast. The sibling `handlePinView` called the same method as a
 * method and worked, which is why rename and pin passed in the same menu while
 * set-default did not.
 *
 * WHY A CLASS-BASED ADAPTER IS LOAD-BEARING HERE. A plain `vi.fn()` spy has no
 * `this` to lose, so it answers identically bound or unbound: a test built on one
 * is green against the defect and pins nothing. The fake below therefore
 * reproduces the one property that makes the bug observable — its `updateView`
 * dereferences `this` on its first statement, exactly as the real adapter does.
 * {@link describe} block "the fake reds when the method is detached" is the
 * control that proves it: it restores the detached call shape and asserts the
 * verbatim TypeError, so the green assertions below cannot be vacuously green.
 *
 * Reverse verification (direction predicted before running, and it holds):
 * restoring `const updateView = (dataSource as any).updateView` inside
 * {@link dispatchViewPatches} turns the set-default and reorder blocks RED with
 * that same TypeError, while the control block stays green — it pins the failure
 * mode itself, which this change does not move.
