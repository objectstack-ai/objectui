/**
 * Rich-text (WYSIWYG) field metadata — the THIRD registry key `RichTextField`

 *
 * `markdown`, `html` and `richtext` are ONE widget (objectui#5498). The first
 * two carried an exported metadata type; `richtext` carried none, so the only
 * way to write a richtext field's metadata was
 * `as unknown as MarkdownFieldMetadata` — a deliberate cast whose presence in
 * `RichTextField.rows.test.tsx` was the gap's only evidence. Neither a member
 * nor a recorded alias: a silent hole that had to be rediscovered to be seen.
 * Closed by the maintainer's objectui#7083 ruling (decision batch #71,
 * 2026-09-07), which is why the cast and its comment are gone as well.
 *
 * ## The read set below is DERIVED, not copied from the siblings
 *
 * Read off `RichTextField.tsx` on the `richtext` path, key by key:
 *
 *  - `type` — `resolveRichTextFieldType` reads `field.type` (stripping a
 *    `field:` prefix). It is THE discriminator for the three keys, and the
 *    ONLY thing that differs between them at runtime: it selects the display
 *    pipeline (`richtext` reads through the HTML renderer, objectui#5452) and
 *    the editor's format label. Nothing else in the widget branches on it.
 *  - `rows` — `richField?.rows || 8`, the inline editor's height. Declared
 *    here for the same reason objectui#6140 declared it on the two siblings:
 *    the running widget honoured a key an annotated literal rejected.
 *  - `mobile_fullscreen`, `placeholder`, `label` — also read off this carrier
 *    (the expand affordance, the textarea placeholder, the dialog title), and
 *    all three already sit on {@link BaseFieldMetadata}, so they need no
 *    redeclaration here. Listed because "derived" has to name what it found,
 *    including the keys that turned out to need no line.
 *
 * The readonly branch hands `field` whole to the `RICH_TEXT_CELL_RENDERERS`
 * entry for the type; both renderers there destructure `value` only, so the
 * display half contributes no metadata key.
 *
 * ## `max_length` — read at SUBMIT, not by the widget
 *
 * `RichTextField` never reads this key. It is declared because a live reader
 * outside the widget does, on every field regardless of type:
 * `buildValidationRules` (`packages/fields/src/index.tsx`) compiles
 * `(field as any).maxLength ?? field.max_length` into a react-hook-form
 * `maxLength` rule. That function is GENERIC — it has no field-type gate
 * anywhere in it — and both form producers call it on every field they build
 * (`ObjectForm`'s `validation: buildValidationRules(field)` and the same line
 * in `sectionFields.ts`); the form renderer spreads the result into the RHF
 * `rules` object and localizes the `maxLength` entry. ⇒ `max_length` written
 * on a `richtext` field IS enforced when the form is submitted. That is the
 * checkable reason this key is declared.
 *
 * ⛔ Spec symmetry is NOT that reason, and must not be restated as one. At
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 `FieldSchema` answers identically for EVERY field
 * type — `text` included — on `maxLength` (admitted) and on the legacy
 * snake_case `max_length` (refused BY NAME), so that reading is
 * non-discriminating here: it says nothing about `richtext` versus its two
 * siblings. It is still pinned, for the three types this widget serves, in
 * `packages/fields/src/widgets/__tests__/richtext-field-metadata-7083.test.tsx`
 * — the `maxLength` admitted and `max_length` refused halves. `rows` admitted
 * is pinned separately, in
 * `packages/types/src/__tests__/select-option-spec-extension-7014.test.ts`.
 *
 * ⚠️ The two form-side sites this docblock used to name as not reaching
 * `richtext` were RE-MEASURED by objectui#8438, and the reading did not hold:
 * `ObjectForm`'s `text | textarea | markdown | html` list writes
 * `formField.maxLength`, which no registered widget reads (the carrier is
 * `formField.field`), so it forwarded the cap for NONE of its four types; and
 * `EmbeddableForm`'s `DEFAULT_MAX_LENGTH` did deliver 5000 for `markdown` and
 * `html`, where `RichTextField` then dropped it unread. ⇒ the cap was invisible
 * for all three of this widget's registry keys, not for `richtext` alone.
 * objectui#8438 fixed it where it was actually lost — `RichTextField` now
 * dual-reads `maxLength ?? max_length` — so a `max_length` authored here is
 * honoured by the native stop, the character counter and `aria-describedby`,
 * as well as at submit.
 *
 * Omitting the key would have left `richtext` the one type of the three whose
 * ceiling cannot be authored under an annotation, while the submit-time rule
 * that enforces it stayed live — a fresh instance of the asymmetry this member
 * exists to end.
 *
 * ⚠️ The `rows` docblocks on the two siblings still describe the
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0 boundary, where `rows` was refused by name. That
 * prose is objectui#7635's declared surface, not this member's; the 17.3.0
 * reading above is stated for `richtext` only and is not a correction of it.

/**
 * Object document type — derived from `@objectstack/spec/data` rather than
 * restated (objectui#5362; maintainer ruling 2026-08-20: the object document
 * type belongs to `@objectstack/spec`, objectui derives rather than
 * hand-copies — the same layer split objectui#3074 applied to
 * `PageNodeSchema` and objectstack#4115 applied to `ObjectIndex` below).
 *
 * The hand-written interface this replaces had drifted in both directions:
 *
 * - It declared NONE of `titleFormat`, `listViews`, `icon` — three keys the
 *   shipped runtime reads (objectui#5362 lists the read sites), so a document
 *   annotated with this type got excess-property errors on keys the renderer
 *   then happily consumed.
 * - It declared nine members no objectui runtime code reads and the spec's
 *   object document does not know: `extends`, `triggers`, `primary_key`,
 *   `relationships`, `name_field` (the spec key is `nameField`),
 *   `soft_delete`, `audit_trail`, `version`, `cache`.
 *
 * Spelling (objectui#5362): the spec declares only camelCase `listViews`;
 * `list_views` appears nowhere in `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0's `dist/`. The
 * runtime keeps a snake-spelling READ fallback for stored app data published
 * before this settlement (that stock has never been censused —
 * objectstack#7917); the tolerance lives at the read sites, deliberately not
 * in this type: new documents must author `listViews`.
 *
 * `ServiceObject` is the AUTHORING shape (`z.input` — pre-parse, defaults
 * not yet applied), which is what a hand-authored or served object document
 * is before validation. The post-parse shape is the spec's
 * `ServiceObjectParsed`.
 */

/**
 * Client-side members the objectui runtime reads on the object document but
 * `@objectstack/spec` does not declare. Every member here must cite a live
 * runtime read — this type is the measured client DELTA on top of the spec
 * document, not a place to restate spec keys (restating them would recreate
 * the hand-written fork objectui#5362 retired). The member list is pinned by
 * `__tests__/object-schema-metadata-spec-derivation.test.ts`, so growing it is
 * a conscious decision: promote the key upstream to the spec, or add it here
 * with the runtime read that justifies it.
 *
 * ## The delta is EMPTY today, and that is the pinned state
 *
 * `editMode` was the one member. `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 ADOPTED it —
 * measured on the installed build, `ObjectSchema`'s accept set went 42 → 43
 * keys with gained set exactly `['editMode']` and an empty lost set, declared
 * as `editMode?: 'page' | 'modal'`, the same union this file carried. So the
 * key is no longer a client delta, and restating it here would be exactly the
 * fork this type exists to prevent: two declarations of one key, with the
 * local one shadowing the spec's for every reader.
 *
 * The retirement is what the pin's own docblock PRESCRIBED for this event
 * ("If the spec ever adopts `editMode`, this test and the absence test above
 * both flip — retire the extension member and let the derivation carry the
 * key"), so it is executing a standing instruction, not a new decision.
 *
 * ⚠️ Nothing about `editMode` is removed from the product: it stays authorable
 * and stays typed on {@link ObjectSchemaMetadata}, now carried by
 * `ServiceObject`. `app-shell`'s `utils/recordFormNavigation.ts` read is
 * unchanged. What DID change is that a published, spec-validated object
 * document may now carry it — at 17.2.0 the spec refused the key by name.
 *
 * The type is kept (rather than deleted) because it is exported from
 * `@object-ui/types` and because the derivation `spec type + client delta` is
 * the shape this package pins; an empty delta states "objectui adds nothing
 * here today", which is a fact worth keeping addressable. `Record<never,
 * never>` rather than `{}`: `keyof` answers `never`, and it does not trip
 * `@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type`.
