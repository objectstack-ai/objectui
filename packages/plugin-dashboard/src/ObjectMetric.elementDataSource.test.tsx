 *
 * `object-metric` consumes `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` (objectstack#6953).
 *
 * This widget is registered directly and takes `objectName` / `filter` as PROPS
 * (`SchemaRenderer` spreads the schema's own keys onto it), so the spec's
 * per-element binding had no path in at all. Its no-object branch is the reason
 * the gap is worth a pin: with no `objectName` the widget does not error, it
 * renders its STATIC fallback value — a number that looks real and answers
 * nothing.
 *
 * `object` and `filter` are the only mapped keys: a metric is one aggregated
 * number, so there is no projection, no ordering and no page for the binding's
 * remaining keys to act on.
 *
 * ## Promoted to the member pin for `object-metric.dataSource` (objectui#8071)
 *
 * objectui#8071's eighth slice registers this file as the pin for that key. The
 * member set it asserts is a WHITELIST in both directions: `object` and `view`
 * are the members that act — the bound object is what gets aggregated and the
 * named view's own `filter` becomes the metric's scope — while the view's
 * `columns`, `sort` and `pagination` are carried in the fixture and asserted
 * ABSENT from the call, because `OBJECT_METRIC_DATA_SOURCE` names only
 * `filter`. Without that second direction the pin would be satisfied by a
 * mapping that forwarded everything, which for this block would mean a metric
 * silently ordered and paged by a list view's presentation settings.
