/**
 * approverIdentity — the ONE place the console turns an approver REFERENCE
 * into something a person can read (`77f846a8b`).
 *
 * ## The defect this closes
 *
 * `sys_approval_request.pending_approvers` carries the engine's own vocabulary:
 * `<kind>:<value>` references (`position:sales_manager`, `department:<id>`, …),
 * the portable indirect bindings ADR-0090 D3 leads with. The record page's
 * approval panel ran every entry through `formatIdentity`, which knew `role:`
 * and email addresses and otherwise MIDDLE-TRUNCATED anything over 14
 * characters. `position:sales_manager` is 22, so the one line answering *who is
 * holding this record* rendered as
 *
 *     positi…ager
 *
 * — an internal identifier, and not even a complete one. The same string
 * reached the admin-override confirm dialog un-truncated (`bypassedApproverNames`
 * defaults its formatter to identity), so a dialog that explains a subtle
 * governance concept in plain prose named the bypassed party as
 * `position:sales_manager`.
 *
 * ## What replaces it
 *
 * Three tiers, most authoritative first — the first that answers wins:
 *
 *   1. **The server's own resolution.** `pending_approver_names[ref]` is the
 *      producer's id -> name mapping. When it answers, nothing here fires and no
 *      request is made. This module never overrides it.
 *   2. **The directory record.** A ref whose kind the spec declares as
 *      `source: 'data'` names a row in a system directory object
 *      ({@link APPROVER_DIRECTORY_BINDINGS}); its display column is the label a
 *      person recognizes (`sys_position.label` -> `Sales Manager` / `销售经理`).
 *      `useApproverDirectory` fetches those; this module only composes them.
 *   3. **The machine name, prettified.** With no adapter and no directory row,
 *      `sales_manager` -> `Sales Manager` still beats `positi…ager`, and it is
 *      derived rather than guessed.
 *
 * The raw reference is never lost — every caller keeps it as the element's
 * `title`, which is where the card says an internal identifier belongs.
 *
 * ## Why staffing is tri-state, and why that is load-bearing
 *
 * "Nobody currently holds this position" is a REAL state and the motivating
 * rescue case for the admin-override path (framework#3424) — a request routed
 * to an unstaffed seat. `销售经理(暂无在岗人员)` is actionable; `positi…ager` is
 * not. But "the staffing query failed / was never run" is a different claim
 * from "the seat is empty", and rendering the first as the second would put a
 * fabricated fact on a governance surface. So {@link ResolvedApprover.holders}
 * is `undefined` (unknown — say nothing) / `[]` (probed, confirmed empty) /
 * a non-empty list, and {@link approverDisplay} only ever reports an empty seat
 * for the middle case. Same asymmetry, same reason, as `isViaOverrideRow` in
 * `approvalOverride.ts`.
