/**
 * objectui#9651, end to end — the seam a primitive-only pin cannot reach.
 *
 * `ViewColumnInspector` builds its field roster from `useObjectFields`, which
 * has published THREE facts all along: `fields`, `loading` and `error`. Only the
 * first two were passed on. So a `client.get` that REJECTED left the picker with
 * an empty roster and nothing in flight — the same residue an object with no
 * fields leaves — and a column bound to a real field rendered
 * `amount (not in object)` from then on, with nothing on screen saying the
 * request had failed. Unlike the in-flight window objectui#8862 closed, this one
 * never ends.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Why the whole chain is mounted instead of the primitive alone
 *
 * `_shared.rosterFailure.test.tsx` pins what the primitive does when it is TOLD
 * the roster failed. That leaves the seam this suite exists for: whether this
 * call site actually passes the fact its hook already publishes. A primitive
 * fixed with the prop unthreaded here is green there and still ships the defect
 * — which is exactly how the `error` channel came to be dropped in the first
 * place.
 *
 * ## The three arms, with their controls, in one instrument
 *
 *   • in flight   → no flag (objectui#8862's delivery, and the control that it
 *                   still works)
 *   • answered, value genuinely absent → flag (the control that the flag still
 *                   fires when it should)
 *   • FAILED      → no flag, plus a notice naming the cause (the subject)
 *
 * ⚠️ The measured pre-fix reading of the third arm was `amount (not in object)`
 * with zero elements carrying `role="status"` anywhere in the tree.
