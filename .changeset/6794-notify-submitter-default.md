'@object-ui/app-shell': patch

The flow-node inspector now declares the spec's default for
`escalation.notifySubmitter` (objectui#6794).

`FLOW_NODE_CONFIG`'s approval group declared **no `defaultValue`** for
`escalation.notifySubmitter`, while the installed `@objectstack/spec` (17.2.0)
defaults the key to `true` — `ApprovalEscalationSchema.safeParse({ timeoutHours: 24 })`
returns `notifySubmitter: true`. So the hand-written table stated the opposite of
what an omitted key does at runtime, and it disagreed with the **online half of
the same form**: a backend that publishes the approval `configSchema` sends
`default: true`, which `json-schema-to-fields` turns into `defaultValue: 'true'`.
Offline and online rendered the same key from two different claims about the
spec.

`defaultValue` is what `isFieldVisible` resolves an unset controller against, so
the missing declaration is what a future field gating on `notifySubmitter` would
have read — and it is what the table asserts about the contract to anyone reading
it.

A reconciliation assertion in `flow-node-config.spec-reconciliation.test.ts`
keeps the two sides pinned. It reads the expected value **out of the installed
spec** rather than pinning the literal `'true'`: objectui is the consumer of that
contract and must not become a second source of truth for it. A vacuity guard
alongside it fails if the spec ever stops materialising the key at all, so the
comparison can never quietly become a comparison against `undefined`.

Deliberately scoped to `notifySubmitter`. The sibling controller
`escalation.enabled` is a separate card (objectui#6620) whose default flipped on
a spec bump that has since landed — installed `@objectstack/spec` 17.4.0 returns
`enabled: true`, and PR objectui#8615 has matched the table's declaration to it,
so installed spec and table agree on it today. When this was written that bump
was still ahead, and generalising this assertion across the block would have
armed that card's tripwire here.
