/**
 * Build-time guard: `@objectstack/lint` must stay OUT of the eager closure.
 *
 * `packages/app-shell/src/preview/capabilityLint.ts` reaches the linter through
 * a deliberate `await import('@objectstack/lint')` — it runs only when an
 * author publishes in the metadata designer. That laziness is worth ~89 KiB
 * gzipped on every console page load, and it is defeated silently: an
 * `advancedChunks` group whose `test` matches the linter overrides the
 * module's async-only reachability and folds it in beside the synchronously
 * reached `@objectstack/spec`, whose chunk the entry imports STATICALLY
 * (objectui#5266). Nothing about the source changes, no warning is emitted,
 * and the existing bundle budget cannot see it — that budget weighs the
 * `index-*.js` entry chunk alone, and these bytes land in a vendor chunk.
 *
 * So the invariant is asserted where it is decided, on the emitted graph, in
 * the spirit of `viteMaplibreWorker` above: a regression must fail the BUILD
 * rather than ship an extra half-megabyte only a profiler would find.
 *
 * The check is deliberately two-part. Asserting "no eager chunk holds the
 * linter" alone would also pass if the walk found nothing at all — a green
 * check with no subject. The counter-probe runs first and demands a KNOWN
 * eager `@objectstack/spec`, so the linter verdict is only ever read after the
 * closure walk has proven it can see the very chunk the linter used to hide in.
 *
 * That makes both module-id tests SUBJECTS of the check, not decoration, and
 * neither may be hardcoded here. `OBJECTSTACK_SPEC_DIST` rewrites all 18
 * `@objectstack/spec` specifiers to absolute paths in the overriding tree —
 * `/…/objectstack/packages/spec/dist/…/index.mjs`, ids with no
 * `@objectstack` segment at all — so a private `/@objectstack[\\/+]spec/`
 * matched zero modules, this counter-probe correctly refused a verdict, and it
 * took every injected build down with it (objectui#5388; measured from the
 * consumer side in objectstack#10136, where it blocked the framework's Console
 * Pin Gate). The spec test is therefore a PARAMETER, fed from the same
 * `resolveSpecDistInjection` output the `vendor-objectstack` group already
 * reads: one producer, both consumers, no second opinion about where the spec
 * lives.
 *
 * `LINT` stays literal — nothing injects `@objectstack/lint` today — but it gets
 * its own counter-probe for the same reason, because its failure mode is the
 * worse one. The spec test going blind fails LOUD (this build stops). The lint
 * test going blind fails SILENT: the assertion below is negative, so zero
 * matches reads exactly like a clean bundle and the guard is green forever.
 * objectstack#9659 proposes injecting four more `@objectstack/*` packages the
 * same way and lint is a plausible member; if it ever joins, this build says so
 * instead of quietly ceasing to guard anything.

/**
 * Emits the eager-closure size report the console performance budget weighs.
 *
 * The budget in `.github/workflows/performance-budget.yml` used to gzip one
 * file — the `index-*.js` entry chunk — and call the result "the console
 * performance budget". Measured on `77f846a8b` that chunk is 25.3 KB gzipped
 * against a 350 KB line, while the closure the browser must fetch and parse
 * before the app renders is 3,791 KB across 58 chunks. The gate therefore
 * passed on 0.67% of the payload it claimed to govern, and the 89 KiB
 * regression of objectui#5266 landed in `vendor-objectstack-*.js` where it was
 * structurally invisible (objectui#5324).
 *
 * What the page pays for is the EAGER CLOSURE: every chunk reachable from an
 * entry chunk through STATIC imports only. `dynamicImports` is deliberately not
 * followed — that edge is the lazy boundary, and following it would turn this
 * number into "the whole bundle", which no page load pays.
 *
 * This plugin only MEASURES. The ceiling and the verdict live in
 * `scripts/check-eager-closure-budget.mjs`, which the workflow runs against the
 * report written here. The split is deliberate: a size ceiling that fails
 * `vite build` would also fail every Vercel preview deploy and every local
 * build, which is how a budget gets switched off. The graph knowledge stays
 * here, where rolldown's own `chunk.imports` is authoritative; the policy stays
 * in a file with unit tests.
 *
 * The report is written INTO `dist` on purpose. A report that outlives its
 * build is worse than no report — `rm -rf dist` followed by a stale read is a
 * verdict about a bundle that no longer exists. Living in the output directory
 * makes the report and the bundle the same artifact. It carries only chunk file
 * names and byte counts, all of which are already observable in the deployed
 * bundle itself.
 *
 * Both counter-probes below refuse a verdict rather than report a number that
 * happens to be small, in the spirit of `assertLazyLinterStaysLazy` above:
 * an under-counting walk is the dangerous direction, because the budget's
 * failure mode is silent — a closure walk that finds nothing reads exactly like
 * a bundle that got smaller.

            // came from `core|react|types` — its own test:

            //   | packages/react            |  63 mod |  4.7% |
            //   | packages/data-objectstack |   5 mod |  4.6% |
            //   | packages/types            |  15 mod |  2.3% |
            //
            // `framework`'s regex does not match EITHER of the two intruders, and
            // `data-adapter` — declared below since objectui#5490 — emitted no
            // chunk at all. On a tie the subgraph reached through
            // `@object-ui/react` was absorbed by the group listed first, so
            // `PER_CHUNK_GZIP_CEILINGS['framework']` was in operation a budget on
            // the TRANSLATION CATALOGUE: 523,959 gzipped bytes against a 524,000
            // ceiling, 41 bytes of headroom for the whole repository, and a gate
            // whose message ("don't grow core|react|types") pointed away from its
            // own cause. Five PRs adding ruled user-facing copy were parked on it.
            //
            // So the two groups the tie was swallowing are lifted one tier ABOVE
            // it, and `i18n` leaves `infrastructure`'s alternation because a
            // dedicated group now owns it (a dead alternative in a live regex is
            // the next silent drift). Tier 84 sits above the general workspace
            // groups and below the vendor tier at 85+; its two members' tests are
            // disjoint from each other and from every vendor test, so lifting
            // them introduces no new tie.
            //
            // ⛔ This moves NO MODULE BYTES. The eager closure holds the same
            // module set before and after; what changes is which file each
            // module is written to. Measured cost of the extra chunk
            // boundaries: eager closure 3,255,233 -> 3,256,012 gzipped, +779 B
            // (+0.024%), raw +837 B — all of it `import` bookkeeping in the
            // chunks that now name two files where they named one. Nothing here
            // may be read as headroom that was earned.

            // ⚠️ Disclosed rather than smoothed over: `data-adapter` now also

            // without re-absorbing the catalogue, which is the whole defect.
            //
            // ## Why there are ELEVEN i18n groups and not one (objectui#7479)
            //
            // objectui#7399 gave the catalogues one `i18n-locales` chunk so the
            // `framework` ceiling stopped budgeting them. That chunk held all
            // ten, and all ten were EAGER because `packages/i18n`'s entry
            // re-exported every pack statically. objectui#7479 made nine of
            // them `import()`ed on demand — and a single group would have
            // silently undone that: `advancedChunks` groups by MODULE, not by
            // reachability, so ten catalogues sharing one group are one chunk,
            // and one eager member makes that whole chunk eager. The laziness
            // would be real in the source and absent in the bundle, which is
            // the failure mode this whole card exists to avoid.
            //
            // So: one group per catalogue, ten single-module chunks, plus a
            // group for the i18n RUNTIME (provider, hooks, formatters) which
            // stays eager and is a hundredth of the size. The names are the
            // gate's handle — `scripts/check-eager-locale-catalogues.mjs` reads
            // `i18n-locale-<code>` out of the BUILT `eager-closure.json` and
            // fails if any code but the active one is eager.
            //
            // ⛔ Spelled out, one literal per line, for the same reason the
            // marketplace co-tenants below are: each entry is a measured fact,
            // and a computed table would also defeat the parse in
