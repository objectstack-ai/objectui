/**
 * `resolveSubmitRedirect` — objectui#4190, against the shape objectstack#7496
 * ruled and objectstack#7657 landed in `@objectstack/spec` (17.0.0 GA).
 *
 * ## What is pinned here, and what it is pinned AGAINST
 *
 * The module asks the spec's schema for its shape verdict instead of restating
 * the rule, so a table of hand-written expectations would pin this file's
 * opinion rather than the contract. Both accept/refuse suites therefore use the
 * REAL `FormViewSchema` as the oracle — `specAccepts()` below is the same parse
 * an authoring door performs — and assert that the two verdicts agree. That
 * makes these tests a drift detector for the contract, not for a copy of it:
 * if a later spec release widens or narrows the ruled shape, they follow it, and
 * they fail only if the renderer and the door ever disagree about one value.
 *
 * The strong pin is `emits a path the contract still accepts`: ruling point 2
 * requires every interpolated value to be URL-escaped when the redirect is
 * built, so the oracle is turned on the OUTPUT — whatever this module emits,
 * hostile record values and all, must still be a value the contract would
 * accept.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification — measured, and NOT what the obvious reading predicts
 *
 * Deleting the escape (interpolating the raw value) turns 10 tests red across
 * this file and `FormPage.redirect.test.tsx`, and WHICH assertion catches each
 * value is the part worth writing down, because re-parsing the emitted string is
 * necessary and **not sufficient**:
 *
 *   - the schema oracle catches only values whose raw form breaks the ruled shape
 *     ANYWHERE in the string — a backslash, whitespace, a control character. Those
 *     checks are not anchored to the start, so they still fire mid-path.
 *   - an address or a script scheme is NOT caught by it. Raw-interpolated,
 *     `/t/{{record.slug}}` becomes `/t/https://evil.example/steal`, which starts
 *     with `/` and carries no leading scheme — a perfectly spec-valid relative
 *     path that goes somewhere the author did not write. Only
 *     `toContain(encodeURIComponent(hostile))` sees that: the harm is injected
 *     path STRUCTURE, and relative-only has nothing to say about it.
 *   - a brace pair in the record trips the unresolved-interpolation backstop
 *     instead, refusing rather than emitting a token-bearing URL.
 *
 * So the two assertions in that block are not belt-and-braces; they cover
 * disjoint halves of "escaped enough", and dropping the second one would leave
 * the escape pinned only for the values the contract happens to reject twice.
 *
 * Deleting the whole parse and returning the url verbatim inverts the refusal
 * suite: every out-of-contract case goes red at once, which is the change
 * detector for this module's reason to exist. Deleting the CALL SITE instead
 * (restoring the browser-level navigation in `FormPage`) leaves this entire file
 * green — the module would simply be unused — which is why the mechanism is
 * pinned next to the rendered page and not here.
 *
 * Control characters below are written as escape sequences on purpose — a raw
 * one makes the whole file read as binary to grep, and this repo has paid for
 * that four times.

/**
 * A refusal CITES THE RULING it comes from — the durable property, in either
 * spelling the spec has used for it.
 *
 * This assertion's job is to discriminate the spec's own author-facing
 * prescription from a locally hand-written sentence (mutation probe 3 in
 * `ObjectForm.submitRedirect.test.tsx`'s header depends on it). It used to be
 * spelled `toContain('#7496')`, which pinned the CITATION FORM rather than the
 * citation: `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 kept every refusal and its reasoning and
 * only restated the provenance as `(ruled 2026-08-11)` instead of `#7496`, and
 * 14 assertions across three files went red for a token while the behaviour
 * they guard never moved. Same defect shape as objectui#7702 — a pin asserting
 * an incidental token instead of the durable property.
 *
 * ⛔ Not re-pinned to the new prose verbatim, which would only move the
 * brittleness one release along. What is asserted is that provenance is
 * PRESENT and machine-recognisable in the one shape BOTH upstream spellings
 * carry; a hand-written local sentence carries neither.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why there is no bare `#\d{3,}` alternative any more
 *
 * The first spelling of this regex was
 * `/\(ruled \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\)|#\d{3,}/` — two alternatives, to admit
 * either form upstream uses. The loose half discriminated NOTHING
 * (objectui#7122 contract review): this repo's own hand-written messages
 * routinely cite `objectui#NNNN`, so a locally authored sentence satisfied it,
 * and telling those two apart is this assertion's entire job. Only the
 * `(ruled …)` half was ever load-bearing.
 *
 * It was also unnecessary, which is the measurement that settled it. Both
 * spellings, read off the installed artifacts rather than recalled:
 *
 *   17.2.0  "… and this is an absolute URL (ruled 2026-08-11 on #7496)."
 *   17.3.0  "… and this is an absolute URL (ruled 2026-08-11)."
 *
 * The issue number never appears OUTSIDE that parenthesis, so `(ruled ` + a
 * date already matched both releases on its own. The optional ` on #NNNN` tail
 * keeps the 17.2.0 spelling admissible — the two-form latitude the alternative
 * was added for — without admitting a bare local `#7122`.
