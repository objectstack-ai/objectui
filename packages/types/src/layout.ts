   *
   * It used to be `name`, and `name` is not this node's private prop — it is
   * the SDUI IDENTITY key every authored node carries from
   * {@link BaseSchema.name}, alongside `id`. So an ordinary authored node like
   * `{ type: 'icon', id: 'save_icon', name: 'save_icon' }` asked lucide for a
   * glyph called `SaveIcon`, missed, and rendered NOTHING — silent at runtime
   * and clean-looking to a DOM gate, because a renderer that renders nothing
   * spreads no attributes to find.
   *
   * The maintainer ruled the contract question twice: 2026-08-22 (option A —
   * "`icon` is the icon key; `name` is identity, always") and again 2026-08-24
   * ("5631 A′，按一次正经的契约迁移立项。") at the full measured price,
   * once it was established that the renderer alone could not carry it: the
   * published mirror REQUIRED `name`, so the ruled shape was refused by the
   * contract while the renderer read a key the contract never declared.
   *
   * `action:*` already reads `icon`, so this is the vocabulary's existing
   * answer rather than a new one — and it leaves no node type on which the
   * identity key is unavailable.
   *
   * ⚠️ REQUIRED, exactly as `name` was required before it. A stored node that
   * still names its glyph with `name` is REFUSED by the zod mirror with a
   * message that names the migration, and renders the visible placeholder from
   * PR #5959 if it reaches the renderer unvalidated. Both are loud on purpose;
   * ⛔ there is no tolerant `icon ?? name` read anywhere — that shape was ruled
   * out explicitly, and it would make `name` mean two things depending on
   * whether a lookup happened to hit. To convert stored metadata, see

/**
 * The flex/stack layout members, declared ONCE and free of `BaseSchema`.
 *
 * This interface exists so that `StackSchema` can be "everything `FlexSchema`
 * has, with a different `type`" WITHOUT crossing an `Omit` over a type that
 * carries an index signature (objectui#6151).
 *
 * `StackSchema` used to be spelled `extends Omit<FlexSchema, 'type'>`. That
 * erased every named member from the SHIPPED declaration, silently:
 * `Omit<T, K>` is `Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, K>>`, and `keyof T` on a type
 * carrying a string index signature is `string | number` — the literal member
 * names are absorbed. `FlexSchema` inherits `BaseSchema`'s `[key: string]: any`
 * (objectui#5155), so `Exclude<string | number, 'type'>` is still
 * `string | number`, and the `Pick` reconstructed a type with the index
 * signature and NONE of the named members. Measured against the emitted
 * `dist/layout.d.ts`: `FlexSchema` declared 25 properties, `StackSchema`
 * declared 1 (`type`) — `gap`, `children`, `align`, `justify`, `direction` and
 * `wrap` were all absent, along with all 19 of `BaseSchema`'s other named
 * members.
 *
 * Nothing errored, which is why it survived: the index signature made every
 * absent key still assignable and still readable as `any`. What it cost was
 * every tool that reads the declaration — editor completion on a `stack` node
 * offered `type` and nothing else, and a docs-vs-type sweep read `stack.mdx` as
 * documenting keys that do not exist (objectui#6143 flagged `gap`, `children`
 * and `className` as divergences; the docs were right and the type was wrong).
 *
 * Extending FlexSchema directly instead is not available: an interface may
 * narrow an inherited property only to a subtype, and `'stack'` is not a
 * subtype of `FlexSchema`'s `type: 'flex'` — measured, TS2430
 * (`Interface 'StackSchema' incorrectly extends interface 'FlexSchema'.
 * Types of property 'type' are incompatible.`). Lifting the shared members out
 * of the inheritance path is what keeps them nameable from both sides.
 *
 * A member here carries an `@default` tag only when BOTH consumers apply the
 * same value — the criterion is a DIVERGENT shared member, not a shared one:
 * `align` and `direction` diverge and state their per-type values in prose
 * instead, while `justify` keeps its `@default 'start'` because `flex.tsx` and
 * `stack.tsx` both read `|| 'start'`.
 *
 * Pinned by `__tests__/stack-schema-emitted-members.test.ts`, which asserts
 * against the EMITTED declaration rather than this source — a source-level
 * assertion passes while the emitted declaration is empty, and that gap is
 * exactly the defect.
