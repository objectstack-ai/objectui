/**
 * How many rows a MAGNITUDE chart can actually give area to (objectui#7147).
 *
 * ## The third mechanism, and why neither landed answer reaches it
 *
 * Three distinct mechanisms on this surface produce ONE reader-facing symptom —
 * a tile that says nothing, or says something false, about rows it was handed:
 *
 *   - an early return that emits a bare `div`  — objectui#7140 / objectui#7146
 *   - a silent row DROP before the plot        — objectui#7148
 *   - DEGENERATE GEOMETRY, which is this one   — objectui#7147
 *
 * The rows here are never filtered. `data` reaches `<Pie>`, `<Funnel>` and
 * `<Treemap>` whole — the sankey arm's is the only row-dropping filter in this
 * file — and what happens instead is that a row whose measure is not above zero
 * is given no area. objectui#7148's count (`data.length - rows.length`) is
 * therefore exactly ZERO against these three families, so hoisting that
 * footnote here would render nothing at all while looking like coverage. Zero
 * area is not zero elements, and neither is a dropped row.
 *
 * ## The measurement that decided fix-over-decline, per family
 *
 * 56 tiles in real Chromium (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`) at `origin/main`
 * 40c4711d6 — six families x nine datasets — each tile screenshotted, MD5'd,
 * and pixel-diffed against a literally empty `div` of the same 520x240 box.
 * `measured-and-declined` was genuinely on the table for all three families,
 * as the card says, and survived for none of them:
 *
 *   - pie / donut, all-zero, all-null, all-negative: ZERO non-white pixels out
 *     of 124,800. Not blank-LOOKING — byte-identical to the empty div, while
 *     the DOM carried 31 descendants and a real `svg`.
 *   - pie / donut, `40` beside a `null`: a FULL circle in the first category's
 *     colour, 99.35% pixel-identical to a legitimately one-row dataset (diff
 *     0.654%, and that residue is the `paddingAngle` hairline, not
 *     information). The picture asserts "Alpha is 100%" of a dataset in which
 *     Beta was never measured at all.
 *   - funnel, `40` beside a `null`: 178 ink pixels — ZERO segments and ONE
 *     label, and the label is "Beta", the row with NO value. The row carrying
 *     40 draws nothing whatsoever.
 *   - funnel, all-negative: a large, healthy-looking two-band funnel whose mark
 *     area (220,320) EXCEEDS the all-positive control's (111,881).
 *   - treemap, `40` beside a `null`, `40` beside a `0`, and mixed-sign
 *     `40 / -25 / -12`: all three BYTE-IDENTICAL (diff 0.000%) to a genuinely
 *     one-row treemap — one full-bleed leaf labelled "Alpha". Four datasets,
 *     one image.
 *   - treemap, all-zero: one full-bleed leaf labelled "Beta" — the LAST
 *     category — asserting that one of two equal-zero categories is the entire
 *     composition.
 *
 * The controls are what make those zeros readable. On the same instrument an
 * all-zero BAR drew 5,128 ink pixels of axes and ticks — which is why bar is
 * deliberately NOT touched here: its reader can already tell. A two-row pie
 * differed from a one-row pie by 9.683% of its pixels and a two-row treemap
 * from a one-row treemap by 38.301%, so the instrument separates these datasets
 * easily whenever the renderer does.
 *
 * ## Why the predicate is `> 0`, and why the copy names it
 *
 * The reason `no-positive-flow`'s docstring gives. Five shapes reach here — a
 * genuine zero, a negative, `null`, an unparseable string, and a missing key —
 * and naming any ONE of them is a sentence that is false for the other four.
 * A strictly positive, finite measure is the single test all three families'
 * layouts effectively apply, so the copy names THAT.
 *
 * `Number.isFinite(v) && v > 0` rather than the sankey arm's `Number(...) || 0`
 * idiom: this predicate must also reject `Infinity`, which has no finite area
 * to occupy anywhere and which `|| 0` lets straight through.

/**
 * Whether a value can be PLACED on one of scatter's two numeric axes

 *
 * ## Why this is NOT `countSizableRows` with a different name
 *
 * Pie, funnel and treemap size a mark BY its measure, so `> 0` is the whole
 * test there. Scatter plots POSITION: a negative or zero coordinate is
 * perfectly ordinary data — temperatures, profit deltas, a variance around a
 * mean — and mechanically reusing objectui#7147's predicate here would REFUSE
 * correct charts, which is worse than the silence this card was opened about.
 * Measured on the sweep below rather than argued: an all-negative scatter drew
 * 3 of 3 marks, an all-zero scatter drew 2 of 2, and a mixed-sign scatter drew
 * 3 of 3 — three datasets `no-positive-magnitude` would have blanked outright.
 *
 * ## Every clause here was forced by a measurement, not by `Number()`
 *
 * `Number(v)` alone gets three of these WRONG, in both directions, which is why
 * the two rejections below are spelled out and the acceptance is not:
 *
 *   - `null` — `Number(null) === 0`, which is finite, so `Number()` alone calls
 *     it plottable. Recharts draws NOTHING for it (measured: 0 of 2 marks, and
 *     the axis renders no scale at all). REJECTED here.
 *   - `''` — the mirror-image trap. It LOOKS like a null and reads like one,
 *     and `Number('') === 0`. Recharts DOES plot it, at zero (measured: 2 of 2
 *     marks, x ticks `0,1,2,3,4`). So it stays PLOTTABLE: rejecting it would
 *     blank a chart that draws, which is the failure mode this whole guard
 *     exists to avoid.
 *
 * `Number.isFinite` covers the rest as measured: `'10'` plots (2 of 2 marks),
 * `'n/a'` and `'Infinity'` and an absent key do not (0 of 2 each).
 *
 * ## The one shape this predicate deliberately does NOT reject, and why
 *
 * A BOOLEAN coordinate was rejected in the first draft of this function — the
 * browser sweep had measured an all-boolean x drawing 0 of 2 marks, so it
 * looked like a sibling of `null`. Pinning it turned that red: a boolean beside
 * a genuinely numeric row draws EVERY mark (measured: 3 of 3). Recharts needs
 * one real number to build the scale and then coerces the booleans onto it, so
 * whether a boolean places depends on the OTHER rows.
 *
 * Rejecting it is therefore the worse error of the two available. The all-
 * boolean tile would gain a correct refusal, but the mixed tile would gain a
 * footnote reading "2 of 3 rows ... are not drawn" while all three are on
 * screen — a sentence that is simply false about the picture, which is the
 * failure this whole family of answers exists to remove. Accepting it leaves
 * the all-boolean case exactly as silent as it is today: a narrow hole, not a
 * regression, and one whose real answer belongs upstream where a boolean column
 * bound to a numeric measure could be refused at authoring time.

/**
 * How many rows scatter can actually PLACE — a point needs BOTH coordinates
 * (objectui#7171).
 *
 * ## The fourth mechanism on this surface
 *
 * Four distinct mechanisms now produce one reader-facing symptom, a tile that
 * says nothing or says something false about the rows it was handed:
 *
 *   - an early return emitting a bare `div`  — objectui#7140 / objectui#7146
 *   - a silent row DROP before the plot      — objectui#7148
 *   - degenerate GEOMETRY, magnitude         — objectui#7147
 *   - an unplaceable POINT, position         — this one
 *
 * It is genuinely a fourth. objectui#7147's rows are never filtered and are
 * painted at a meaningless scale; scatter's unplaceable rows are simply ABSENT
 * from the picture — measured, a 3-row dataset with one plottable pair emitted
 * exactly ONE `path.recharts-symbols`. That difference is why this note can
 * honestly say the points are "not drawn" where objectui#7147's deliberately
 * cannot.
 *
 * ## The measurement that decided fix-over-decline
 *
 * 33 tiles in real Chromium (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`) at `origin/main`
 * 899730e0a, one page load each, screenshotted, MD5'd and pixel-diffed against
 * a literally empty `div` of the same 520x360 box — a box above the chart's own
 * `CHART_MIN_HEIGHT` floor of 280, without which no footnote is visible at all.
 * The whole reason this card exists is that objectui#7147's sweep read scatter
 * through a SINGLE-measure fixture, so its all-positive control drew zero marks
 * and none of its zeros carried information. This fixture binds both axes and
 * its control DREW: 3 of 3 marks, 245px of mark area. What it then found:
 *
 *   - rows whose x AND y are both unplaceable render BYTE-IDENTICALLY (diff
 *     0.000%) to a scatter handed NO ROWS AT ALL. The reader is shown the
 *     empty-result picture for a query that returned rows.
 *   - `null` x, absent x, `'n/a'` x, `'Infinity'` x, boolean x, and
 *     objectui#7147's own category-column fixture — SIX datasets, ONE image
 *     (`51957063d9c2`): an axis frame with a confident y scale and no marks.
 *     Five of those six are answered below; the boolean one deliberately is
 *     not, for the reason `isPlottableCoord` gives.
 *   - one plottable row among three is 99.75% pixel-identical to a genuinely
 *     one-row scatter (diff 0.250%), the same shape of collision that decided
 *     pie in objectui#7147. Two rows vanish and the picture says "one point".
 *
 * ## Measured and DECLINED, so it is not guarded here
 *
 *   - ZERO VARIANCE — three rows at the same coordinate. A2.3 expected axis
 *     domain collapse; there is none. Recharts pads the domain exactly as it
 *     does for one row (x ticks `0,3,6,9,12` in both), draws 3 symbols, and the
 *     tile is 99.98% identical to a one-row scatter because three coincident
 *     points ARE one dot. That is overplotting, a property of the form itself,
 *     and the picture is TRUE — so there is nothing here to refuse.
 *   - a CONSTANT x or a constant y with the other varying: both draw every
 *     mark, with full scales on both axes.

  // 'preserveStartEnd'` plus recharts' own measured-width collision check

  // check itself, so the "hundreds of points" case above stays protected by
  // the SAME measured-overlap logic, just without the added tax. Verified in
  // real Chromium (this repo's DOM test env reports zero text metrics, so it
  // cannot exercise this at all — see the PR for the harness and counts):
  // at 290px, 7/7 and 8/8 bucket labels now draw with zero measured overlap
  // (rotated labels checked via their true rotated rectangles, not an
  // axis-aligned box — an axis-aligned check over-reports collisions for
  // diagonal text, which is the same conservatism recharts' own angled-tick
  // model (`getAngledRectangleWidth`) accepts rather than reimplements: real
  // collision is on PERPENDICULAR separation between parallel slanted lines,
  // and neither this file nor recharts computes that; both accept the
  // more-conservative projected-width model instead of bypassing it, as this

    // output. Its screenshot hashed `13237e6e19a7072a`, BYTE-IDENTICAL to a
    // genuinely one-row dataset `[{ New business: 40 }]` and to three other
    // thinned shapes (one positive among zeros, positive + nulls, positive +
    // unparseable). Six datasets, one image. A reader had no bit of information
    // distinguishing a complete flow from a third of one, and nobody re-reads a
    // dataset that renders fine.
    //
    // ## Why a note beside the chart, and not a refusal
    //
    // Not a style preference — a refusal is unavailable here. objectui#7146
    // pins "one positive row among zeros still draws", and that fixture
    // (`0 / 7 / 0`) is ITSELF a thinned dataset: it lands in this branch, and
    // hashes identical to the mixed-sign tile above. Refusing on a thinned flow
    // would blank the chart that pin requires drawn.

    // The drop is also not the defect. A flow has no negative width, so
    // discarding those rows is the only thing this arm CAN do with them. What
    // was missing was saying so — which is the whole change: the plot is the
    // element this arm already returned, unchanged, with one line of prose
    // under it.
    //
    // ## Why the copy names the PREDICATE and a COUNT, not a cause
    //
    // The reason the refusal above gives, and this branch is where that family
    // actually lives: `Number(…) || 0` folds negatives, zeros, `null`,
    // unparseable strings and a missing key into ONE discard, and all five were
    // measured reaching here beside a survivor. Naming any one of them is a
    // sentence that is false for the other four, so the copy names the
    // predicate the filter actually applies, which is true of all of them.
    //
    // The COUNT is the half a reader cannot recover from the picture. "Some
    // rows were dropped" still leaves a thinned flow indistinguishable from a
    // complete one; `1 of 3` is the bit that was missing.
    //
    // No console warning, matching the refusal above and unlike the two guards
    // at the bottom of this file: those carry a diagnostic PAIR that does not
    // fit on screen, whereas this sentence already names the key, the test it
    // failed, and how many rows failed it.

              What that looks like on screen is the whole card: an 8x8 dot in

              exactly the "x≈40, y≈-10" the card reported as a stray point.

              The y DOMAIN was never the defect and is deliberately not touched:
              the same run measured all six marks inside the plot area, and
              mixed-sign and all-negative fixtures draw every mark inside too,

 *
 *   - **key absent** — the dataset query grouped by a dimension it never

 *     nothing can be labelled; this guard says so, naming the missing key.
 *   - **key present, value null** — a real group whose key happens to be NULL
 *     (`{user_id: null, event_count: 50}`, the shipped first-boot state of
 *     System Overview's "Events by User"). The data IS there, so it is drawn:
 *     `buildChartSeries` maps it to an explicit bucket label upstream of this
 *     component, and that guard never fires because `'user_id' in row` is true.
 *
 * That upstream mapping deliberately does not ADD the key to a row that lacks

/**
 * The series-axis half of the same doctrine — objectui#4683.
 *
 * `hasNoCategoryKey` above answers "cannot know refuses loudly" for the FIRST
 * dimension. A pivoted chart has a second one, and it had no answer at all: a
 * pivot whose SECOND dimension was never projected produces
 * `series: []` with one bucket row per category, so the renderer drew axes,
 * grid, tooltip and legend around ZERO marks and said nothing. To the author
 * that reads as "no data matched", when what happened is that a dimension they
 * grouped BY never arrived.
 *
 * ## What this reads, and what it deliberately does NOT read
 *
 * The signal is `series: []` — {@link buildChartSeries}' own output — plus rows
 * to draw it against. NOT `groupKey in row`, which is the objectui#4507 trap
 * INVERTED: this component is handed the PIVOTED bucket rows, whose columns are
 * the group's VALUES, so the second dimension's own key is a column of no pivot
 * ever, ordinary ones included. A `key in row` test here would refuse every
 * grouped chart in the product.
 *
 * That keeps the three-way distinction intact, and each arm is pinned by a test:
 *
 *   - **null / `''` group values DRAW** (objectui#4673) — they are real groups,
 *     they get real buckets, so `series` is non-empty and this never fires;
 *   - **an unprojected group key REFUSES** — no row carries it, so no bucket
 *     exists, so `series` is `[]`: this fires;
 *   - **an ordinary pivot renders unchanged**, and so does a PARTIALLY
 *     projected one. That last is the mirror of `hasNoCategoryKey`'s own
 *     `!rows.some(…)`: the first dimension refuses only when NOT ONE row
 *     carries the key, and draws what projects otherwise. A pivot where some
 *     rows carry the group key yields those groups' series, so this stays
 *     silent and the chart draws what projected.
 *
 * ## Why the message cannot name the group key, and why that is honest
 *
 * `hasNoCategoryKey` names the key it could not find. This cannot, because the
 * renderer is not told which dimension the pivot grouped by — and the two
 * upstream shapes that reach it are byte-identical. Measured:
 * `buildChartSeries(rows, ['status','priority'], ['est_hours'])` with `priority`
 * unprojected and `buildChartSeries(rows, ['status'], [])` with no measure
 * selected BOTH return `{data:[{status:'Backlog'},…], xAxisKey:'status',
 * series:[]}`. Naming one cause would be a sentence that is false half the time,
 * which is worse than the silence this replaces — so the copy names the failure
 * and BOTH authoring causes, and the console warning carries the diagnostic pair
 * (`xAxisKey` + the keys the rows actually carry) exactly as the model does.
 *
 * ## Why `[]` and not "no series at all"
 *
 * `Array.isArray(series) && series.length === 0` — a binding that was COMPUTED
 * and came out empty, which is what both `buildChartSeries` call paths hand
 * over. `series === undefined` means no binding was ever computed (a caller that
 * never went through the helper); those charts are left byte-for-byte as they
 * were.
