 * Module-scoped store for related-list counts displayed in tab badges
 * (e.g. "Contacts (12)" on an Account detail). The store deduplicates
 * concurrent probes for the same key, lets the renderer subscribe with
 * `useSyncExternalStore`, and exposes invalidation hooks so other parts
 * of the runtime (bulk delete, inline create, optimistic update) can
 * keep the badges in sync without a full page refetch.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - One global Map keyed by `${objectName}::${relField}::${parentId}` so
 *    a count fetched by one tab strip is reused by every other consumer. A
 *    probe carrying a declared scope filter (objectui#4664) discriminates
 *    inside the relField segment, so a filtered and an unfiltered count over
 *    the same triple are separate entries rather than one wrong number.
 *  - Subscribers receive *all* keyspace changes; coarse-grained but
 *    badges are cheap to re-render and avoids per-key subscription noise.
 *  - We deliberately avoid Zustand here — the surface area is one Map +
 *    an emit() — and the React binding uses the built-in
 *    `useSyncExternalStore` so we don't grow the dependency graph.

    // `app-shell/src/views/RecordDetailView.relatedBadgeArity-8882.test.tsx`

    // multi-value column the way `driver-sql` does, and asserts the badge digits
    // equal the rendered row count at a POSITIVE count. Its sibling
    // `RecordDetailView.relatedListFilter-4664.test.tsx` holds the declared-scope
    // half. Delete either and this comment is a claim again.
    //
    // The parent condition is never negotiable — a declared filter may only
    // NARROW this parent's children — and `mergeFilterNodes` guarantees that
    // by wrapping both sources under one `and` rather than letting either
    // replace the other.
