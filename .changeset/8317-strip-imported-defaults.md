'@object-ui/types': minor

The validator stops writing values into an author's document on the keys it imports —
**this mirror authors no default, imported subschemas included** (objectui#8317,
director ruling, decision batch #90, 2026-09-08, under the maintainer's standing
delegation).

Decision batch #69 (objectui#7735) ruled a principle: *a validator validates; it does
not write values into an author's document.* PR #8299 delivered it for the 41
`.default()` call sites written in this package's own mirrors. Measured afterwards, **57
`ZodDefault` nodes were still reachable from the published `@object-ui/types/zod`
barrel**, every one inside a subschema imported by reference from `@objectstack/spec` —
so `safeValidateSchema` went on substituting on those keys, with 41 stripped and 57 not
and no way to tell which was which from the document. Batch #90 ruled that the
principle holds for **every** key the validator answers, and those 57 are now stripped
where the spec enters this package (`.removeDefault()`, the established local pattern,
applied through `zod/imported-defaults.ts`).

**What changes.** `safeValidateSchema` / `validateSchema` return the author's document
instead of the author's document plus keys they did not write:

```js
safeValidateSchema({ type: 'object-view', objectName: 'account', navigation: {} })
// before → navigation: { mode: 'page', preventNavigation: false, openNewTab: false, size: 'auto' }
// after  → navigation: {}
```

The affected families: `app`'s `active` / `isDefault` · `object-view`'s
`navigation.{mode, preventNavigation, openNewTab, size}` · `list-view`'s `sharing.type`,
`userActions.*`, `addRecord.*`, `appearance.*`, `chart.chartType`, `tabs[].*`,
`timeline.scale` · `kanban`'s `grouping.fields[].{order, collapsed}` · `page`'s `kind`
and the whole `interfaceConfig` subtree · dashboard `chartConfig.*`, `header.*` and
`globalFilters[].scope` · `object-gallery`'s `gallery.*` · `contextSelectors[].*` ·
`prefix.type`, `pagination.pageSize`, `selection.type` and the HTTP `method`.

**The accept set does not move, and that is measured, not asserted.** Every one of these
keys stays omissible — `.default(v)` carries optionality as well as a value, so the
boundary re-optionalises what `.removeDefault()` hands back. A differential against the
raw `@objectstack/spec` schemas (a permanent pin, since both sides are importable) plus
a run over this repository's own 1,077-document corpus found **zero** documents whose
acceptance changed, on the tolerant face and on the strict authoring face alike. Keys,
value vocabularies and every `.refine()` / `.superRefine()` the spec installed are
carried through unchanged.

**Migration.** If you read a value off `result.data` and relied on it being present
without having written it, read it off your own fallback instead — batch #69 already
ruled that the renderer's fallback is *the* authoritative default, and the renderers in
this workspace already carry theirs (`navigation?.mode ?? 'page'`,
`userActions.search !== false`). A census of every consumer of this barrel found no such
read: three production importers, one of which reads `result.data` at all, and it reads
only `type` / `id` / `label` / `title` / `children` — none of which carries a default on
any of the 107 component arms.

⛔ **Not taken:** changing `@objectstack/spec` itself (1,546 call sites on another
repository's release train). This is reversible into it — every strip becomes a no-op
the day the spec adopts the same principle, because the boundary is the identity
function on a subtree with nothing to strip.

⚠️ **Dated note, 2026-09-28 — one clean import is rebuilt — objectui#10872 batch 2.** Later in this same release the `element:number` arm imports the spec's `ElementDataSourceSchema` through this boundary. It carries no default but reaches a `z.lazy` (the recursive filter clause), and the walker always rebuilds a `lazy`, so for that one import the boundary returns an equal-answering clone rather than the spec's own object: "the identity function on a subtree with nothing to strip" holds for every other clean import, not that one. Nothing is stripped from it and its accept set does not move. The rest of this entry is kept as the reading of this change.
