/**
 * objectui#6148 — the gate for the property that lets a gate run pre-install.
 *
 * Eight workflow steps ran a `scripts/` gate before any `pnpm install`, and
 * exactly one of them had a test pinning its import graph to node builtins. The
 * other seven held the property by accident of what they happened to import,
 * and a violation is invisible to `tsc`, to ESLint, to a local run and to the
 * suite — it surfaces only as `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` in one CI job. For the
 * gates that carry no path filter *precisely so* they see every PR shape, that
 * is a gate which stops running rather than one that fails loudly.
 *
 * What this file pins, in the order the gate can go wrong:
 *
 *  1. **the derivation is a derivation** — the population comes from the
 *     workflows, so moving a step across `pnpm install` moves the population. A
 *     gate reporting "13 steps" while reading a constant is the defect it was
 *     written to prevent, and the only way to tell the two apart is to move a
 *     step in a fixture and watch the number follow;
 *  2. **the walk follows the graph** — a package ONE HOP away must be caught
 *     and its chain named, because the assertion this generalises could not see
 *     one;
 *  3. **the floor over the real tree** — every step objectui#6148 measured is
 *     still derived, by workflow and job rather than by count;
 *  4. **the wiring** — a gate nobody runs is indistinguishable from a gate that
 *     passes, so the workflow, the alias and the Dependabot classification are
 *     asserted here rather than trusted by reading;
 *  5. **the header states its population and never counts it** — objectui#8606.
 *     The header sentence describing this run carried a literal population of
 *     workflow files, derived from the same directory the gate derives from,
 *     and it had gone stale by double digits with nothing red in between. This
 *     is the fourth carrier of objectui#7448's document-count pin, and the
 *     first one pointed at this header.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted: the total number of pre-install steps. That number
 * is the gate's own output and moves whenever a workflow does; a hand-copied
 * count here would drift by construction, which is the lesson
 * `lint-workflow.test.ts` records at length.
