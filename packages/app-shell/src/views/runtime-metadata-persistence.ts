/**
 * ADR-0034 — Runtime metadata persistence seam.
 *
 * Runtime editing of **views / reports / dashboards** is unified with studio's
 * `/meta` per-item **draft → publish → version** model. A runtime edit stages a
 * per-item **draft** (invisible to other users, live in the editor's own
 * preview); an explicit **publish** promotes it to the active overlay and
 * records a version.
 *
 * This module is the single seam every runtime persistence call flows through,
 * so the call sites (ObjectView / ReportView / DashboardView / RuntimeDraftBar)
 * stay decoupled from the `MetadataClient` shape.
 *
 * The bespoke per-type tables (`sys_view` / `sys_report` / `sys_dashboard`) and
 * their shape adapters have been retired — there is no longer a feature flag or
 * a legacy write path here.
 *
 * **This seam is a view WRITER, so it invalidates the DataSource's view caches**
 * (objectui#4373). `ObjectStackAdapter` caches two view-shaped reads, and the
 * rows this module writes are the rows those reads enumerate — but the two
 * writers were disjoint: the adapter's own `createView`/`updateView`/… fixed
 * their key lists in objectui#4363, while the console's real create-and-publish
 * flow comes through HERE and invalidated nothing. Which keys they are stays the
 * adapter's business ({@link ViewCacheInvalidator}); all this module decides is
 * whether a given write is a view write, and it hands the object name down from
 * the call site.

/**
 * Unwrap a `?state=draft` GET response into its bare body, or `null` when

 *
 * The framework wraps draft reads in a `{ type, name, item }` envelope; a

 * `null` for an empty/absent draft so `!!readRuntimeDraft(...)` is a reliable
 * "has pending changes" check.
 *
 * The tolerant sibling of `@object-ui/data-objectstack`'s `extractDraftBody`,
 * and the tolerance is load-bearing rather than defensive: `readRuntimeDraft`
 * reads through `MetadataClient.get()`, which UNWRAPS the envelope at the
 * client boundary (objectui#4271), so the bare-body limb is the normal path
 * here and the envelope limb covers a body arriving by any other route. That
 * is the only reason this is a separate function; the two split on which
 * client method feeds them, not on what they mean.
 *
 * ⚠️ It mirrors that helper's read-decoration strip too (objectui#8181): the
 * body this returns is handed to `RuntimeDraftBar`'s `onResume`, which seeds
 * the host editor whose next save writes it back, so a served `_diagnostics` /
 * `_draft` would complete the round trip the spec's `stripReadDecorations`
 * exists to break. The key list is the spec's, never a copy; the ADR-0010
 * protection envelope is deliberately not on it and survives untouched.
 *
 * The emptiness verdict is taken BEFORE the strip — what counts as a pending
 * draft is the server's answer, and removing our own decorations must not be
 * able to turn a served draft into "no draft".
