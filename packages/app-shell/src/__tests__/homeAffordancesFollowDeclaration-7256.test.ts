 * objectui#7256 — no Home affordance in the console chrome may name `/home`
 * literally again.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * cloud's control plane lands a signed-in customer on the app declared with
 * `isDefault` (`cloud_control` → its Welcome page). The chrome did not follow:
 * the top-bar logo, both sidebar Home rows and the app-switcher Home entry each
 * hard-coded `/home`, the ENVIRONMENT layer's launcher (ADR-0075). One click on
 * the logo therefore left the control plane's guided welcome for a screen whose
 * "Build an app" / "Start from a template" cards act on an environment the
 * control plane does not have, and whose "Your apps" tiles are the control
 * plane's own internal management apps.
 *
 * The declaration was already there and already read by `/`
 * (`resolveLandingPath`). The chrome just wasn't reading it. That asymmetry is
 * what recurs: each of these four sites is a one-line link target, and typing
 * the literal is one keystroke cheaper than importing the hook.
 *
 * ## ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT ASSERT — read before adding a case here
 *
 * A SOURCE SCAN, not a behavioural test. It proves the literal is gone and the
 * hook is imported; it does not prove the hook answers correctly (that is
 * `hooks/__tests__/useHomePath.test.tsx`) nor that the declaration itself is
 * read correctly (`utils/__tests__/homePath.test.ts`). None of the three
 * replaces another.
 *
 * It also deliberately does NOT cover the "this app is gone, go somewhere safe"
 * redirects in `console/AppContent.tsx` / `console/ConsoleShell.tsx`. Those are
 * error-recovery paths, not Home affordances, and retargeting them moves a
 * `/home` expectation that a dozen existing tests pin — a separate change with
 * its own measurement.
 *
 * And it does not cover `apps/console`'s `/` resolver, which keeps its own
 * reading of the declaration — `landingHomeParity-7256.test.ts` compares the two
 * shipped answers directly, which is stronger than any scan of either file.
