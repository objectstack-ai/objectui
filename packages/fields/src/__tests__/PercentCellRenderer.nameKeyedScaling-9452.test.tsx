/**
 * objectui#9452 — `PercentCellRenderer` branched on the field's NAME before it
 * looked at the value, so a percent column whose name happened to contain
 * `progress` or `completion` read its stored FRACTION as percentage POINTS.
 * One stored `0.5` rendered `50%` beside the record H1 and `1%` in the list.
 *
 * ── What this file pins, and why it is rendered rather than computed ───────
 *
 * The renderer has TWO consumers of that one predicate and the card that filed
 * this measured only one of them:
 *
 *   - the NUMBER — `formatPercentBody` (no scaling) vs `formatPercent` (which
 *     applies `percentDisplayValue`);
 *   - the BAR's fill — a LOCAL restatement of `percentDisplayValue`'s own
 *     expression, reached only when the name did not match.
 *
 * So every assertion below reads the rendered cell: the value text, and the
 * `progressbar`'s `aria-valuenow`. ⛔ Never a local variable and ⛔ never the
 * formatter in isolation — a pin on `formatPercent` alone is green on the
 * defect, because the defect was the renderer choosing NOT to call it.
 *
 * ── Directions, predicted in writing BEFORE the run ────────────────────────
 *
 *   stored   field name          pre-fix number / bar    post-fix   verdict
 *   0.5      `progress`          `1%`   / `0.5`          `50%`/`50` RED pre-fix
 *   0.5      `completion`        `1%`   / `0.5`          `50%`/`50` RED pre-fix
 *   0.5      `in_progress_ratio` `1%`   / `0.5`          `50%`/`50` RED pre-fix
 *   12.3     either name         `12%`  / `12.3`         unchanged  CONTROL green
 *   57       either name         `57%`  / `57`           unchanged  CONTROL green
 *
 * The `12.3` and `57` rows are the control the filing card established: every
 * value at or above 1 agrees by construction, so those rows are green on BOTH
 * trees. They are what makes the `0.5` rows a reading rather than a harness
 * that cannot render a percent at all.
 *
 * ⭐ `in_progress_ratio` is here because the pattern was UNANCHORED and tested
 * against the whole lowercased name, so it matched on substring — a column that
 * merely mentions progress took the whole-percent path. After this change no
 * name reaches the scaling decision at all, which is what closes that door.
 *
 * Provider-mounted by construction (objectui#4514).
