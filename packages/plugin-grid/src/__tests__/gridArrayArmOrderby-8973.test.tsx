 *
 * `object-grid` NORMALIZES before it joins `$orderby` (objectui#8973).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * This block lowers `schema.sort` with private code rather than the shared
 * sink, and its array arm was a bare template interpolation:
 *
 *     params.$orderby = schemaSort.map((s: any) => `${s.field} ${s.order}`).join(', ');
 *
 * Every key was interpolated UNCONDITIONALLY, so an entry missing `field` or
 * `order` reached the wire as the literal text `undefined`. The legacy
 * `defaultSort` arm one `else` down had the identical defect on a single
 * object. (That arm is gone since objectui#5861 retired the key; its section
 * below now pins it inert.)
 *
 * ## Why this is a wire defect and not a cosmetic one — MEASURED, not assumed
 *
 * `normalizeSortNodes` (`@objectstack/metadata-protocol`, the one normalizer
 * every server ingress funnels through) reads the join string by splitting on
 * whitespace and validating the direction token:
 *
 *   - `"name undefined"` → direction `'undefined'`, "neither 'asc' nor 'desc'"
 *     → **`400 INVALID_QUERY`**. The list does not render degraded; it fails.
 *   - `"undefined desc"` → a WELL-FORMED sort on a column literally named
 *     `undefined` — the silently-wrong-ordering half of the same defect.
 *   - `""` → `[]`, i.e. benign at the server. Omitting the key is still the
 *     correct lowering, and it is the correction `toFilterNode` already made
 *     for `$filter: {}` on the filter leg of this very same query build:
 *     asking a question with no content is not the same as not asking.
 *
 * ## The wire shape does NOT move here
 *
 * The join string stays. Routing this arm through `convertSortToQueryParams`
 * would send that sink's `{field: direction}` map — route B on objectui#8767,
 * DECLINED by the maintainer on 2026-09-10 pending a card that measures the
 * server contract AND both readers. What IS shared is the decision the two
 * copies disagreed about: `normalizeSortEntries`, exported from
 * `@object-ui/core` alongside the map builder that now also delegates to it.
 * One operation, one implementation — for the operation that had two copies.
 *
 * ## Deliberately untouched
 *
 * The export path's `{field, direction}` projection, and the header-arrow
 * reader `parseSchemaSort` — untouched BY THIS CARD. ⛔ Do not read the latter
 * as a standing description of that reader: objectui#8961 has since narrowed it
 * to the declared `[{ field, order }]` array (ruled letter A, director batch
 * #135 item 5), so a retired string spelling now lights no arrow either and the
 * two readers of this key agree. Nothing below reads the header indicators, so
 * this file's pins are unaffected. The `headerSort` arm also keeps sending
 * `SortNode[]` objects rather than a join string — a documented, deliberate
 * difference, not a defect.
 *
 * ⚠️ The sentence this replaces cited objectui#8961 by its LABEL
 * (`pm:blocked`), which had moved before anyone read the line again. A card's
 * label is state nothing in this file re-derives; its RULING does not move, so
 * that is what is named here.
 *
 * ⭐ The CONTROL rows are what make the rest a measurement rather than a block
 * that mangles everything: if the fix had broken lowering outright, the
 * `"name desc"` rows would have gone dark and every "key is absent" assertion
 * would have passed for the wrong reason.
 *
 * ## objectui#8071 slice 17 — this file is now `object-grid.sort`'s MEMBER PIN
 *
 * The sections above were read end to end and promoted: they already constrain
 * what the renderer READS out of each `sort` entry, which is objectui#8068's
 * criterion. ⚠️ The "deliberately untouched" paragraph above stays true of the
 * CARD it describes and is no longer true of the FILE: a fourth section below
 * reads both of the arms #8973 left alone — the export projection and
 * {@link parseSchemaSort} — because a member pin has to say what every reader
 * of the member does with it. It changes neither of them. The registry entry
 * for this key lives in
 * `apps/console/src/__tests__/registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts`.

 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ **They do NOT agree, and the disagreement is pinned rather than

 * an ascending arrow, and asks the export door for `direction: 'descending'`.
 * ⛔ Not repaired here: objectui#8071 slice 17 is a member PIN, and a fix that

 * Reported as a finding instead; this section is the reproduction.
 *
 * ⭐ `exportServer.test.tsx` already pins the HAPPY path of that projection
