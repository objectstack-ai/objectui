 * MetadataFieldsPage
 *
 * Setup-app container that renders {@link FieldDesigner} bound to one
 * object's `fields` map, loaded from `GET /api/v1/meta/object/:name`
 * and persisted by issuing `PUT /api/v1/meta/object/:name` with the
 * merged-back fields. Mirrors {@link MetadataObjectsPage}.
 *
 * Why we save the *parent object* instead of `/meta/field/:name`:
 *   In the ObjectStack data protocol, fields live INSIDE an object's
 *   `fields: Record<string, FieldSchema>` map — there is no per-field
 *   document in the canonical Zod source. The metadata type registry
 *   does expose `type: 'field'` for cases where a field is shipped as
 *   a stand-alone artifact (third-party extension), but the normal
 *   path used by the Setup app is to mutate the parent object so the
 *   round-trip stays consistent with the artifact format the CLI dump
 *   produces (`*.object.ts`).
 *
 * The container preserves any object-schema attribute it doesn't
 * know about (indexes, hooks, permissions, lifecycle, …) by deep
 * cloning the loaded raw payload and only swapping in the new
 * `fields` map on save.
 *
 * The same principle runs one and two levels down. Per-field KEYS
 * the designer does not render survive via `carryOver`; and a whole
 * FIELD whose stored `type` the designer cannot author is carried
 * through verbatim rather than rebuilt from a model that has no way
 * to hold it (objectui#8060 — see `partitionStoredFields`). Those
 * fields are listed on the page read-only, showing their real stored
 * type, instead of being drawn as editable `text` fields.

 * Does the designer own this stored `type` — i.e. can it round-trip it?
 *
 * ## What this replaced, and why the replacement is a PARTITION and not a default
 *
 * This predicate is what is left of `toDesignerType`, which answered
 * `DesignerFieldType` for every input by falling back to `'text'`
 * (objectui#8060). That fallback was not a display default: `toDesignerField`
 * called it on the READ path, so the collapse happened before the author saw
 * anything, and `fromDesignerField` emits `type: designed.type`, so the
 * collapsed value was written back. Relabelling ONE field rewrote every other
 * field whose type this designer does not author:
 *
 *   stored { parent_id: { type: 'master_detail', reference: 'invoice' } }
 *   relabel an unrelated `name` field
 *     => WIRE { parent_id: { "type": "text", "reference": "invoice" } }
 *
 * `text` is a LEGAL spec type, so the PUT succeeded, the designer redrew the
 * field as text, and nothing reported it. Restoring the relationship required
 * knowing what the type used to be, which the stored document no longer said.
 *
 * ## The census — measured, not estimated (objectui#8060 step 1)
 *
 * `DESIGNER_FIELD_TYPES` has 27 members and every one of them is a declared
 * `FieldType`, so the designer's vocabulary is a strict SUBSET of the spec's.
 * `FieldType` in `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 declares 49. The difference is 22
 * members, and each one was a distinct data-loss case:
 *
 *   secret, richtext, toggle, multiselect, radio, checkboxes, master_detail,
 *   tree, user, avatar, video, audio, summary, composite, repeater, record,
 *   json, signature, qrcode, progress, tags, vector
 *
 * The card confirmed two of them (`master_detail`, `vector`); the other 20 are
 * enumerated here. The set is pinned by size AND by membership in
 * `MetadataFieldsPage.storedTypePreserved.test.tsx`, which drives its class pin
 * from the difference rather than from a hand-written list — a fix scoped to
 * the two known members would leave 20 fields failing in the way that is
 * hardest to notice next.
 *
 * ⚠️ The 22 are the census, NOT the predicate. This function deliberately does
 * not consult `@objectstack/spec`: see {@link partitionStoredFields} for why a
 * type in NEITHER set is preserved too.

/**
 * The relationship target a stored field definition holds, under EITHER
 * spelling — objectui#8058.
 *
 * `reference` is the spec's key and is read first; the pre-objectui#6041
 * `referenceTo` is consulted only when the spec key holds nothing, so a
 * partly-migrated document carrying both is read from `reference` and the
 * retired key is ignored.
 *
 * ## Why reading the retired spelling is a RENAME here and not a laundering
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` treats the two as one key under two spellings and says
 * so in the refusal itself. Measured on the installed 17.4.0:
 *
 *   FieldSchema.safeParse({ type: 'lookup', label: 'L', referenceTo: 'account' })
 *     => success = false
 *     => unrecognized_keys — "Did you mean `referenceTo` → `reference`?"
 *   FieldSchema.safeParse({ type: 'lookup', label: 'L', reference: 'account' })
 *     => success = true
 *
 * `referenceTo` is one of five spellings `FieldSchema`'s alias map renames onto
 * `reference` (`relatedTo`, `target`, `targetObject`, `lookupObject` are the
 * rest). Both sides carry the same value — a single object machine name,
 * `reference: z.string().optional()` upstream and
 * `DesignerFieldDefinition.referenceTo?: string` here — and the value this page
 * emits as `reference` today is read from the SAME designer-model property its
 * pre-objectui#6041 build emitted as `referenceTo`. Same type, same id form,
 * same cardinality; nothing about the value changes on the way through.
 *
 * ⭐ That is what separates this from objectui#6043, where the identical-looking
 * `formula` → `expression` rename was REFUSED. The alias map lists that pair
 * too, but its two sides do NOT carry the same value: `expression` is CEL while
 * the retired textarea accepted arbitrary text, so adopting the old key would
 * have laundered non-CEL text into a formula that parses green and evaluates to
 * null. There is no value grammar to violate here — a target is an object name
 * at either spelling. ⛔ Do not cite objectui#6043 against this read without
 * answering that difference; it is a different situation, not a smaller one.
 *
 * ## Why a NON-STRING retired value is not adopted
 *
 * The narrowing is the designer model's (`referenceTo?: string`), and it is
 * also the better reading. `carryOver` strips the retired key either way, so a
 * stored `referenceTo: 42` leaves no target behind whatever we do; refusing it
 * here means {@link describeUnusableTarget} says "this one has none" — pick a
 * target — instead of reporting a number the author has no control left to see
 * or clear. An EMPTY string IS adopted: it is a value the document holds and
 * the guard has its own answer for it. Filtering values here would make this a
 * semantic change instead of a spelling one, which is the line objectui#6043
 * drew.

/**
 * Field keys the ObjectStack spec REJECTS by name, dropped out of
 * {@link carryOver}.
 *
 * Derived from the tombstone registry (`RETIRED_FIELD_KEY_TOMBSTONES` in
 * `@object-ui/types`, objectui#6527) — this carry-over is the registry's
 * `metadataFieldsPageCarryOver` site. The registry names each retired key, the
 * card that retired it, and which sites strip it; the per-key evidence lives
 * there. What stays HERE is what is specific to THIS writer's history:
 *
 * Each key is one this page's own era wrote (`indexed` via the Advanced
 * section of {@link FieldDesigner}, objectui#4644; `referenceTo` via
 * `fromDesignerField`'s old emit line, objectui#6041; `isSystem` as a declared
 * `ServerFieldSchema` member served back to us, objectui#6044; `formula` via
 * the retired formula textarea, objectui#6043), and `fromDesignerField`
 * spreads `prev` verbatim to preserve unknown keys — so a stored object from
 * that era would carry the key straight back out to
 * `PUT /api/v1/meta/object/:name` as a hard 422 (`INVALID_METADATA`) that
 * blocks every later save, with no control left on screen to clear it.
 * Stripping the carried-over keys is what makes an edit-and-save round-trip of
 * such an object come out parseable; it is keyed to the tombstones, so every
 * other unknown key the designer does not render still survives.
 *
 * Two of the four cost nothing on the path through the DESIGNER, and the
 * `referenceTo` half is true only because the read door was taught to find the
 * target under BOTH spellings (objectui#8058). `toDesignerField` reads
 * `reference` and falls back to the retired key — see
 * {@link storedRelationshipTarget} — so whichever spelling the stored document
 * used, the target reaches the designer model and `fromDesignerField` re-emits
 * it under the spec spelling `reference` on the very next line: the strip then
 * removes a KEY and not the relationship. The system flag is the other
 * cost-free entry — it is read back from the spec spelling `system` and never
 * re-emitted (the strip IS the whole write half of objectui#6044), and `system`
 * is what the framework's system-field injection sends on every load, so no
 * stored value is being relied on.
 *
 * ⛔ The `referenceTo` claim is conditional on that READ, not on the re-emit
 * line alone. Before objectui#8058 this sentence asserted the same conclusion
 * with no fallback behind it, and it was FALSE for exactly one shape: a field
 * whose target survived ONLY as `referenceTo` read as target-less, so the strip
 * took the stored value with it and the field reached the wire as a `lookup`
 * with no target at all. Restating the conclusion without the read door is how
 * it went wrong the first time.
 *
 * ⚠️ This function alone is cost-free on the DESIGNABLE half only — the half
 * that has a read door. {@link toFieldsMap} re-emits the fields this designer
 * cannot author from the stored document directly (see
 * {@link partitionStoredFields}), with no `toDesignerField` in the path, so a
 * stored `master_detail` whose target lived only as `referenceTo` had it
 * stripped and reached {@link assertRelationshipTargetPresent} with nothing —
 * worse there than here, because a preserved field is read-only on this page and
 * the refusal named a control the author had no way to reach. objectui#8896
 * closed that by routing the preserved branch through
 * {@link carryPreservedField}, which reads the target with the SAME
 * {@link storedRelationshipTarget} this half uses; ⛔ the preserved branch calls
 * that function, never this one. `formula` is the one entry
 * whose strip DROPS a value, and that is objectui#6043's deliberate trade: the
 * server refuses to store it, a blind rename to `expression` would launder
 * non-CEL text into a formula that parses green and evaluates to null, and
 * with the textarea gone stripping is the only way out of the 422. The
 * migration surface for the VALUE is metadata-admin's `ObjectFieldInspector`
 * (ruled again on objectui#6526, option B), which is why the READ door's list
 * does not include `formula` while this write door's does. `expression` itself
 * is a real `FieldSchema` key and rides through `carryOver` untouched.
 *
 * `sortOrder` is absent here on the same unmeasured premise it always had: no
 * shipped writer on this tree ever populated a field-level one (objectui#6045)
 * — see its tombstone for the one site that keeps a recorded-defensive strip.

 * Carry one PRESERVED field through, keeping the relationship target the stored

 *
 * ## Why the preserved half needs its own function
 *
 * objectui#8058 made the `referenceTo` strip cost nothing ON THE DESIGNABLE
 * HALF, by teaching the read door to find the target under either spelling: the
 * value reaches the designer model through {@link storedRelationshipTarget} and
 * `fromDesignerField` re-emits it as `reference`, so the strip removes a KEY and
 * not the relationship. {@link toFieldsMap} re-emits objectui#8060's preserved
 * fields from the stored document directly, with no `toDesignerField` in the
 * path — so there the strip WAS the last thing to touch the field, the target
 * left with the key, and {@link assertRelationshipTargetPresent} refused the
 * whole object's save. That refusal names a control this page does not have: a
 * preserved field is rendered read-only here by design, so "Pick the target
 * object" has nowhere to go and every later save of the object stayed refused.
 *
 * ## It states the SAME rule as the designable half, through the same reader
 *
 * `storedRelationshipTarget` is the one place that decides which spelling a
 * stored target is read from, and both halves now go through it — the sibling
 * writers' `toFieldsMap` / `carryOver` pair is already a family where a
 * difference is a defect waiting to be found twice. Whether the value is USABLE
 * stays entirely `assertRelationshipTargetPresent`'s question, exactly as on the
 * designable half: this function adopts what the document holds and invents
 * nothing, so a stored `referenceTo: '   '` is refused by name rather than
 * smuggled through, and a field with no target under either spelling emits no
 * `reference` key at all.
 *
 * ⛔ The retired KEY still never reaches the wire — `FieldSchema` refuses it by
 * name, which is what the strip is for. ⛔ And this is NOT a `specEquivalent`
 * migration driven off the tombstone registry; the registry is explicit that the
 * field is "Documentation for the reader, NEVER an instruction to migrate a
 * value mechanically". What makes THIS key readable under either spelling is
 * argued once, at {@link storedRelationshipTarget}, and applies here unchanged.

 * | absent                    | designable    | nothing stored, so nothing to destroy  |
 *
 * The absent case is deliberate and is NOT the old fallback returning under a
 * new name. The defect was rewriting a type the author's document HELD; a field
 * with no `type` holds none, so `'text'` there invents a value rather than
 * replacing one. Routing it to the preserved half instead would emit a
 * type-less field the spec refuses and give the author no control to repair it.
 *
 * ## ⭐ A type in NEITHER set is preserved as well, and that is the decision
 *
 * The predicate asks only "does `DESIGNER_FIELD_TYPES` contain it". It does NOT
 * ask `@objectstack/spec` whether the value is a legal `FieldType`, and the
 * omission is chosen rather than skipped:
 *
 * 1. **A stale local vocabulary must not get a vote on destruction.** The spec
 *    is a versioned dependency and the stored document was written by a server
 *    that may be AHEAD of the copy bundled here. Flattening everything this
 *    build's `FieldType` does not recognise would re-create this very defect
 *    the day the spec declares its 50th type — silently, and only for the
 *    people running a newer backend.
 * 2. **Re-sending a genuinely garbage type is the LOUD failure, not the silent
 *    one.** `FieldSchema` refuses an unknown type by value, so the PUT comes
 *    back `422 INVALID_METADATA` naming `fields.<name>.type`: the author is
 *    told, and the stored document is untouched and still repairable. Rewriting
 *    it to `text` is the opposite trade — the save SUCCEEDS and the evidence of
 *    what the field was is gone. This card exists because that trade was made.
 * 3. It keeps `@objectstack/spec` out of this plugin's runtime graph. The
 *    census above is derived in the TEST, where being one spec version behind
 *    makes a pin stale rather than makes a document lossy.
 *
 * A non-string `type` (an untrusted payload can carry `42`) is "present and
 * outside the set", so it preserves too, on exactly reason 2.

/**
 * Refuse a relationship field whose target is unusable — BEFORE the PUT.
 *
 * ## The failure this closes, measured in a running designer
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 made `reference` a hard requirement on `lookup`
 * and `master_detail` (a `custom` refinement at path `reference`). At 17.2.0
 * the requirement was prose only — `{ type: 'lookup', label: 'L' }` parsed
 * green at field level AND through `ObjectSchema` — so this page persisted
 * target-less drafts freely.
 *
 * objectui#7714 drove that against a real 17.3.0 backend rather than inferring
 * it: creating a `lookup` and leaving its target empty PUT the whole object and
 * got `422 INVALID_METADATA` at `fields.<name>.reference`, and the next edit —
 * to a DIFFERENT, already-saved field — was refused identically, because the
 * half-filled draft rides along in the same document. The author sees that
 * later edit rendered as applied while the server has none of it. The cost of
 * letting the draft leave the client is not one failed save; it is every
 * subsequent save of that object for the rest of the session.
 *
 * The maintainer's reconciliation (objectui#7122 ruled item 4, 2026-09-05) is
 * that the incomplete draft stays in the client and is never PUT. ⛔ Not the
 * alternative of stripping the incomplete field from the body while still
 * reporting a save — that shows the author a field the server never received,
 * the silent-drop shape objectstack#4001 closed.
 *
 * This raises inside the caller's save `try`, so the message lands in the
 * page's existing error surface — the same banner a nameless or duplicated
 * field already produces, and no new UI affordance.
 *
 * ## The `.trim()` MIRRORS the contract — it is no longer a local opinion
 *
 * The predicate is `typeof reference === 'string' && reference.trim() !== ''`.
 * It WAS a declared divergence when written: 17.3.0's #13632 refinement spelled
 * its emptiness test as an equality against `''`, so the spec accepted a
 * whitespace-only target while this page refused it. objectstack#16920 (merged
 * 2026-09-08, closing objectstack#16126) applies that test to the TRIMMED value
 * — `packages/spec/src/data/field.zod.ts`, the `FieldSchema` `superRefine`:
 *
 *   if (
 *     (field.type === 'lookup' || field.type === 'master_detail') &&
 *     (field.reference === undefined || field.reference.trim() === '')
 *   ) { ctx.addIssue({ code: 'custom', path: ['reference'], … }); }
 *
 * Same `custom` issue, same `reference` path, same message absent and `''`
 * already got, so this page and the contract now refuse the identical set.
 *
 * ⭐ That fix SHIPPED IN 17.4.0, and the pin has reached it (objectui#8772):
 *
 *   FieldSchema.safeParse({ type: 'lookup', label: 'L', reference: '   ' })
 *     => success = false, `custom` at path ["reference"]
 *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ …, fields: { rel: { …, reference: '   ' } } })
 *     => success = false, `custom` at path ["fields","rel","reference"]
 *
 * (controls in the same run: `'account'` and `' account '` both accepted, so
 * the schema is consulted and this is a real reading — the trim is for the TEST
 * only, and a target with surrounding whitespace is still stored as written.)
 *
 * ⛔ Those two lines say WHEN the contract changed, not what is installed
 * today. The claim that rotted here said the opposite — "this repo's pin IS
 * 17.3.0", a present-tense reading of an artifact — and it went false the
 * moment the pin moved, while still being shown to authors (objectui#8897).
 * What is installed is MEASURED, never asserted in prose; the sibling reading
 * lives in `MetadataService.specKeyReference.test.ts`, which re-parses the
 * schema on every run.
 *
 * ⭐ Kept — now for its OWN reason rather than the divergence's. It refuses at
 * EDITOR time, before the PUT, naming the field while it is still on screen;
 * the contract refuses at the publish gate, where the same shape arrives as a
 * 422 on the whole object document with the half-filled draft riding along. A
 * whitespace-only `reference` names no object at either end — the spec's own
 * `ObjectSchema.fields` key grammar (`/^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$/`) admits no
 * whitespace-bearing name for it to resolve to — so admitting it buys the
 * author nothing and only moves the identical failure past the PUT and into a
 * stored document, where it surfaces with no field named.
 *
 * ⭐ The refusal MESSAGE below has RETIRED its divergence wording, which is what
 * the note it replaces said would happen — "it retires with the pin bump, not
 * with this note". objectui#8897 is that retirement. It no longer tells the
 * author that the spec ACCEPTS a blank target and that the PUT would succeed;
 * against the installed artifact both halves were false, and that sentence was
 * the one USER-VISIBLE carrier of this rot.

/**
 * Key the designer's field list by field NAME — the shape `ObjectSchema.fields`

 * (objectui#6489).
 *
 * Ported from the sibling object writer, app-shell's
 * `MetadataService.toFieldsMap` (objectui#6240), deliberately down to the
 * refusal wording: the two writers are the objectui#5761 parity family, and a
 * difference between them is a defect waiting to be found twice.
 *
 * ## Why `Object.fromEntries` and not assignment into a literal
 *
 * `map['__proto__'] = def` does not create a key — it invokes the prototype
 * setter — and `__proto__` is a SPEC-LEGAL field name (`ObjectSchema.fields`'
 * key schema is `/^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$/`, which it matches). Built by assignment,
 * such a field disappeared from the serialised PUT body while the spec stood
 * ready to accept it. Measured on `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0:
 *
 *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ …, fields: { ['__proto__']: { type: 'text', label: 'P' } } })
 *     => success = true
 *
 * `Object.fromEntries` defines an own property instead. This is what makes the
 * construction load-bearing rather than stylistic.
 *
 * ## Why a missing name THROWS instead of writing `{ undefined: … }`
 *
 * `DesignerFieldDefinition.name` is declared required, but this page is handed
 * whatever the in-memory designer model holds. A nameless field keys as the
 * literal string `"undefined"` — and the spec does NOT catch that either:
 *
 *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ …, fields: { undefined: { type: 'text', label: 'N' } } })
 *     => success = true
 *
 * So it parses, it is STORED, and no reader anywhere looks for it: a silently
 * corrupt document in place of a loud refusal.
 *
 * ## Why a duplicate name throws too
 *
 * That one is the conversion's OWN hazard rather than an inherited one: the
 * designer's list can carry two fields called `amount` and a map cannot, so the
 * later entry silently swallowed the earlier. Refusing is the only reading that
 * does not lose a field the author declared.
 *
 * The caller runs this inside its save `try`, so a refusal lands in the page's
 * existing error surface. That is the one deliberate difference from the
 * sibling writer, and it is forced by the caller's shape: `onFieldsChange` is
 * fire-and-forget (`void handleFieldsChange(next)`), so throwing to it would
 * produce an unhandled rejection and show the author nothing — the same silent
 * failure this function exists to end. The property both writers do share is
 * the one that matters: it raises BEFORE the request, so a refused list issues
 * no PUT at all.
