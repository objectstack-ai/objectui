/**
 * objectui#7946 — the `widget-schema-anchors` family's third widget.
 *
 * `widget-schema-anchors-6576.test.ts` beside this file did the gallery and the
 * data table: two `Object*Props` whose `schema` anchored to a hand-rolled
 * literal. `ObjectChart` was the harder case of the same shape — its prop type
 * anchored to nothing at all, because the component was published as
 * `(props: any)`. Maintainer ruling 2026-09-09 (director seat, summon #20,
 * decision batch #108 item 3) applied #6576's option A to it: anchor the props,
 * declare the four keys the producers write and the renderer reads, converge
 * the `colors` drift, and pin the read census here.
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and where the rest lives
 *
 * 1. TYPE-LEVEL, on `ObjectChartSchema` in this package: it extends
 *    `BaseSchema`, carries the registry key as its `type` literal, inherits the
 *    base members with their DECLARED types (not `any`), and declares the four
 *    keys with the value types measured at their READ sites — `ChartRendererProps`
 *    for `xAxisKey`/`series`, `ObjectChart.tsx` for `aggregate`/`filter` — not
 *    copied from any producer's literal, which is what the ruling asked for.
 * 2. MIRROR PARITY, per key: the zod copy declares the same four, and `colors`
 *    is now on both faces. Before this card the mirror declared `colors` and
 *    the interface did not, and NOTHING ratcheted that direction —
 *    `zod-mirror-parity.test.ts` measures declared-but-unmirrored and
 *    mirror-wider-than-declared, and a key present ONLY on the mirror is in
 *    neither. That is why the drift survived from objectui#3913 to here.
 * 3. READ CENSUS, source-level, on the widget file: every key read off `schema`
 *    is declared by the mirror or ledgered by name below. Read off disk the way
 *    `widget-schema-anchors-6576.test.ts` reads its widgets — this package
 *    cannot import the plugins.
 *
 * The anchoring of the PROP type to the schema type is pinned where it can be
 * compiled, beside the widget:
 * `plugin-charts/src/__tests__/ObjectChart.schemaAnchor-7946.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## AUTHORABLE vs INTERNAL — the ruling asked for the reading, per key
 *
 * The four keys do not share one verdict, and the ledger below records the two
 * that are INTERNAL so the declaration is not mistaken for new authorable
 * vocabulary. Ground for each is in `ObjectChartSchema`'s own docblock; the
 * short form:
 *
 *   - `aggregate`, `filter` — AUTHORABLE. `@objectstack/spec` names their
 *     carrier as this component's own react props and parses `aggregate` at the
 *     react-page publish gate; the registry `inputs` advertises both.
 *     ⭐ `aggregate` is therefore declared BY REFERENCE (`ChartAggregate` /
 *     `ChartAggregateSchema`), not as a local shape of the same name: where the
 *     spec owns the authoring door, one symbol is the whole point, and the
 *     differential at the bottom of the mirror section is what proves it is the
 *     spec's and not a look-alike.
 *   - `xAxisKey`, `series` — INTERNAL. All five producers COMPUTE them, the
 *     spec's author-facing vocabulary spells the same slots `xAxis`/`{ name }`
 *     and REFUSES the internal spellings by name, and neither appears in the
 *     registry `inputs`. They are declared anyway because they are already
 *     passed through `.passthrough()` unvalidated; declaring buys the VALUE
 *     check without minting authorable vocabulary.
 *
 * ## The ceiling, stated rather than assumed (objectui#5155)
 *
 * `BaseSchema` still carries `[key: string]: any`, so anchoring buys DECLARED
 * members their declared types and does NOT buy rejection of a misspelling.
 * The counter-probe below pins that honestly, as #6576's does.
