/**
 * The 13 renderer-read keys that no shipped type declared (objectui#6150).
 *
 * ## What the card measured, and what this file pins
 *
 * A census over all 76 `content/docs/components/**` pages found 68 documented
 * keys that are not declared members of their shipped type; **13** were shown
 * to be genuinely READ by the renderer. Those are capabilities that work at
 * runtime, that the docs describe, and that the published contract never
 * mentioned — the reads compile only because `BaseSchema` ends with
 * `[key: string]: any` (objectui#5155), so `schema.trigger` on a type that
 * never declared `trigger` resolves to `any` instead of erroring.
 *
 * Re-derived on this branch before anything was edited, through the SAME
 * resolution path the census used (built `packages/types/dist/index.d.ts`, and
 * cross-checked against `src/index.ts` — the two agreed on all 8 types): all 13
 * were still undeclared, and all 13 reads were still present.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ "Complete" above holds ONLY for the un-cast spelling
 *
 * ⛔ Nothing above clears this class. Every read that census matched is spelled
 * `schema.KEY`, a plain member access; it never looked for the cast spelling
 * `(schema as any).KEY`. A reader who takes "13 genuinely READ" as the whole
 * population concludes the class has been swept and stops looking — which is
 * how objectui#7105 stayed open as long as it did.
 *
 * Measured, not asserted (objectui#8327). Re-running the CAST spelling alone
 * over every tracked production `.ts`/`.tsx` under `packages/`, `apps/` and
 * `examples/` on `origin/main` `154fe2a` — with the cast-aware `schemaReads`
 * instrument this package already carries in
 * `widget-schema-anchors-6576.test.ts` (objectui#6576), enumeration and reading
 * both taken from that one ref — finds 112 (file, key) reads: 88 distinct keys
 * across 23 files. Asked of the TypeScript checker rather than of a grep, 29 of
 * the 112 are undeclared on the type the renderer is handed, 8 more are
 * declared on only one arm of a union `schema` type, and 5 cannot be answered
 * at all because the renderer is handed `any`. None of those 23 files is a
 * reader listed below: the two populations were found by two instruments, and
 * only the un-cast one has ever run for this file.
 *
 * ⚠️ Those 29 are NOT pending rows for this ledger. objectui#8327 classifies
 * all 112, and 31 of them are ALREADY RULED non-author surface — the
 * objectui#5091 grid ruling and the objectui#5097 host-composition ruling —
 * so they must never be declared. Every row here is a published-type widening
 * per key; adding one without its own ruling is not bookkeeping.
 *
 * ⭐ This file's completeness claim has now been falsified twice, from two
 * different directions: by the cast spelling above, and by objectui#6938, which
 * found four more keys the same 76-page census could not see. ⛔ Do not repair
 * that by widening the claim — state the blind spot, which is what this section
 * is for.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ This is NOT a key-membership widening — measured, not assumed
 *
 * Every one of the 8 mirrors extends `BaseSchema`, which is `.passthrough()`,
 * and `.extend()` carries that policy through (measured on the built mirrors:
 * `catchall` is `z.unknown()` on all 8). So **before this card every one of the
 * 13 keys already parsed green and already survived the parse** — admitted
 * unexamined, not refused and not stripped. What changes here is:
 *
 *   1. **declaration** — the key becomes a member of the shipped TypeScript
 *      type, so an editor completes it and an annotation checks it; and
 *   2. **enforcement** — for the 12 mirrored keys the value is now VALIDATED.
 *      In the value dimension that is a NARROWING, not a widening: `content: 42`
 *      parsed green before and is refused now.
 *
 * The same reading is why membership below is asserted on the mirror's own
 * `.shape` and never on parse acceptance — under `.passthrough()`, acceptance
 * cannot tell "declared" from "admitted unexamined" (the form
 * `object-grid-title-mirrored.test.ts` established for objectui#6639).
 * `undeclaredSentinel` is the control that keeps that distinction visible: an
 * undeclared key of the wrong type is still admitted, exactly as before, on
 * every one of the 8 mirrors.
 *
 * ## One of the 13 is not mirrored, deliberately
 *
 * `TreeViewSchema.onNodeClick` is INVOKED (`schema.onNodeClick(node)`), not read
 * as a value. A function cannot appear in an authored JSON document, so it is a
 * runtime slot; objectui#6152 ruled that class never gets a zod mirror and is
 * recorded in `zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`'s `RuntimeOnlyDeclared` instead. Its
 * assertions below are the mirror-image of the other twelve: declared on the TS
 * face, ABSENT from the mirror shape, and pinned as a call signature.
 *
 * ## The read sites are pinned, not just described
 *
 * A declaration is worth its doc comment only while the read exists — and the
 * card's own rule is that a key whose reader was removed must be DROPPED, never
 * declared. So each entry carries the renderer file and the exact source text of
 * its read, checked off disk (the form `base-bind-declared.test.ts` uses). Line
 * numbers drift and are therefore in prose only; the READ is the fact.
