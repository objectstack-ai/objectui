  // minor-unit count of the resolved currency: 2 for USD / CNY, 0 for JPY,
  // 3 for KWD. With no currency resolved there is no minor unit to ask about,
  // so the historical 2 stays — the same no-currency fallback `formatCurrency`
  // uses for the grid cell.
  //
  // ⛔ NOT the field-level `precision`. `@objectstack/spec` declares it as
  // "Total digits (non-negative integer)" — the `p` of a decimal(p, s) column,
  // so a DECIMAL(18,2) amount is `precision: 18, scale: 2`. This widget used
  // to pass it straight to both `Intl` bounds (objectui#4361's "authored
  // `precision` wins"), which rendered a `precision: 18` amount with eighteen
  // decimal places; the ruling names that reading as wrong.
  //
  // ⛔ NOT `scale` either: the ruling on objectstack-ai/objectstack#19629
  // (letter B) takes `scale` off the `currency` type — refused at parse once
  // the spec ships it — and `CurrencyFieldMetadata` in `@object-ui/types`
  // does not declare it. Nor `currencyConfig.precision`, which the
  // objectstack#19910 ruling records as read by nothing and which this widget
  // has never read.
  //
  // This is the widget's ONE width, so the derivation also reaches the edit
  // affordances below. Deliberate: leaving `step`/blur-rounding at 2 would give
  // a JPY field that displays whole yen while offering a 0.01 spinner step and

   * ⚠️ What `e.target.value` can actually hold here — MEASURED in a real
   * browser, not inferred from the spec (objectui#6765).
   *
   * Both edit paths below read the box with a bare `parseFloat` and no
   * whole-string guard of their own. That is deliberate, and it is NOT the
   * objectui#6715 defect wearing a different hat. This is a `type="number"`
   * input, and a real browser never exposes non-numeric residue through
   * `.value`: keystrokes and pastes are filtered before the change event, and
   * the HTML value-sanitization algorithm keeps the value either wholly a
   * valid floating-point number or the empty string.
   *
   * Measured on Chromium 141.0.7390.37 (Playwright 1.62.1), driving THIS
   * widget through the routes a user actually has:
   *
   * ```
   * typed  "12abc" -> box.value "12"    onChange(12)
   * pasted "12abc" -> box.value "12"    onChange(12)
   * typed  "1.2.3" -> box.value "1.23"  onChange(1.23)
   * pasted "0x10"  -> box.value "010"   onChange(10)
   * typed  "1e"    -> box.value ""      onChange(null)   validity.badInput
   * ```
   *
   * ⛔ So objectui#6715's anchored `WHOLE_NUMBER_TEXT` is deliberately NOT
   * copied here. It would accept every string this box can produce and reject
   * only strings the TEST environment fabricates — happy-dom does not
   * implement the sanitization (`input.value = '12abc'` stays `'12abc'`), so a
   * unit test that fires a `change` carrying residue drives a path no browser
   * takes. Adding the guard would buy nothing in the product and would pin a
   * truncation no user reaches. The oracle-vs-product table is pinned in
   * `__tests__/NumberInputWidgets.environmentDivergence.test.tsx`.
   *
   * ⭐ CLOSED for the last row (objectui#6780, ruled 2026-08-29): the silent
   * drop is now ANNOUNCED, through `validity.badInput` — the platform's own
   * predicate — across all four `type="number"` widgets of this package as one
   * change. See `numberBadInput.tsx` for the measurement and for why the
   * emission itself is deliberately unchanged.
   *
   * ⛔ STILL SILENT, and deliberately so: the TRUNCATING rows above. `1.2.3`
   * stores `1.23` and `0x10` stores `10`, and no widget-side guard can refuse
   * them — the browser filtered the keystrokes before `handleChange` ran, so
   * the information is gone before any code here can see it. Only abandoning
   * `type="number"` would recover it, which the same ruling declined (it would
   * reverse objectui#2572's min/max/step and mobile-keyboard affordances).
   * ⚠️ This asymmetry is documented for USERS, not just here — a control that
   * warns about `1e` but silently truncates `1.2.3` teaches people that no
   * warning means the value is right. See `content/docs/guide/fields.md`.
