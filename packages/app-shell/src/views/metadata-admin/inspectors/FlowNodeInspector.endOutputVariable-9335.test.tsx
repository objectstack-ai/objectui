/**
 * objectui#9335 — the flow `end` group offered an "Output variable" control
 * writing `config.outputVariable`, a key `EndConfigSchema` refuses BY NAME.
 *
 * `EndConfigSchema` is a STRICT object whose entire key surface is `outcome`
 * and `message`. Anything an author typed in that box therefore produced a
 * document the loader refuses (`unrecognized_keys` at parse, a 422 on save) —
 * the control could only ever make a flow unloadable, and the form gave the
 * author no way to tell which of the group's two rows had done it.
 *
 * The repair is a REMOVAL, not a lenient path: Commandment #0.1 forbids the
 * renderer growing tolerance around a contract, and adding the key to the spec
 * is a different lane. `outputVariable` is real product vocabulary — it is just
 * not an `end` node's, and an `end` node terminates rather than producing a
 * value to bind.
 *
 * ## What makes each reading a reading rather than a dead probe
 *
 * Every negative below is paired with a lit control differing in exactly one
 * way, because a zero whose control is also dead proves nothing:
 *
 *  - the spec rows print BOTH signs from one parse: `{outcome:'completed'}` is
 *    ACCEPTED in the same reading in which the `outputVariable` rows are
 *    refused, so the refusals are not a schema that refuses everything.
 *  - the descriptor absence is paired with the SAME lookup finding `outcome`
 *    and `message` in the SAME group — so the group did not go empty.
 *  - the rendered absence is paired with the IDENTICAL query finding an
 *    "Output variable" control on a `script` node one render away — so the null
 *    is a removal scoped to `end`, not a renderer that drew nothing and not a
 *    query that can never match (objectui#8350's lesson).
 *  - the "other groups keep theirs" sweep asserts a NON-EMPTY set, so "`end` is
 *    not in it" cannot pass by the set being empty.
 *
 * ## Why no `__legacy__` render-only row was left behind
 *
 * That treatment (`condition` on `decision`, the retired `script` keys) is for
 * keys the schema ACCEPTS and the runtime ignores — showing them costs nothing
 * because the document still loads. A key the schema REFUSES is different: a
 * stored one is already unloadable, and it is NOT hidden by the descriptor's
 * absence. An unowned config key falls through to the Advanced (JSON) block,
 * which auto-opens when non-empty — pinned below, together with the clear.
 *
 * ## The un-hiding (objectui#9336, which has landed)
 *
 * An unrecognized key short-circuits `EndConfigSchema`'s `superRefine`: while
 * this box existed, a `refused` end that used it reported ONLY
 * `unrecognized_keys` and NEVER the missing-`message` refusal. So this defect
 * MASKED objectui#9336's contract. Both halves of that masking are read off the
 * installed spec below.
 *
 * ⛔ Every expectation about what the schema accepts is derived from the
 * installed `EndConfigSchema` at run time, never from a literal restated here.
