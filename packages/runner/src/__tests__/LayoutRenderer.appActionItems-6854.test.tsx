/**
 * `LayoutRenderer` renders `AppAction.items` from the DECLARED element type and
 * nothing else (objectui#6854, maintainer ruling of 2026-09-05, option B2).
 *
 * `AppAction.items` is `AppMenuItem[]` — `type` / `label` / `icon` / `path` /
 * `href` / `children` / `badge` / `hidden` — and the zod mirror parses it with
 * the legacy `MenuItemSchema`, which drops anything else in silence, `shortcut`
 * excepted since objectui#7719 (see the note below). This map used to reach two
 * keys that are on neither authorable list through `as any`: `onClick` and
 * `shortcut`.
 *
 * Deleting them is what makes `AppActionSchema.onClick`'s refusal message true
 * again. It tells an author "no renderer reads this key, so nothing could ever
 * run it", and until this ruling one did — the three-layer contradiction the
 * card was filed for (`?: never` on the type, "nobody reads it" from the
 * validator, a renderer reading it).
 *
 * These assertions author BOTH undeclared keys anyway — exactly what a host
 * bypassing the validator would hand in, which the card's Zone-2 census found
 * none of in this repo — and require the renderer to ignore both. Re-adding
 * either read turns one of them red.
 *
 * ⭐ THE RULING THIS NOTE USED TO BE WAITING FOR HAS LANDED. This paragraph read
 * "⛔ NOT a ruling that `shortcut` must stay unrendered for ever: whether it
 * should become AUTHORABLE on `AppAction.items` is its own contract card" —
 * that card is objectui#7719, and director seat decision batch #70 of
 * 2026-09-07 answered it: `shortcut` does NOT become authorable here, and ⛔ no
 * read is re-added in this renderer. What that card changed is the DIAGNOSTIC on
 * the types side — `shortcut?: never` on `AppMenuItem` and a named refusal on
 * `MenuItemSchema`, so an authored value is refused by name instead of stripped
 * in silence, pinned in
 * `packages/types/src/__tests__/app-menu-item-shortcut-refusal-7719.test.ts`.
 * ⇒ The assertions below are unchanged BY THAT RULING, which says the #6854 pin
 * stays as is. They now pin a settled contract rather than an interim state.
 *
 * The `packages/types` half of the same claim — that the refusal message still
 * makes it — is pinned in
 * `packages/types/src/__tests__/app-action-onclick-refusal-6854.test.ts`.
