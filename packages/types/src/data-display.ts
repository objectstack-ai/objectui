 *
 * Three outcomes, and the third is the load-bearing one:

 *   42 out-of-union spec field types (`select`, `lookup`, `user`, `file`,

 *   only consumer that reads this key: `data-table`'s inline editor branches on
 *   `date` / `datetime` / the numeric set and otherwise falls through to a text
 *   input — which is exactly the `undefined` path. The dedicated widget those
 *   fields DO get is chosen by the host's `renderCellEditor`, which resolves the
 *   field through `column.accessorKey` and never reads `type`. Mapping them to

   * `str(raw.chartType) ??` left all green; deleting `?? str(raw.type)` went
   * 2 red. The card's readings, re-taken, agree.
   *
   * The spec's `ChartSeriesSchema` lists `chartType` in its alias map as a
   * spelling of `type` and refuses it by name — "Did you mean `chartType` →
   * `type`?" — and this face answers with the same sentence
   * (`aliasKeyRefusal()` in `zod/tombstone.zod.ts`). The two alternatives were

   * writable name would mint the N-dialects hazard of AGENTS.md #0.1 against
   * the spec's own alias map.
   *
   * Until this declaration the non-strict Zod mirror STRIPPED the key in
   * silence: `{ name: 'x', chartType: 'line' }` parsed green to `{ name: 'x' }`
   * and the series drew in the chart's family — precisely what the author was
   * overriding. Now the mirror refuses it by name and this `?: never` is a

 * adopted on objectui#6172: **the exported type aligns to the measured
 * authored + read set.** Before that ruling this interface declared `events` /
 * `orientation` / `position` and nothing else, and the divergence was
 * invisible to `tsc` because {@link BaseSchema} carries `[key: string]: any` —
 * every key the renderer reads resolved as `any`, so `schema: TimelineSchema`
 * constrained nothing. (The index signature itself is objectui#5155 /
 * objectui#6269, deliberately not touched here.)
 *
 * Measured on `origin/main` @ `79ebf30d1`: `TimelineRenderer`
 * (`plugin-timeline/src/renderer.tsx:250`) reads NINE keys off this node —
 * `variant`, `items`, `dateFormat`, `onItemClick`, `minDate`, `maxDate`,
 * `rowLabel`, `scale`, `timeScale` — and NONE of `events` / `orientation` /
 * `position`. EIGHT of those nine are declared below; `onItemClick` is not, on
 * purpose — it is a runtime slot `ObjectTimeline` installs when it composes
 * this schema, not authorable metadata, and this package's convention keeps
 * callback-shaped keys off the authored surface (see `RuntimeOnlyDeclared` in
 * `__tests__/zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`). That measurement is a dated record
 * and is kept as one: `timeScale` has since been RETIRED (objectui#6355,
 * ruling 2026-08-27), so the read set is EIGHT keys today and `scale` is the
 * sole axis spelling. The registration's own `inputs` metadata and
 * `content/docs/plugins/plugin-timeline.mdx`'s property table agreed with the
 * renderer all along; only this type disagreed — including with the docs
 * page's own TypeScript example, which did not compile, because `events` was
 * required and nothing writes it.
 *
 * ## Two timelines, and this is the presentational one
 *
 * `TimelineSchema` describes HOW TO DRAW a rail from items already in hand.

 * consumed by `ObjectTimeline`, which resolves those field names against
 * fetched records and composes the presentational shape below before handing

/**

 * objectui#6349. They were not a second dialect, they were a stale COPY: a
 * strict subset of the navigation declarations, missing `BreadcrumbItem.icon` /
 * `onClick` / `siblings` and `BreadcrumbSchema.maxItems`, with no key declared
 * differently on either side. Everything that actually reads a breadcrumb was
 * already on the navigation declaration — `registry.ts` maps the `'breadcrumb'`
 * component type to it, `packages/types/src/index.ts` re-exports it under the
 * bare names, `zod/navigation.zod.ts` mirrors it, and
 * `content/docs/components/data-display/breadcrumb.mdx` documents `icon` and
 * `maxItems` on THIS page. The copy's only reach was the
 * `@object-ui/types/data-display` subpath and the {@link DataDisplaySchema}
 * union below, both of which under-declared what the renderer honours.
 *
 * A re-export is one declaration with a second export site, which is exactly
 * how this monorepo is meant to fan a type out; the recurrence guard
 * (`scripts/__tests__/one-authority-per-exported-name-6273.test.ts`) does not
 * count it. 2026-08-25 family ruling, objectui#6172 decision 甲/A1.
