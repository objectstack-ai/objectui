/**
 * objectui#8883 — `record:reference_rail` compiles its parent scope by the
 * relationship field's ARITY, and refuses to render a "View All" link it
 * cannot express.
 *
 * The rail took an author-supplied `relationshipField` and compiled it as bare
 * equality TWICE, in two different grammars: the `$filter` it puts on the wire
 * and the `filter[<field>]=<value>` URL its "View All" link points at. On a
 * `multiple: true` relationship the stored value is an ARRAY of parent ids, so
 * equality asks whether that whole array IS one id — which `driver-sql`
 * refuses with `400 INVALID_FILTER` while prescribing `$contains`.
 *
 * ## Two halves, two different answers
 *
 * The `$filter` half is repairable and is repaired: it goes through
 * `composeParentScopeFilter` from `@object-ui/core`, the ONE compiler the
 * related list's rows (objectui#7299) and its tab badge (objectui#8882)
 * already share, whose verdict is `@objectstack/spec/data`'s own
 * `isMultiValueField`.
 *
 * The LINK half is not repairable at this layer and is not repaired: no URL
 * spelling on this surface carries membership, so the link is SUPPRESSED on a
 * multi-value relationship rather than pointed at an unscoped child table.
 * Landing the filter alone would have produced a rail that shows the right
 * rows above a link that goes somewhere else — a disagreement invisible until
 * the user clicks. Both halves are pinned below, and so is the LINK's
 * survival on the single-value arm that was already correct.
 *
 * ## Why the fake backend REFUSES equality instead of answering it
 *
 * The defect is invisible to a permissive backend: a fake that answers bare
 * equality against an array-valued column with "no rows" turns a driver-level
 * refusal into a plausible empty rail, and one that answers with the rows
 * makes the bug look like a working feature. Either way every assertion here
 * would be satisfied by the broken filter. The evaluator below therefore
 * throws on that exact combination — and on any filter shape it does not
 * recognise — and `FIXTURE` asserts that it does, in both directions.
