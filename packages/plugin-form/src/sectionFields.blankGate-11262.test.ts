/**
 * objectui#11262 — `attachVisibility` diagnoses the blank view-level predicate
 * it drops (ADR-0137 D4: a gate predicate that is blank is "diagnosed, never a
 * silent `true`").
 *
 * `sectionFields.ts` is where every sectioned `object-form` arm (and, through
 * `SectionFieldsContext.pool`, the default arm) turns an authored section entry
 * into a runtime field. A blank predicate — a string, or an envelope whose
 * `source` is blank — never reached the runtime field's `visibleOn` slot, so the
 * form renderer, which reports a blank predicate it evaluates, never saw it: the
 * field was drawn with no gate and nothing said the author's gate was empty.
 * That verdict stands ("no gate"); only the silence ends.
 *
 * Every chain that reaches `attachVisibility` is pinned, because each reads a
 * different key: the object schema's `visible_on ?? visibleOn` behind a name
 * string, a spec form-view entry's `visibleWhen ?? visibleOn`, and an
 * already-built runtime field's own `visibleOn`. The last one is the exception
 * the card's reading did not draw: that field IS the output, so its blank is
 * not dropped at all. It reaches the form renderer, which evaluates it and
 * reports it (the `form.tsx` pin "a blank view-level visibleOn is a layout
 * GATE: no gate plus a diagnostic" in `visibleWhen-fault-refuses-submit-8069`),
 * so its rows pin that it is carried unchanged and NOT reported a second time.
 *
 * Field names are unique per row: the one-time warning dedupe is module state
 * in `@object-ui/core`, keyed on the predicate text and the locator (which names
 * the field), and the `unit` project shares one module graph per worker.
