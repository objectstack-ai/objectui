/**
 * A dataset filter built with `After` on a date column reads back as an
 * operator that column offers (objectui#9382).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `OP_TO_MONGO` writes `$gt` for BOTH `greaterThan` and `after`, and the spec's
 * filter vocabulary has one token for "strictly greater" — there is no
 * `$after`. So the stored filter is correct and filters correctly; what the
 * fixed read-back table lost was the LABEL. A `$gt` came back as `greaterThan`,
 * which the date bucket does not list, and Radix draws a blank trigger for a
 * value no mounted item carries.
 *
 * ## DIRECTION, predicted before running
 *
 * On the pre-fix tree:
 *
 *   - `the operator a date column reads back is one it offers` — RED, for
 *     `after` and `before`, on each of `date` / `datetime` / `time`;
 *   - `the panel names the operator the author picked` — RED, trigger is `""`;
 *   - `every pair the dropdown can build survives the round trip` — RED on
 *     exactly those 6 pairs and green on the other 116;
 *   - everything under `controls` and `boundaries the repair must not cross` —
 *     GREEN in both directions, by construction. They are not pins: a suite
 *     built only on them could not fail.
 *
 * ## The control this card's own body insists on
 *
 * `greaterThan` IS a member of the number bucket. That is what makes "the date
 * bucket does not contain it" a reading about DATES rather than a lookup that
 * answers `false` for everything, and it is asserted here rather than assumed.
 * The same guard runs on the identity of the answers: the round trip must yield
 * a NON-EMPTY operator and the bucket must be NON-EMPTY, so the membership test
 * can never pass by comparing two absences.
