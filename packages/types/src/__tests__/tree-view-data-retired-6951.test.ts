/**
 * Retirement pin — `TreeViewSchema.data` is REFUSED on both published faces and
 * no longer READ by the renderer (objectui#6951 B1, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).
 * Maintainer ruling B1 of 2026-09-04: retire `data`; `nodes` is the only inline
 * spelling; `nodes` stays OPTIONAL; no presence refinement.
 *
 * ## What was measured before the retirement
 *
 * `TreeViewSchema` declared two spellings for its one inline-nodes slot —
 * `nodes` (read second) and `data` (read third, after a `bind`-resolved value
 * and after `nodes`) — both declared by objectui#6150. `data` had been REQUIRED
 * until objectui#6939 / PR #7533 made it optional, which is the state this
 * retirement starts from. Corpus at the retirement: four catalog entries plus
 * the nested tree in `components-complex-resizable/editor-interface.json` on
 * `nodes`; `packages/types/examples/data-display-examples.json` and the
 * `content/docs/api/schema-reference.md` fence on `data` — both rewritten to
 * `nodes`; no package source authored either.
 *
 * ## The trap this pin exists to keep visible — `BaseSchema.data`
 *
 * `BaseSchema` declares `data?: any` (`z.any().optional()` on the mirror) and is
 * `.passthrough()`. So DELETING the member from `TreeViewSchema` would not
 * refuse an authored `data`: the key would be ADMITTED, unvalidated, through
 * the base member — and with the renderer no longer reading it, drawn as an
 * empty tree. The retirement therefore has to be a tombstone on the EXTENDED
 * schema that SHADOWS the base member, and the fact that it does is not
 * assumed here — it is measured: the base alone accepts the very document the
 * extended schema refuses (the "base control" below), on both faces.
 *
 * ## What the ruling deliberately did NOT do
 *
 * No `nodes`-required, no "at least one of `nodes` / `data`" refinement:
 * `{ type: 'tree-view', bind: 'treeNodes' }` is a legal, RENDERING document
 * (`packages/components/src/renderers/__tests__/shadowed-renderer-behaviour.test.tsx`),
 * because `bind` is the FIRST source the renderer reads. A two-limb presence
 * rule would refuse it. So `bind`-only and `nodes`-only both parse below, and
 * so does a bare `{ type: 'tree-view' }` — the same document class PR #7533
 * made legal, unchanged.
 *
 * The `@ts-expect-error` directives are REAL enforcement: this package
 * type-checks its tests through `tsconfig.test.json`, so re-widening the
 * declaration fails the build on the unused directive. A green `vitest` run is
 * NOT evidence about them — type assertions are erased before it runs.
