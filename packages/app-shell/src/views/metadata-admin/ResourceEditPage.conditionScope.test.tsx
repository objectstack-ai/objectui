/**
 * The generic editor really DERIVES its condition scope from the metadata type
 * it is editing — objectui#8167, the production edge, witnessed.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at all
 *
 * `ConditionWidget.conditionScope.test.tsx` pins two halves and leaves the seam
 * between them unobserved:
 *
 *   • the WIDGET honours a `conditionScope` it is handed (driven with a
 *     hand-built `WidgetContext`), and
 *   • the TABLE holds the ruled verdict for each tier (read through
 *     `conditionScopeForMetadataType`).
 *
 * Neither one watches the line that JOINS them — `ResourceEditPage`'s
 * `conditionScope: conditionScopeForMetadataType(type)`. A hard-coded
 * `'flattened'` there would compile and leave every one of those cases green,
 * because none of them mounts the host. That is this card's own defect one
 * layer up: a verdict nothing honours, with nothing to notice.
 *
 * So this case mounts the REAL host and reads the REAL engine's answer at the
 * far end. The only stand-ins are the metadata client and the type registry —
 * the network and the server's schema row, which are nobody's contract here.
 * Everything between the host and the verdict is production code: the real
 * derivation, the real `WidgetContext`, the real `SchemaForm` routing by name
 * convention, the real `ConditionWidget`, the real `ConditionBuilder`, and the
 * real `@objectstack/formula`.
 *
 * ## Why a hook
 *
 * `hook`'s ruled verdict is `record`, and it is a type this host renders
 * through its GENERIC form: `hook` has no registered preview, so
 * `ResourceEditPage` takes its plain-form branch — the branch that hands the
 * derived `WidgetContext` to `SchemaForm`. The curated `HookDefaultInspector`
 * (which landed the same verdict at its own mount in objectui#9643) lives on
 * the canvas branch and is not what runs here.
 *
 * ⚠️ Its server schema row is a fixture. That is the honest part to name: this
 * case pins the DERIVATION, not which keys a hook's published schema carries.
