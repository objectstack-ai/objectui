/**
 * objectui#3096 — the toolbar sort picker stops offering relational fields.
 *
 * This view's sort leaves as a server `$orderby` on the flat field name, so
 * picking `owner` ordered the whole collection by the stored foreign-key id
 * while the column showed people's names. The server cannot order by the
 * related record's name without a join (objectstack#4256 settled that it
 * won't), so the picker no longer offers the illusion — and says why.
 *
 * A relational field the CURRENT sort already uses stays listed (flagged as
 * ordering by ID) so a view authored or saved with such a sort round-trips
 * instead of rendering a blank row and losing the sort on the next edit.
