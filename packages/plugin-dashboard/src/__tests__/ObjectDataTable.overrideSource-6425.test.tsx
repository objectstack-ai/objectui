/**
 * The CONSUMER half of `declared = enforced` for `ObjectDataTable`'s column
 * seam (objectui#6425). `ObjectDataTable.emitBoundary-6373.test.tsx` is its
 * twin from the other end: that one asks what the producer WRITES into the
 * `TableColumn[]` slot, this one asks what it READS off the authored column.
 *
 * `enrich()` handed `buildFieldMeta` six values taken off the authored column.
 * Five — `format`, `options`, `referenceTo`, `currency`, `decimals` — are
 * declared by neither `TableColumn` nor its `TableColumnSchema` zod mirror.
 * Three arrived through `(col as any)`; the other two through
 * `NormalizedColumn`'s `[key: string]: any`, which answers `any` just as
 * loudly without the tell. `AuthoredColumnOverrides` replaces both with a
 * written hold per key plus a derived refusal band.
 *
 * ## The ruling landed — this file now pins the ruled state
 *
 * This suite began as the PREREQUISITE for the declare-or-retire ruling: the
 * runtime half measures, per key, whether an authored override reaches
 * anything at all, so the ruling could be made on evidence. The maintainer
 * ruled per key on 2026-08-27 (objectui#6425): `format` / `options` /
 * `currency` DECLARED on `TableColumn` + its zod mirror; `decimals` RETIRED
 * immediately (the authored read is gone; the key is refused — since
 * objectui#6625 by an explicit tombstone rather than by the derived band,
 * because that card retired the `FieldMeta` member the band derived it from);
 * `referenceTo` routed to objectui#6597 (⛔ not declared as spelled, and not
 * decided here — a HELD key needed a demand MEASUREMENT the per-key ruling
 * itself could not make). objectui#6597 measured no authoring story and
 * RETIRED it too, the same mechanism as `decimals`: refused by an explicit
 * tombstone since the key left `keyof FieldMeta`. The measurements below are
 * unchanged because neither ruling changed behaviour; what changed is which
 * artefact answers for each key.
 *
 * ## Every zero here is paired with a positive control
 *
 * Two of the five reach no reader. A test that renders two columns and finds
 * them equal proves that only if the SAME query shape is shown separating two
 * columns elsewhere — otherwise it is measuring a broken harness. So each
 * inert pair sits next to a live pair built the same way: `decimals` against
 * `currency`, `referenceTo` against `options`.
