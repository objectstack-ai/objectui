/**
 * What the `summaryFields` chip beside the record H1 draws for an OBJECT value
 * (objectui#8464).
 *
 * ## The defect, reproduced before it was fixed
 *
 * The chip's display was `String(val)` with four families special-cased, so an
 * object-valued summary field printed the literal `[object Object]` next to the
 * page title — and, because the chip's accessible name is built from the SAME
 * string, in its accessible name too. Measured on `ed971e8fc`, before the fix,
 * with `summaryFields: ['owner_ref','billing_address','office_location']`:
 *
 *   chip text `[object Object]`  aria-label `owner_ref: [object Object]`
 *   chip text `[object Object]`  aria-label `billing_address: [object Object]`
 *   chip text `[object Object]`  aria-label `office_location: [object Object]`
 *
 * Reachable both ways the card names: `schema.summaryFields` is author-declared
 * and never filtered by type, and the auto-detection can hand the status slot to
 * a field whose stored value is not a scalar.
 *
 * ## Which question this chip asks — MEASURED, not argued
 *
 * objectui#8395 established on this exact page that "render what the user sees"
 * and "render the underlying value" give different answers per field type, and
 * that the intuitive choice was wrong for 9 of 17 types. That table is about a
 * CLIPBOARD payload. This chip is a display surface, and its own existing
 * behaviour answers which side it is on — re-derived against this tree:
 *
 * | field    | stored                       | chip prints            |
 * |----------|------------------------------|------------------------|
 * | currency | `1234.5`                     | `$1,235`               |
 * | date     | `'2026-03-04'`               | `Mar 4, 2026`          |
 * | datetime | `'2024-07-04T07:00:00.000Z'` | `Jul 4, 2024, 7:00 AM` |
 * | select   | `'won'`                      | `Closed Won`           |
 *
 * Every one is the SEEN face, never the stored one. So the display authority for
 * a kind the chip does not format is that kind's own cell renderer — option A,
 * the way `HeaderHighlight` reads it one band below. The four rows above are
 * pinned in `THE FOUR FORMATTED FAMILIES` and are RED for routing every value
 * through the cell renderer regardless of kind.
 *
 * ## …and where a pill cannot host one
 *
 * A Badge is a much smaller surface than a cell. 15 of the 53 registered types
 * draw a nested pill, an avatar composite, a bare `<img>` with no text, or a
 * "No value" face for a value `hasCellValue` just called FILLED. The full table
 * and its instrument are `summaryChip.badgeFitCensus-8464.test.tsx`; the set is
 * `../summaryChipRenderers`. Those kinds take `coerceToSafeValue`, this repo's
 * single answer to the same question — ⛔ never a stringifier written for this
 * chip (objectui#8395's option C, "answer-shopping").
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT moved
 *
 * ⭐ The chip's EMPTINESS classification. objectui#8394 / PR #8457 converged it
 * onto `hasCellValue` as "the non-regressive convergence — it moves
 * whitespace-only strings and nothing else". This card is a DISPLAY decision;
 * `THE EMPTINESS CLASSIFICATION` below re-pins all four of its answers through
 * the chip, so a display change that quietly re-classified a value is red here.
 *
 * ## Instruments
 *
 * ⚠️ **Four expected NAMES here moved in objectui#8729, and the reason is
 *   worth keeping.** That card made this chip resolve the field's label through
 *   `fieldLabel` — the call `HeaderHighlight` and `DetailSection` already make —
 *   instead of printing the raw stored column. So a fixture whose authored
 *   label differs from its stored name now announces the label:
 *   `status: Negotiation` → `Status: Negotiation`, `owner:` → `Owner:`,
 *   `stage:` → `Stage:`, `ratio:` → `Ratio:`. ⭐ THIS CARD'S SUBJECT DID NOT
 *   MOVE: the VALUE half of every one of those strings is byte-identical, and
 *   the whole `RENDERER_BACKED` table below is untouched down to the byte
 *   because it declares `label: field` — the two spellings coincide there, so
 *   the naming change is invisible to it, which is itself the measurement that
 *   the change is confined to the name.
 *
 * - Chips are navigated by `[data-summary-chip="<field>"]`, added by this change
 *   so a renderer-backed chip (which carries no `aria-label` — see below) has the
 *   same handle as a string one. ⚠️ NOT by `queryByText`, which throws on
 *   MULTIPLE matches as well as none, and every summary value also renders in the
 *   body grid.
 * - ⚠️ Nested pills are counted by CLASS TOKEN over `chip.querySelectorAll('*')`,
 *   never by `querySelector`. `.rounded-full` matches TWO nodes per avatar (Radix
 *   `Avatar.Root` AND `AvatarFallback`); a `querySelector` navigation cannot see
 *   that, counting can, and `USER` below asserts the exact count.
 * - A renderer-backed chip carries no `aria-label`: `aria-label` OVERRIDES
 *   content, so it would hide the very value the branch exists to show. Its
 *   accessible name is composed from content instead — an `sr-only` field-name
 *   prefix plus the renderer's text — which is why `textContent` reads
 *   `field: value` for those chips and bare `value` for string ones.
