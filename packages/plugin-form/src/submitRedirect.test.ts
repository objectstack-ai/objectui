 *
 * `resolveSubmitRedirect` — objectui#4989, against the shape objectstack#7496
 * ruled and objectstack#7657 landed in `@objectstack/spec` (17.0.0 GA).
 *
 * ## What is pinned here, and what it is pinned AGAINST
 *
 * The module asks the spec's schema for its shape verdict instead of restating
 * the rule, so a table of hand-written expectations would pin this file's opinion
 * rather than the contract. Both accept/refuse suites therefore use the REAL
 * `FormViewSchema` as the oracle — `specAccepts()` below is the same parse an
 * authoring door performs — and assert that the two verdicts agree. That makes
 * these tests a drift detector for the contract, not for a copy of it: if a later
 * spec release widens or narrows the ruled shape, they follow it, and they fail
 * only if this renderer and the door ever disagree about one value.
 *
 * The strong pin is `emits a url the contract still accepts`: ruling point 2
 * requires every interpolated value to be URL-escaped when the redirect is built,
 * so the oracle is turned on the OUTPUT — whatever this module emits, hostile
 * record values and all, must still be a value the contract would accept.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification — predicted first, then measured (counts are measured)
 *
 * Deleting the `encodeURIComponent` (interpolating the raw value) turns **8 tests
 * in this file** red (10 counting the two component files), and WHICH assertion
 * catches each value is the part worth writing down, because re-parsing the
 * emitted string is necessary and **not sufficient**:
 *
 *   - the schema oracle catches only values whose raw form breaks the ruled shape
 *     ANYWHERE in the string — a backslash, whitespace, a control character.
 *     Those checks are not anchored to the start, so they still fire mid-path.
 *   - an address or a script scheme is NOT caught by it. Raw-interpolated,
 *     `/t/{{record.slug}}` becomes `/t/https://evil.example/steal`, which starts
 *     with `/` and carries no leading scheme — a perfectly spec-valid relative
 *     path that goes somewhere the author did not write. Only
 *     `toContain(encodeURIComponent(hostile))` sees that: the harm is injected
 *     path STRUCTURE, and relative-only has nothing to say about it.
 *   - a brace pair in the record trips the unresolved-interpolation backstop
 *     instead, refusing rather than emitting a token-bearing URL.
 *
 * So the two assertions in that block are not belt-and-braces; they cover
 * disjoint halves of "escaped enough".
 *
 * Replacing the spec's refusal message with a local hand-written sentence turns
 * **14 tests here** red — all 13 refusal families plus the external-alternative
 * case — while every accept case stays green. That is the load-bearing probe for
 * "the verdict is the contract's": a local re-implementation could reproduce the
 * ok/refuse BOOLEAN for every value in this table and still fail these, because
 * what they check is that the prose came from the schema.
 *
 * Deleting the CALL SITES instead (restoring the old same-origin guard in the
 * two components — `isSameOriginUrl`, deleted from `successBehavior.ts` by
 * objectui#5034 and spelled `new URL(u, location.href).origin ===
 * location.origin`) leaves this entire file GREEN — measured, not assumed: the module
 * would simply be correct and unused. That is why the consumption is pinned in the
 * two rendered-component files and not here.
 *
 * Control characters below are written as escape sequences on purpose — a raw one
 * makes the whole file read as binary to grep, and this repo has paid for that
 * four times.

/**
 * A refusal CITES THE RULING it comes from, in either spelling the spec uses.
 *
 * ⚠️ This file was the odd one out (objectui#7122 contract review). Its three
 * siblings — `WizardForm.submitRedirect.test.tsx`,
 * `ObjectForm.submitRedirect.test.tsx` and the console's
 * `submitRedirect.test.ts` — all assert this SHAPE, while this one pinned the
 * literal `'ruled 2026-08-11'`. That is the same defect the re-point was
 * supposed to remove, moved one word along: it swapped a brittle `#7496` for a
 * brittle date, and the four files disagreed about what the property even is.
 *
 * The property is that the sentence on screen carries its governing ruling in a
 * machine-recognisable form, which is what proves it came from the schema and
 * not from a local hand-written string (the load-bearing mutation probe in this
 * file's header — "replacing the spec's refusal message … turns 14 tests red" —
 * depends on exactly that).
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why there is no bare `#\d{3,}` alternative
 *
 * The sibling files' first spelling was
 * `/\(ruled \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\)|#\d{3,}/` — two alternatives, to admit
 * either form upstream uses. The loose half discriminated NOTHING: this repo's
 * own hand-written messages routinely cite `objectui#NNNN`, so a locally
 * authored sentence satisfied it, and telling those two apart is this
 * assertion's entire job.
 *
 * It was also unnecessary, which is the measurement that settled it. Both
 * spellings, read off the installed artifacts rather than recalled:
 *
 *   17.2.0  "… and this is an absolute URL (ruled 2026-08-11 on #7496)."
 *   17.3.0  "… and this is an absolute URL (ruled 2026-08-11)."
 *
 * The issue number never appears OUTSIDE that parenthesis, so `(ruled ` + a
 * date already matched both releases on its own. The optional ` on #NNNN` tail
 * keeps the 17.2.0 spelling admissible without admitting a bare local `#7122`.
