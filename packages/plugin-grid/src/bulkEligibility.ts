/**
 * Per-record `visible` eligibility for a bulk action (objectui#3067).
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A bulk def's `visible` is evaluated **once per selected record, with that
 * record in scope** — the same binding and the same fail-closed contract the
 * row kebab uses (`useRowPredicate(..., { fallback: false })`). From that one
 * evaluation both questions are answered:
 *
 *   - **Is the button offered?** Yes when at least one selected record passes.
 *     A record-free predicate (`features.x`, `current_user.y`) returns the same
 *     verdict for every row, so it behaves exactly like a button-level gate —
 *     no need to detect whether the author referenced `record`.
 *   - **Which records does it run on?** The ones that passed. The rest are
 *     reported as skipped rather than silently included.
 *
 * ## What this replaces
 *
 * The bar used to evaluate `visible` against the ambient scope with no record
 * bound, on the lenient path. That does not fail open — it returns `true` for
 * *every* row-scoped predicate, including the ones that should be false:
 * `${record.done}` and `${record.owner == user.id}` both evaluated `true` with
 * no record in scope. So an authored gate was not weakened, it was inverted for
 * half its inputs, and nothing distinguished that from a real verdict.
 *
 * The mechanism predates objectui#3002, but only inline-authored
 * `bulkActionDefs[].visible` used to reach it — written by authors who knew
 * there was no record. #3031 began promoting object actions into the bar, and
 * their `visible` is typically written for a row/record surface, which is what
 * made row-scoped predicates land in a record-free evaluation.

 * same definition {@link partitionRowsByPredicate} asks for the fold, so the
 * button and the fold behind it cannot disagree about one def.
 *
 * The bar reads it because "no record qualified" only means "hide me" for a def
 * that gated itself; an ungated def renders regardless. Truthiness cannot
 * answer this: `visible: false` is a declared gate that excludes everything,
 * and testing `def.visible &&` classified it as *ungated* — which rendered the
 * button `false` was written to remove (objectui#3492).
 *
 * Blank is not declared: `''`, a whitespace-only string and an envelope whose
 * `source` is blank are all "no gate", as on the row menu and the toolbars.
 * This used to be a test of its own, `!= null && !== ''`, so a whitespace-only
 * `visible` counted as a gate here, every record failed it, and the selection
 * bar hid an action the rest of the grid showed (objectui#11322).
