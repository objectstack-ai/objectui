/**
 * ⭐ THE DECLARED LOOKUP LEGS REACH THE PICKER — objectui#7435.
 *
 * ## The defect, stated as what the author saw
 *
 * `resolveActionParams`' picker group read the resolved object-schema field def
 * in `snake_case` ONLY. `field` there is a `getObjectSchema` / `useMetadata()`
 * document, which serves the spec's camelCase spelling — so a field declaring
 * `displayField` / `descriptionField` / `lookupFilters` had every one of those
 * values silently dropped, and the action param rendered with picker defaults.
 * No warning fired anywhere: the resolver simply read keys that were not there.
 *
 * ## What each case asserts, and why it is the resolved VALUE
 *
 * Two exits are read, never "the resolver ran":
 *
 *   1. `ActionParamDef` — what this resolver EMITS.
 *   2. the field object `paramToField()` hands `ActionParamDialog`, which is
 *      what `LookupField` actually consumes. A value that reaches (1) but is
 *      dropped at (2) is not a fix, and only the second exit can say so.
 *
 * Camel and snake fixtures carry DIFFERENT values on every key, so no assertion
 * can be satisfied by the wrong leg.
 *
 * ## Measured, on the pin this tree resolves
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec@17.4.0` — re-measured for this card, which asked for
 * exactly this re-run (its own correction was taken on 17.2.0).
 * `FieldSchema.safeParse` over a minimal lookup def ACCEPTS `displayField`,
 * `descriptionField` and `lookupFilters`, and REJECTS every snake twin with
 * `unrecognized_keys`. Controls lit in the same run: the minimal def ACCEPTED,
 * `zzz_not_a_real_key` REJECTED.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The two carve-outs are pinned as ABSENCES
 *
 * `idField` and `titleFormat` deliberately gain no camel leg — measured on the
 * same pin, `FieldSchema` refuses both exactly as it refuses their snake twins
 * (the spec's only `idField` is on `InlineGridColumnSchema`; `titleFormat` is an
 * object-level key under an ADR-0079 deprecation toward `nameField`). Adding a
 * read would fossilise a spelling no contract declares. That fence is stated in
 * prose in three places and enforced by nothing, so
 * {@link carveOuts} asserts it: a camel-authored `idField` / `titleFormat` must
 * NOT reach the param, while the snake read keeps working.
