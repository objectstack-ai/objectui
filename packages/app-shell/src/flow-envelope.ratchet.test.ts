 * #2958 ratchet — every flow `trigger` / `resume` caller goes through
 * `interpretFlowResponse`.
 *
 * The sibling of `actions-envelope.ratchet.test.ts`, for the same reason. The
 * rule for reading an `AutomationResult` lived in THREE hand-rolled copies —
 * the flow handlers in `useConsoleActionRuntime` and `RecordDetailView`, and
 * `FlowRunner`'s resume — and only the resume copy was complete. The two launch
 * copies validated the transport envelope and then treated everything else as
 * terminal success, so a run that failed on its first node was reported as a
 * completed one: no dialog, a green "completed successfully" toast, a refresh,
 * and the real error swallowed. One copy also passed the error value through
 * raw, where a nested `{code, message}` reaches `toast.error()` as a React child
 * and crashes the page (React #31).
 *
 * If this fails: don't hand-roll the check. Import `interpretFlowResponse` from
 * `utils/flowResponse` — it classifies transport failure / flow failure /
 * screen pause / terminal success, and guarantees a string error.
