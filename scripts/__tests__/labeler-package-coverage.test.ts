/**
 * objectui#7746: `.github/labeler.yml` had no `package: fields` entry, so every PR
 * touching `packages/fields` went unlabelled. Measured on PR #7621 (merged
 * 2026-09-05), which changes `packages/fields/src/index.tsx` and
 * `packages/fields/src/__tests__/datetime-compact-style-7443.test.tsx`: it carries
 * exactly `package: core`, `package: components` and `tests` — no fields label.
 *
 * The path labels are not decoration here: they are how a sweeping seat finds the PRs
 * that touch a package. A package whose PRs never get labelled is a package whose PRs
 * are invisible to any query keyed on `package: *` — and such a query returns a
 * confident, short, wrong answer rather than an error.
 *
 * `fields` was not the only one. Enumerating `packages/*` against the config found
 * **16 of 40** directories drawing no label at all, against a file that named
 * `package: *` for exactly four of them (`core`, `types`, `react`, `components`).
 * Twenty of the remaining directories are `plugin-*`, covered by the `plugin` family,
 * and `data-objectstack` is covered by `data-adapter` — which is why the assertion
 * below is "at least one label", not "a `package: *` label": this config runs three
 * parallel families keyed on directory prefix, and demanding a `package:` entry for a
 * plugin would invent a convention beside the ones the file already has.
 *
 * That is the shape this file exists to stop, and the reason it is a gate rather than a
 * bigger config edit: **nothing reads `.github/labeler.yml` except the action that
 * consumes it.** A missing entry produces no error, no failed run and no diff — only a
 * successful workflow applying a slightly wrong set of labels, which no one has a reason
 * to inspect. A config gap that no gate watches is exactly how this one survived to be
 * found by a human reviewer noticing an odd label set on an unrelated PR.
 *
 * Three directions are pinned, because the config can drift from `packages/` both ways
 * and the workflow can drift out from under both:
 *
 *   1. **Add a package, forget the label.** The #7746 direction.
 *   2. **Delete a package, forget the rule.** The mirror. It was live when this file
 *      landed: the `designer` rule targeted `packages/designer`, whose `package.json`
 *      was deleted in `21396ca4d`, so it had matched nothing since — carried here as a
 *      NAMED exemption while objectui#7771 decided delete-vs-retarget. That card ruled
 *      **delete**: an unmeasured successor relationship (`packages/plugin-designer`)
 *      does not buy a retarget, which would silently change what the `designer` label
 *      means relative to every historical PR carrying it. The rule left the config and
 *      its exemption row left this file, so the direction below is now enforced with no
 *      waiver standing between it and the config. `UNRESOLVABLE_GLOB_EXEMPT` is the one
 *      place that says whether any waiver is outstanding; ⛔ do not restate it here.
 *   3. **Add rules for labels that do not exist yet, then drop the permission that
 *      lets them be created.** See the workflow assertion at the bottom of this file.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT pinned: anything about the repository's live label registry. Labels
 * exist server-side, this test reads the checked-in tree, and a gate that cannot see its
 * subject would be the "declared but never enforced" shape one level up. The registry
 * drifts objectui#7771 records (`plugin: chatbot` registered with no rule, `plugin-view`
 * spelled outside its family's convention) are therefore invisible here, on purpose.
