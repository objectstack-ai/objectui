 * Six component pages name their node slots at the type those keys DECLARE
 * (objectui#7082).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists rather than "the docs gates went green"
 *
 * Every row this pins lives in a `plaintext` fence. `check:doc-snippets`
 * compiles `ts`/`tsx`/`typescript` fences only (`TS_FENCE_LANGUAGES`,
 * `scripts/check-doc-snippet-types.mjs`) and `check:doc-types` reads only the
 * `type` STRING LITERALS out of docs code blocks. So a member row in these
 * fences may name any type at all and every gate stays green -- the blindness
 * objectui#5250 records and objectui#5867 declares the population of. A green
 * CI run on the correction this file accompanies means "nothing else broke",
 * NOT "the correction is right". Same reasoning, and the same shape, as
 * `button-group-doc-surface-6347.test.ts` (PR #7078).
 *
 * ## The authority here is the TS declaration, NOT the Zod mirror
 *
 * That is the one deliberate departure from the #7078 model, and it is load
 * bearing. When this file was written the TS interface and its mirror
 * DISAGREED on four `trigger` rows: `AlertDialogSchema`, `SheetSchema`,
 * `HoverCardSchema` and `DropdownMenuSchema` all declared `trigger: SchemaNode`
 * (singular) while `zod/overlay.zod.ts` mirrored each as
 * `z.union([SchemaNodeSchema, z.array(SchemaNodeSchema)])`. That asymmetry was
 * objectui#7081, then OPEN. Pinning these pages against the mirror would have
 * published the array form on all four and silently pre-empted that ruling, so
 * the pin followed the type an author's editor reads, and its type-level leg
 * was built to go red the day the declaration widened.
 *
 * objectui#7081 has since LANDED (triage 2026-09-03: the validator's accept set
 * does not move; the TypeScript face stops under-reporting it). All seven
 * singular overlay `trigger` members now declare `SchemaNode | SchemaNode[]`,
 * the four rows below were re-derived to the union in the same PR, and the
 * legs that pinned the divergence now pin the agreement. The authority is
 * unchanged -- the page still says what the DECLARATION says; the declaration
 * simply agrees with its mirror now. `overlay-trigger-union-7081.test.ts` pins
 * the widening itself, on every face it ships on.
 *
 * ## What the pages taught before, measured on `2c3cd1b`
 *
 * Nine rows across six pages spelled a node slot `ComponentSchema`. That was a
 * real shipped export (`blocks.ts`) and it was NOT a node slot -- it was the
 * concrete `type: 'component'` block. A reader who looked the name up found a
 * narrow, unrelated type. Seven of the nine are corrected; the other two are
 * NOT type-name defects at all and are recorded as divergences below, because
 * no honest docs-only edit resolves them.
 *
 * ⚠️ Since objectui#4895 that export is GONE -- the whole block schema family
 * was retired under ADR-0049 (maintainer ruling 2026-09-02, option C1). The
 * correction stands unchanged; only its two type-level premise assertions left,
 * because the type they compared against no longer exists. See the note where
 * they stood.
 *
 * ## One row this file records instead of asserting green (two until objectui#7104)
 *
 * `AlertDialogSchema.actions` and `EmptySchema.action` were documented but
 * declared NOWHERE -- not on the TS interface, not in the mirror. Renaming
 * either to `SchemaNode` would have swapped one false claim for another, so
 * both kept their rows and were pinned as UNDECLARED. objectui#7104 then
 * REMOVED the `actions` row from the alert-dialog page: the key was a phantom in
 * every direction (declared nowhere, read by nothing), and the page now
 * publishes the keys the renderer reads (`alert-dialog-read-dialect-7104.test.ts`
 * pins those rows).
 *
 * ⭐ `EmptySchema.action` kept its row and its pin, with this file promising:
 * *the day it is declared, this file goes red and the page is owed a row.* That
 * day is objectui#7105, and this file DID go red -- the tripwire worked. The two
 * pins are not deleted, they are INVERTED in place: the same reads, asserted
 * with the opposite verdict, so what replaced the recorded state is itself
 * pinned. A deleted pin proves nothing about the state it left behind.
 *
 * What #7105 changed, and why the rename is honest now: the key is declared
 * `action?: SchemaNode` on the TS face and mirrored as `SchemaNodeSchema`, and
 * the RENDERER moved to match -- the `(schema as any).action` cast and the
 * `typeof actionSchema === 'object'` guard are both gone, so a bare string node
 * renders instead of being silently dropped. The guard was the whole reason
 * `SchemaNode` would have been a new false claim; it is not a false claim once
 * the renderer admits what the name admits (maintainer, decision batch #69,
 * 2026-09-07). The page was owed its row and now carries it.
 *
 * The requiredness of `AlertDialogSchema.trigger`, `SheetSchema.trigger` and
 * `SheetSchema.content` was the exception left after that: all three were
 * declared OPTIONAL and published REQUIRED, objectui#7073's defect class
 * rather than this card's, so it was fenced out of the diff and pinned
 * instead so a fix on either side would turn this file red rather than
 * passing unnoticed. objectui#7106 closed it: all three pages now spell `?`,
 * joining `ContextMenuSchema.trigger` -- the row #7073 had already corrected
 * -- as agreement rather than divergence.

 * `scripts/js-comment-mask.mjs` actually project (this file,
 * `alert-dialog-read-dialect-7104.test.ts` and `overlay-trigger-union-7081.test.ts`):
 * 20 distinct interface bodies -- 10 declarations and 10 docs fences -- and the
 * member map built WITH the projection equalled the map built with NO
 * projection at all on every one, though the projection really does delete
 * prose in most of them. The guard was correct and INERT: nothing would have
 * noticed it being deleted, weakened, or reverted to a hand-rolled regex
 * (objectui#9768, out of the reverse ablation on objectui#9751). ⛔ The counts
 * in that sentence are a reading of one day and nothing re-derives them; what
 * re-derives the PROPERTY is the pin below, on every run.
 *
 * ⚠️ The `@example` counter-probe further down is NOT that subject, and it
 * reads as though it were: a docblock gutter spells its member-shaped line with
 * three spaces and a star, while `members()` anchors on exactly two spaces
 * followed by an identifier, so that probe passes identically with the
 * projection removed. The row inside the ORDINARY block comment below sits ON
 * the anchor, which is the whole difference -- and is the hazard this reader's
 * docblock names.
 *
 * ⛔ Not a synthetic string handed to `members()`: the pin reads this file off
 * disk and extracts this body the same way it extracts a declaration, so what
 * it measures is a subject's behaviour rather than a shape the tree does not
 * have (the distinction objectui#9748 drew).
