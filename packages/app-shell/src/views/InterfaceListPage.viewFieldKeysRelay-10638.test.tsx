/**
 * objectui#10638 — an interface page relays its source view's `hiddenFields`
 * and `fieldOrder`.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * An ADR-0047 interface page does not hand `ListView` the object's list views;
 * it builds ONE list schema itself, hand-projecting keys off the view its
 * `interfaceConfig.sourceView` resolves to (`filter`, `columns`, `sort`, …).
 * `hiddenFields` and `fieldOrder` — the subtraction and the ordering of the
 * per-view field composition — were not among them. So a source view that
 * authored either showed every column of its `columns`, in `columns` order:
 * declared by the protocol, accepted and served, then dropped at this page.
 * It is the objectui#7516 relay on the second door (`ObjectView` carries both
 * since that card).
 *
 * ## What the relay carries, and what it does not decide
 *
 * objectstack#15184 ruling B wrote the composition into the contract, per
 * view: `columns` projects, `hiddenFields` subtracts, `fieldOrder` sorts what
 * survives (an unlisted survivor sorts last). `ListView`'s `effectiveFields`
 * memo runs those steps on whatever it receives, so this page composes
 * nothing — it only delivers the view's two values beside the view's
 * `columns`.
 *
 * ## The precedence, and why it is whole-composition
 *
 * The page's column list resolves `page → source view → object default`, and
 * the two keys resolve with it, as one unit from one source:
 *
 * - the page's own `columns` win, and then NEITHER view key applies. The page
 *   config declares no spelling of either key (`InterfacePageConfigSchema` is
 *   strict), its `columns` is "defined directly on the page (no view
 *   inheritance)", and `sourceView` is "still honored at runtime as a fallback
 *   when the page has no own `columns`" — the spec's own words. It is also what
 *   keeps the design-mode column drag honest: that drag persists the order it
 *   drew as the page's `columns`, which a relayed view `fieldOrder` would
 *   re-sort straight back.
 * - else the view's `columns`, and its `hiddenFields` / `fieldOrder` with them;
 * - else the object-derived default columns, with neither key: an empty
 *   `columns` "declares no projection, so neither of them applies" (the spec,
 *   on `ListViewSchema.columns`).
 *
 * ## Why the schema is captured rather than rendered
 *
 * The claim is about what THIS page hands down, so `ListView` is stubbed and
 * its `schema` prop recorded — the posture of
 * `ObjectView.fieldOrderRelay-7516.test.tsx`. How the captured keys then shape
 * the columns is `plugin-list`'s half, and is not re-pinned here.
