/**
 * objectui#9256 — the PUBLIC-BLOCK slice: the nineteen ADR-0080 public-block
 * arms whose renderer reads NEITHER content channel, plus `metric-card` in the
 * dashboard widget slot. Family D's earlier pins live in
 * `content-channel-family-d-9256.test.ts`, `content-channel-e3-residual-9256.test.ts`,
 * `content-channel-input-9256.test.ts` and `content-channel-remeasure-9256.test.ts`;
 * this file carries only what this slice adds.
 *
 * ## What is narrowed here
 *
 *   - Eighteen zod-only arms — sixteen in `zod/public-blocks.zod.ts`
 *     (`page:header`, `page:tabs`, `page:accordion`, the nine `record:` blocks
 *     below, and the four `element:` blocks) and two in `zod/objectql.zod.ts`
 *     (`object-metric`, `object-master-detail-form`): a by-name refusal of
 *     `children`, and `body` restated with the same neither-channel guidance,
 *     each kept a MEMBER. No TypeScript declaration in this package restates
 *     any of these nodes, so the zod arm is the only face that moves.
 *   - `record:alert`: `children` only. Its renderer reads a key named `body` as
 *     the message TEXT, so `body` is not a content channel there, and this
 *     slice gives it no tombstone. (A flat `body` there now has its own alias
 *     refusal naming `properties.body`, objectui#10872, pinned in
 *     `record-alert-flat-body-remedy-10872.test.ts`.)
 *   - `page:tabs` / `page:accordion`: the NODE's channels only. Each renders the
 *     `children` of every ITEM in its `items` bag member, and that item-level
 *     key stays live.
 *   - `metric-card`: `children?: never` (and `body` restated) on the TypeScript
 *     face `DashboardWidgetSlotComponentSchema`, and both members on its
 *     private zod twin, the first arm of the widget slot's `z.union`.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ How a `metric-card` refusal surfaces — measured, and the pin follows it
 *
 * The slot arm is not reachable on its own: `widgets` is
 * `z.union([slot arm, strict DashboardWidgetSchema])`. A widget the slot arm
 * refuses falls through to the strict widget schema, which refuses the same
 * key as unrecognized, so the author gets ONE `invalid_union` at the widget's
 * path with each arm's issues under `errors`. The slot arm's message is there,
 * at the arm-relative path `['children']`, and `objectui validate` prints it as
 * one arm of two. So the metric-card rows below assert the refusal INSIDE the
 * union's `errors`, not as a top-level issue — a top-level assertion would pin
 * a shape the union never produces.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Half of the metric-card block is a COMPILE-TIME assertion
 *
 * `?: never` is erased before a test runs. The `@ts-expect-error` lines at the
 * bottom are read by `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` (the `type-check` script),
 * NOT by vitest: under vitest alone, deleting the TypeScript tombstone leaves
 * this file GREEN.
