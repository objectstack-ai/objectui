/**
 * Validates that every workspace package is actually linted by CI.
 *
 * The sibling of scripts/check-type-check-coverage.mjs, for the same reason:
 * `pnpm lint` runs `turbo run lint`, and turbo silently skips any package with
 * no `lint` script — so a package without one is not "clean", it is unlinted.
 * That is how `apps/console`, the largest surface in the repo, went unlinted
 * while carrying 14 ESLint errors that nobody had ever seen (#2923).
 *
 * The stakes are concrete: every `object-ui/*` rule that `eslint.config.js`
 * sets to `error` is a ratchet — added specifically so a new violation fails
 * CI. Those ratchets are worthless in a package that never runs ESLint.
 *
 * That sentence deliberately neither counts those rules nor lists where they
 * came from. It used to do both, and it was wrong on the day it was written: a
 * verbatim copy of the enumeration #3261 removed from
 * `.github/workflows/lint.yml`, short by the same rule, left behind because
 * that fix only touched the workflow (#3279). A hand-copied enumeration drifts
 * by construction, and a stale one still reads as authoritative — so the next
 * person deciding whether their new rule is inside this gate gets a confident,
 * wrong answer. `eslint.config.js` is the only honest list, each rule carrying
 * its own ADR/issue in the comment beside it, and
 * `scripts/__tests__/lint-workflow.test.ts` fails if a count or a rule name
 * reappears here.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-lint-coverage.mjs
 * Exit: 0 = OK, 1 = coverage regressed or the list is stale

// script without turning CI red. Warnings do not matter here — ESLint only
// fails on errors unless `--max-warnings` is set, and it deliberately is not
// (warnings repo-wide run into the thousands, dominated by `no-explicit-any`;
// see #2923). No exact count on purpose: this line and the matching paragraph
// in `.github/workflows/lint.yml` used to quote the same hand-maintained
// figure, which every added `any` aged and nothing ever recomputed — two copies
// free to drift apart, and apart from reality (#3274).
//
// Every entry is real debt: fix the errors, add `"lint": "eslint ."`, then
// delete the entry.
//
// Empty since #2927 closed the last two (`@object-ui/console`, 14 errors, and
// `@object-ui/runner`, 3). Every workspace package now runs ESLint. Adding an
// entry here is a deliberate admission that a package ships known errors — do
// it with an issue number, and treat it as temporary.

// ⛔ The tail this ratchet appends may not put a GitHub closing keyword
// (`close`/`fix`/`resolve`, any tense) immediately in front of the anchor it
// names. This message exists to be QUOTED: the discipline around a DEBT entry
// is to take the INTERMEDIATE reading — the package linted, the entry not yet
// deleted — and paste it into the pull request as proof the work landed. A
// keyword in front of the number makes every such quote a card-closing trigger
// in the merge path, which ends the anchor silently, from a body whose author
// was being careful. GitHub's parser does no sentence parsing, so hedging the
// sentence around it buys nothing. Keep the instruction, lose the keyword, and
// spell the anchor `objectui#` rather than a bare `#` so the reference cannot
// match the closing grammar at all. The landed precedent is the rule-2
// stale-entry message in scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs; the same
// shape still stands in scripts/check-type-check-coverage.mjs and
// scripts/check-action-forward-parity.mjs, which this change deliberately does
// not reach. Pinned by
// scripts/__tests__/check-lint-coverage-closing-keyword.test.ts, which reads
// this module's text rather than trusting this comment.
