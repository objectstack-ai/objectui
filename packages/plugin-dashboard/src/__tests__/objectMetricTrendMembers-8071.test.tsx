/**
 * `object-metric.trend` — the MEMBER SHAPE of the static trend badge
 * (objectui#8071).
 *
 * The member pin for the first of the two PRESENTATION keys objectui#8071's
 * ninth slice takes. Slice 8 pinned the four members that shape the aggregate
 * query behind the NUMBER (`dataSource`, `aggregate`, `filter`, `compareTo`);
 * these two shape what is drawn AROUND the number once it exists, and neither
 * reaches `fetchMetric` / `computeOne`.
 *
 * Asserted through the REGISTERED block (`type: 'object-metric'` mounted by
 * `SchemaRenderer`, registered by this package's own side-effect import) rather
 * than on `ObjectMetricWidget` directly, so the pin covers the path an author
 * actually reaches: the block's `ElementDataSourceGate` shell re-binds only
 * `objectName` and `filter` and forwards every other authored key untouched.
 *
 * ## The member set, and where each member is read
 *
 * The registration declares `trend` as `{ value, label, direction }`. Two
 * different components read it, and that split is the member shape:
 *
 *   - `ObjectMetricWidget` reads the key ONLY to decide whether it survives at
 *     all — `effectiveTrend = derivedTrend ?? trend`.
 *   - `MetricWidget` reads the three members: `value` painted with a hard-coded
 *     `%` suffix, `direction` choosing the glyph and its colour, and `label`
 *     feeding the caption slot.
 *
 * Each member is pinned on an observable only that member can move, and the
 * three `direction` values are pinned as a SET with the omitted-`direction`
 * arm as their control — without it, "renders an up arrow" would also pass on
 * a renderer that painted an up arrow unconditionally.
 *
 * ## The two rows with real semantics to get wrong
 *
 *   - **`description` OUTRANKS `trend.label`.** `MetricWidget` resolves one
 *     caption for the whole badge row: `pickLocalized(description) ||
 *     pickLocalized(trend?.label)`. A tile that authors both silently drops the
 *     trend caption. That is a member semantic, not a layout detail: an author
 *     who adds a `description` to an existing tile loses the trend's own words
 *     with no diagnostic, and nothing else in the repo says so.
 *   - **`compareTo` OVERRIDES a static `trend` outright.** `derivedTrend ??
 *     trend` means a computed comparison does not merge with the authored badge
 *     — it replaces it, value, direction and caption together. The registration
 *     text tells authors to use one or the other ("Use `compareTo` instead when
 *     the trend should be computed from data"); this file is what makes that
 *     sentence true. The override row and its no-`compareTo` control run on the
 *     SAME schema so only the key under test varies: 120-vs-100 derives +20%
 *     up, and the authored badge says 99% down, so neither arm can pass by
 *     painting the other's numbers.
 *
 * ## LIMIT, stated rather than asserted
 *
 * `trend.value` is painted as `{value}%` — the `%` is hard-coded in
 * `MetricWidget`, so the member is a PERCENTAGE whatever the metric's own
 * `format` / `currency` / `suffix` say. That is pinned as the live reading; it
 * is not a claim that a non-percentage trend is expressible.
 *
 * ## Nothing pre-existing covered this key
 *
 * Measured before being decided, and each candidate read end to end rather than
 * dismissed on its greps. The repo's own locator (`memberPinProblem`) requires
 * a pin file to name BOTH the block and the key: exactly two collected files
 * name `object-metric` and `trend`, and neither could carry this pin.
 * `registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts` is the ledger itself.
 * `ObjectMetricWidget.compareTo.test.tsx` is already the `compareTo` pin and
 * never authors a `trend` prop at all — the word appears in its prose and in
 * one title ("shows no trend without compareTo", which asserts the absence of a
 * derived caption). Crediting it would have been slice 7's
 * `action-bodyShape-forward.test.tsx` mistake: the locator satisfied by a file
 * that says nothing about the key.
 *
 * `ObjectMetricWidget.i18nLabel.test.tsx` is the trap slice 8 flagged for this
 * slice, and the re-measurement corrects half of its description: the file
 * authors `trend={{ value, direction, label }}` twice, but it contains ZERO
 * occurrences of the string `object-metric` (control: `ObjectMetricWidget`
 * reads 15 in the same file), so it does NOT satisfy this repo's locator — only
 * a locator keyed on the key name alone. What it asserts is `I18nLabel`
 * resolution: that a map `trend.label` resolves to the active locale, and that
 * the props type accepts the map. It asserts nothing about `value`,
 * `direction`, the member set, or the two precedence rules above, so it is not
 * promoted here; its own subject is left intact.
