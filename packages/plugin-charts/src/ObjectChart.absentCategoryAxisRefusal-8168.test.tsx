/**
 * objectui#8168 — `ObjectChart` REFUSES an object-bound chart that declares no
 * category axis, instead of aggregating on a name nobody wrote.
 *
 * ## What the branch replaces
 *
 * `runAggregate` passed `schema.aggregate` to `ds.aggregate(objectName, {
 * field, function, groupBy, filter })` with no guard on `groupBy`, and the
 * `ds.find` leg handed the same bag to `aggregateRecords`, which buckets on
 * `record[groupBy] ?? 'Unknown'`. With no category declared the first asks a
 * driver to group by `undefined` and the second collapses the object into a
 * single `'Unknown'` bar — and WHICH of those a reader saw was decided by the
 * data source, not by the component. The component's only loud states were a
 * fetch `error` (`chart-error`) and a generic "No data yet"; neither is a
 * statement about an absent binding. `ObjectCalendar`, `ObjectGantt` and
 * `ObjectTimeline` each carry a refusal screen for their own axis; this
 * renderer was the fourth, with none.
 *
 * ## Why the assertions are shaped this way
 *
 * The risk this branch carries is NOT that it fails to fire — it is that it
 * fires on a chart that renders correctly today, because `ObjectChart` is the
 * one choke point every producer reaches. So the pin is two-sided and the
 * second side is the larger one: {@link describe} block 2 is a transcription of
 * the composed schema EVERY producer in this repo hands this component, one
 * `it` per producer leg, each asserting the refusal stays away. An ablation
 * therefore reports which producer a widened predicate would have broken, by
 * name, rather than one undifferentiated red.
 *
 * The distinguishability arm follows objectui#7130's bar (hotcrm#1212): the
 * three states this component can be in must be told apart at a glance, so they
 * are checked on the machine-readable things that carry the difference —
 * `role="alert"` here and on `chart-error`, `role="status"` on
 * `chart-empty-state`, and a distinct `data-testid` on each.

 * `@objectstack/spec`'s `ChartAggregate` BY REFERENCE, where `function` and
 * `groupBy` are REQUIRED and the structured `groupBy` node must name its
 * `field`. Two of the cases below are exactly those documents — a measure with
 * no category, and a date-bucketing node naming no field — so they are no longer
 * writable as typed literals. ⛔ That is not a reason to widen the declaration
 * back: it is the reason this refusal screen exists. Every live producer
 * forwards `aggregate` as `any` (`DashboardRenderer`'s `(widget as any).data`,
 * app-shell's `viewDef: any`), so a document the door refuses still ARRIVES at
 * this component at runtime, and what it owes the reader then is a named
 * refusal rather than a bar labelled `Unknown`.
 *
 * So the out-of-contract shape is asserted HERE, once, named, and greppable —
 * rather than by relaxing the parameter type, which would quietly make every
 * other literal in this file unchecked too.

 * binding had to be enumerated and checked against it. These are those
 * producers, transcribed from their composing source on `7444916ce`, one `it`
 * per leg. Each cites the line it came from so the transcription can be
 * re-checked rather than trusted.
 *
 * The shared fact that makes them all safe: every one of the five floors its
 * own category — the three relays through the `|| 'name'` literals objectui#7547
 * will retire, the two dashboard surfaces through `options.xField || 'name'`,
 * which is NOT part of #7547's six and stays. So none of them can reach this
 * refusal today, and after #7547 retires the relay floors the three that lose
 * theirs reach it exactly when the author declared nothing — which is the point.
