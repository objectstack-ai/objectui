/**
 * objectui#8830 — the calendar plugin page's "CalendarConfig" section states a
 * KEY SET and a COUNT. Both are now derived from the two sources they describe,
 * on every run, instead of being maintained by hand.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The section carried one sentence that fused two different faces into a single
 * false claim: that `CalendarConfig` is the spec's strict four-key schema, that
 * "a fifth key is rejected rather than ignored", and that `ObjectCalendar`
 * "destructures exactly" those same four — "so the list above is also the whole
 * of what the renderer reads".
 *
 * Measured on the dispatch base, `@objectstack/spec` 17.4.0 installed:
 *
 *   SPEC FACE      `CalendarConfigSchema` is a strict object of exactly
 *                  `startDateField` / `endDateField` / `titleField` /
 *                  `colorField`, and refuses `allDayField` BY NAME with an
 *                  `unrecognized_keys` diagnostic. True, and the only half the
 *                  old sentence got right.
 *   RENDERER FACE  `ObjectCalendar` reads FIVE keys off the `calendar` block —
 *                  those four plus objectui's own `allDayField`, load-bearing
 *                  since objectui#8026.
 *   AUTHORING FACE `a fifth key is rejected` is false on both objectui paths.
 *                  Neither published face of `ObjectCalendarSchema` declares the
 *                  `calendar` container at all, so the block rides
 *                  `BaseSchema`'s passthrough unexamined; on the list-view path
 *                  the container IS declared, as this package's own mirror of
 *                  the spec schema, which keeps `.passthrough()` for exactly
 *                  this. Both admit `allDayField`.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Why this file is a DERIVATION and not a corrected number
 *
 * The enumeration had already drifted once — `allDayField` became load-bearing
 * in objectui#8026 and the page was never revisited — and the card that caught
 * it measured only the one key it happened to notice. Adding that key to the
 * list would reproduce the same hand-maintained enumeration with a fresher
 * value in it. So nothing here is restated: the renderer's key set is parsed out
 * of `ObjectCalendar.tsx` and the spec's out of `CalendarConfigSchema.shape`,
 * and the page is compared against both. A red here always means "the page
 * drifted from the renderer (or the spec)", never "update the test".
 *
 * ⚠️ The derivation FAILS LOUDLY rather than vacuously. A renamed resolver, a
 * renamed local, or a moved section throws — an empty key set can never pass as
 * agreement, which is the failure mode a hand-written list has by construction.
