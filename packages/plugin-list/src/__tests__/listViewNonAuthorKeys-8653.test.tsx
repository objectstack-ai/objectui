 *
 * `list-view` — the two undeclared keys `ListView` reads, ruled per key
 * (objectui#8653, the objectui#8327 family's `plugin-list` card).
 *
 * Sibling of `plugin-grid/src/__tests__/gridNonAuthorKeys.test.tsx`, which is
 * where objectui#5091's four grid keys were said out loud to the tooling. This
 * file does the same job one package over, for two keys that took OPPOSITE
 * exits — and the reason they differ is a measurement, re-derived below rather
 * than asserted in prose.
 *
 * ## The governing ruling (objectui#8327 family triage)
 *
 * `packages/types` is a MIRROR, not an authority: its `ListViewSchema` is
 * `z.input` of a zod object that imports `@objectstack/spec/ui`'s own slots by
 * reference. So declaring a key here that the platform contract does not
 * declare makes this repo ACCEPT WHAT THE PLATFORM REFUSES. Each key therefore
 * has three exits — declare · retire the read · route to the producer — and
 * which one is available is decided by the contract, per key, not by taste.
 *
 * ## `title` — RETIRED (item 1)
 *
 * The card reported `title` as "read undeclared off `ListViewSchema`,
 * compiling only through the string index signature". Re-measured with the
 * TypeScript checker against the emitted declarations (⛔ never a grep,
 * objectui#8410): `title` is indeed NOT a declared member — but the read was
 * `(schema as any).title`, an `as any` CAST, so the index signature was never
 * what carried it. That matters, because the cast was also laundering a second
 * defect: `viewLabel` is `string`, `ListViewSchema.label` is the spec's INLINE
 * locale map `string | I18nLabel`, and `X || any` collapses the whole
 * expression to `any`. A locale-map label therefore reached
 * `sanitizeFileNameBase` as an OBJECT and exported as `[object Object]`.
 *
 * The exit is retire-the-read, and the two measurements that chose it:
 *
 *   - the platform contract REFUSES `title` on the list surface BY NAME
 *     (`unrecognized_keys: ['title']`) while ACCEPTING it on the grid surface.
 *     That asymmetry is the whole reason objectui#6639 could take the DECLARE
 *     branch for `ObjectGridSchema.title` and this card cannot: declaring it
 *     here would publish a key the save gate rejects. Pinned in section 1.
 *   - a parse-based, order-agnostic census of `apps/ examples/ content/` and
 *     `packages/` found ZERO `list-view` nodes authoring `title`, against 2
 *     `object-grid` nodes that do (the same two `content/docs/api/
 *     schema-reference.md` hits objectui#6639's census reported). #6639 chose
 *     DECLARE because authors existed; here they do not, so nothing loses a
 *     caption. ⚠️ That census is a one-shot reading taken on this branch and
 *     nothing re-derives it (AGENTS.md #9) — it is recorded as the reason the
 *     branch was chosen, never as a live fact. What IS re-derived every run is
 *     everything asserted below.
 *
 * ## `rowActionDefs` — EXEMPT AND STILL READ, now pinned (item 2)
 *
 * objectui#5091 ruled this same producer-derived key NON-AUTHOR SURFACE for
 * `object-grid` on 2026-08-19 (a knowing reversal of the 2026-08-18 line). The
 * card's question was whether that exemption extends to `ListView`'s read
 * sites, which carried no docblock and no pin. It does, and on the same three
 * legs plus two this site adds:
 *
 *   - the producer is the same one: `app-shell`'s `ObjectView` derives it from
 *     `objectDef.actions` filtered by `locations.includes('list_item')` and
 *     writes it onto a `fullSchema: ListViewSchema`; `plugin-view`'s
 *     `ObjectView` composes the same key onto a `list-view` node.
 *   - the platform contract REFUSES `rowActionDefs` by name on BOTH the list
 *     and the grid surface, so "declare" is off the table on either.
 *   - `@object-ui/types` declares it on NEITHER mirror, which is why both
 *     renderers read it through a cast.
 *   - ⭐ this reader RELAYS it onward to the child `object-grid` node, where
 *     the data-table surface DOES declare it. Deleting the read here silently
 *     removes the row-action menu the host composed.
 *   - ⭐ this reader also feeds it to `listViewPredicates`, so a field named
 *     only by a row action's `visible` CEL reaches `$select`. Deleting the read
 *     here silently drops that operand from the projection — objectui#3501's
 *     fail-closed CEL fault (`No such key`), reached with a success receipt.
 *
 * ## Why the pin is written this way
 *
 * The existing protection for this key is `app-shell`'s
 * `ObjectView.relayRungCensus-7559.test.ts`, whose `WRITE_EXCEPTIONS` entry
 * names the read in a REASON STRING. That census re-derives what the PRODUCER
 * writes; nothing in it re-derives that the READER still reads. Deleting either
 * `ListView` read site leaves it green — which is exactly the decay the card
 * was filed about, and exactly what sections 3 and 4 below remove.
 *
 * Every assertion here is a RUNTIME or CONTRACT reading. ⛔ No assertion is a
 * source grep: `SchemaRenderer` hands a node's leftover keys to the component
 * as props, so a `schema.KEY` grep returns a confident zero on keys that are
 * really consumed (AGENTS.md, "a source grep cannot answer this"). Each
 * negative carries a same-instrument control that fires, so a zero is a
 * reading rather than a broken probe.
