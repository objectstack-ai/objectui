/**
 * An authored `operators` on an `object-grid` changes nothing drawn (objectui#9729).
 *
 * ## Why this reading exists
 *
 * `objectql.zod.ts#ObjectGridSchema` states `operators` and the `ObjectGridSchema`
 * twin does not — the second LOCAL entry in the `MirroredUndeclared` ledger, and
 * the one whose mirror line carries its own provenance: a comment saying the key
 * was missing from an earlier TypeScript scan. The contract review needs to know
 * whether a renderer consumes it.
 *
 * ⛔ A source grep cannot answer that, because this renderer receives a node's
 * leftover keys as props: `ObjectGridRenderer` spreads everything it does not
 * itself consume onto `ObjectGrid`. So the question is asked with a RULER — the
 * same document drawn twice, compared as bytes — rather than by reading code.
 *
 * ## The ruler, and why the control comes first
 *
 * A byte comparison that reports "no difference" is worthless unless the
 * instrument can report one. The first case pins that two identical documents
 * draw identical bytes (the ruler is stable — no timestamps, no random ids), the
 * second is a LIT CONTROL on a key the renderer demonstrably DOES read, and only
 * then is the measurement taken. It is taken twice: once on a plain grid and
 * once with the filter surface on, since `operators` is a filtering word and a
 * grid without a filter affordance would be the wrong corpus to ask.
 *
 * ⚠️ The claim is bounded by the ruler: this is what the RENDERED output does
 * with the key, on these documents. ⛔ It is not a claim that no code anywhere
 * could ever read it.
 *
 * ⛔ This file takes no position on the remedy — objectui#9729 is the card.
