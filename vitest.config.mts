// ── The suite runs in UTC, always (objectui#8366) ───────────────────────────
//
// A family of pins asserts LITERAL local-date faces — `Jul 4, 2024`,
// `Jul 4, '24`, `7/4/2024 7:00 am` — built from fixed UTC instants
// (`2024-07-04T07:00:00.000Z` and friends) through LOCAL date parts. Nothing
// pinned the runner's zone, so the face those pins render was a property of
// the contributor's laptop. Measured on `76573a184` over the six files that
// carry the family:
//
//   TZ=UTC              6 files passed              (184 tests, 0 failed)
//   TZ=Europe/Paris     3 failed | 3 passed         (7 failed)
//   TZ=Asia/Shanghai    3 failed | 3 passed         (7 failed)
//   TZ=America/New_York 4 failed | 2 passed        (31 failed)
//   TZ=Etc/GMT+8        4 failed | 2 passed        (33 failed)
//
// So the suite was green at EXACTLY ONE offset, not merely west of some
// boundary: a `07:00 AM` face pinned off an `07:00Z` instant is true at
// UTC+00:00 and nowhere else. CI is UTC, so the class was invisible there and
// only ever cost a contributor — a wall of red that is not about the code.
//
// Why the zone and not the assertions: those literals are load-bearing ON
// PURPOSE. `date-display.optionsStyle-7745.test.ts` says so in its own words —
// its faces are "anchored by the two literals the card measured, so a redesign
// that moved both sides together could not pass silently." Deriving the
// expected face from the same formatter under test is what the two files that
// ALREADY pass do (`dataset-format.date.test.ts`,
// `DatasetWidget.dateMeasure.test.tsx`), and it is the right assertion where
// the claim is "this surface shows what a list cell shows" — but on an anchor
// it degrades to `formatDate(v) === formatDate(v)` and asserts nothing. Pinning
// the offset the anchors were written against keeps them.
//
// This deletes no coverage: no test in this repo reads the ambient zone
// (`process.env.TZ`, `getTimezoneOffset`, `resolvedOptions().timeZone` — zero
// hits across every `*.test.ts`/`*.test.tsx`), and the one zone-aware surface
// that exists takes its zone from METADATA, explicitly
// (`GanttView.tsx`'s `tzOffsetMs(schema.timeZone, …)`). Non-UTC coverage, if
// it is ever wanted, wants an explicit per-case zone — never the runner's
// ambient one, which is the thing that made this silent.
//
// Unconditional on purpose: a contributor's zone usually comes from
// `/etc/localtime` and not from `TZ`, so an `??=` would leave exactly the
// reported population unfixed while pretending to fix it.
//
// Pinned by `scripts/__tests__/vitest-timezone-pin-8366.test.ts`, which spawns
// a real vitest under a non-UTC `TZ` and asserts the run still sees UTC — so
// deleting this line reds CI, where the ambient zone would otherwise hide it.

// Refuse the two invocations that pass while running none of the tests the

// This call covers every run whose config resolution ends up here: `pnpm test`,
// and any package-cwd run in a package that either has no `vitest.config.*` of
// its own (the lookup walks up to this file) or has one that imports this file.
// It is NOT the single choke point — that claim used to be written both here
// and in the guard's docstring, and was wrong for the 11 packages carrying a
// STANDALONE `vitest.config.ts` (objectui#5406): nothing imported this module
// from there, so the guard never ran. Those 11 now call the guard themselves,
