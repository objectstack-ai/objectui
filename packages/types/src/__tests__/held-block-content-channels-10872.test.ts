 * objectui#10872 batch 5 — the content channels of the six public blocks
 * batch 4 armed by reference (`action:button`, `action:icon`, `action:group`,
 * `action:menu`, `element:definition-list`, `element:repeater`), narrowed by
 * the objectui#9256 method. The arms themselves are pinned in
 * `held-public-block-arms-10872.test.ts`; the nineteen blocks objectui#9256
 * narrowed first are pinned in `content-channel-public-blocks-9256.test.ts`.
 * This file carries only what this batch adds.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * Batch 4 gave the six an arm, and each arm took `BaseSchema`'s channels as
 * they were. So `{ "type": "action:group", "children": [ … ] }` parsed green on
 * both faces, while no renderer of the six reads the node's `children` (nor
 * its `body`) and `SchemaRenderer` strips both out of the props it spreads:
 * the child list rendered nothing, with no error and no warning. And a flat
 * `body` was refused with `BaseSchema`'s objectui#6771 remedy, which points at
 * `children` — the key that did nothing.
 *
 * ## What is narrowed
 *
 * Each arm declares `children` as a by-name refusal and restates `body` with
 * the same guidance: two `retirementTombstone` members fed ONE
 * `neitherContentChannelGuidance` string, both kept MEMBERS, exactly as the
 * objectui#9256 arms are. The message names what the block renders instead,
 * and so the channel an author's content belongs in: `properties.actions` for
 * the group and the menu, `properties.items` for the definition list, the
 * `label` and `icon` for the two buttons. `element:repeater` has no content
 * channel, and its message says so rather than naming one.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a second dialect
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s own `PageComponentSchema` has no node-level `children`
 * and refuses one as an unrecognized key, on every one of the six. The last
 * block below re-reads that verdict from the INSTALLED spec, so a spec that
 * starts accepting the key turns this file red here, and the refusal has to
 * be re-decided rather than drift.
 *
 * The two readings that say no renderer reads either channel (a TypeScript
 * type-checker census of the `@object-ui/components` program on a built tree,
 * and a runtime probe through the real `SchemaRenderer` and registry) were
 * taken once and are recorded on objectui#10872. Nothing in this file
 * re-derives them: it pins the validator's answer, not the renderers'.
