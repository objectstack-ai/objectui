/**
 * objectui#8213 — the object page wrote a THIRD spelling of the kanban lane
 * key into the view-level config it hands to `list-view`.
 *
 * `kanbanViewOptions` emitted `{ groupBy: lane, groupByField: lane }`: the
 * spec's own `groupByField`, and beside it `groupBy`, which
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s strict `KanbanConfigSchema` refuses BY NAME. Upstream
 * already knows the OTHER legacy spelling by name — probing `groupField`
 * answers "Did you mean `groupField` → `groupByField`?" — and knows nothing at
 * all about `groupBy`. objectui#8193 had moved this producer onto the canonical
 * key and deliberately left this half for a card of its own, because dropping
 * it needed a census first.
 *
 * ⭐ WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A SOURCE-TEXT SNAPSHOT. Every arm
 * below RUNS the producer and asks `KanbanConfigSchema` about the object it
 * actually returned. Nothing here greps `ObjectView.tsx`, so a reformat, a
 * rename of the local `lane` variable, or a move of the expression cannot make
 * these arms lie in either direction: the claim is about emitted KEYS, and the
 * only way to satisfy it is to emit them.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CLAIM IS NARROWER THAN "THE EMITTED BAG VALIDATES", and saying so is
 * the point of the ratchet arm. The producer also emits `titleField` and
 * `cardFields`, and `KanbanConfigSchema` — which declares exactly
 * `groupByField` / `summarizeField` / `columns` — refuses BOTH of those by name
 * as well. They are a different question and stay:
 *   - `cardFields` is a DECLARED deprecated alias of the spec's `columns` in
 *     this repo's own `KanbanConfig` mirror (`@object-ui/types`), i.e. drift
 *     this repo has taken a documented position on;
 *   - `titleField` is live and undeclared anywhere — `ListView` destructures it
 *     out of the merged config and forwards it onto the generated
 *     `object-kanban` node.
 * Neither is a second spelling of a key this expression already writes
 * correctly, which is all objectui#8213 was. So the honest assertion is not
 * "nothing is refused" but "the refused set is EXACTLY the two known ones" —
 * which reddens for a fourth undeclared key, and would have reddened for
 * `groupBy`.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO ARM HERE ASSERTS THE `...restKanban` OVERRIDE, deliberately. `ListView`
 * spread the rest of the merged kanban config AFTER its own `groupBy:
 * laneField`, so a surviving `groupBy` won over the lane it had just resolved.
 * That override was real, but it could not be pinned FROM THIS PRODUCER: every
 * bag this producer can build has `groupBy` and `groupByField` holding the same
 * value by construction, so an override row driven by it passes with or without
 * the fix — a test that cannot fail. Distinguishing the two spellings needed a
 * hand-built `plugin-list` fixture (`options.kanban.groupBy: 'a'` against
 * `kanban.groupByField: 'b'`), which was a `plugin-list` change on its own card.
 * ⭐ THAT FIXTURE NOW EXISTS and the override is closed — objectui#8365,
 * `plugin-list/src/__tests__/ListView.strayGroupByRefused-8365.test.tsx`. What
 * THIS deletion did remains what it always was: it removed the only producer in
 * this repo that fed the override. The arms below are unchanged by that card,
 * because they measure the producer, not the render branch.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted before running, then observed:
 * restore `{ groupBy: lane, groupByField: lane }` in `kanbanViewOptions` and
 * the two discriminating arms plus the ratchet arm go RED by name, while every
 * CONTROL (the schema refusing a bogus key, the schema accepting the canonical
 * config, the lane still resolving) stays GREEN in both worlds. That asymmetry
 * is what makes the controls worth their lines: an instrument that refused
 * everything would satisfy the discriminating arms for the wrong reason.
