/**
 * objectui#8213 — the object page wrote a THIRD spelling of the kanban lane
 * key into the view-level config it hands to `list-view`.
 *
 * `kanbanViewOptions` emitted `{ groupBy: lane, groupByField: lane }`: the
 * spec's own `groupByField`, and beside it `groupBy`, which
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s strict `KanbanConfigSchema` refuses BY NAME. Upstream
 * already knows the OTHER legacy spelling by name — probing `groupField`
 * answers "Did you mean `groupField` → `groupByField`?" — and knows nothing at
 * all about `groupBy`. objectui#8193 had moved this producer onto the canonical
 * key and deliberately left this half for a card of its own, because dropping
 * it needed a census first.
 *
 * ⭐ WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A SOURCE-TEXT SNAPSHOT. Every arm
 * below RUNS the producer and asks `KanbanConfigSchema` about the object it
 * actually returned. Nothing here greps `ObjectView.tsx`, so a reformat, a
 * rename of the local `lane` variable, or a move of the expression cannot make
 * these arms lie in either direction: the claim is about emitted KEYS, and the
 * only way to satisfy it is to emit them.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CLAIM IS NARROWER THAN "THE EMITTED BAG VALIDATES", and saying so is
 * the point of the ratchet arm. The producer also emits `titleField` and
 * `cardFields`, and `KanbanConfigSchema` — which declared exactly
 * `groupByField` / `summarizeField` / `columns` through `@objectstack/spec`
 * 17.4.0 — refused BOTH of those by name as well. 17.5.0 declares `titleField`
 * (objectui#11073), so the ratchet went DOWN to `cardFields` alone. They were a
 * different question and stayed:
 *   - `cardFields` is a DECLARED deprecated alias of the spec's `columns` in
 *     this repo's own `KanbanConfig` mirror (`@object-ui/types`), i.e. drift
 *     this repo has taken a documented position on;
 *   - `titleField` is live — `ListView` destructures it out of the merged
 *     config and forwards it onto the generated `object-kanban` node — and was
 *     undeclared anywhere until 17.5.0 declared it on `KanbanConfigSchema`.
 * Neither is a second spelling of a key this expression already writes
 * correctly, which is all objectui#8213 was. So the honest assertion is not
 * "nothing is refused" but "the refused set is EXACTLY the known ones" (two
 * through 17.4.0, one since) — which reddens for a new undeclared key, and
 * would have reddened for `groupBy`.
 *
 * ⭐ THE RATCHET REACHED ZERO (objectui#6152 round 12, seat answer Q1 → A). The
 * producer writes the card fields as the spec's `columns` now, because
 * `@object-ui/types` judges this bag as the spec's list overlay does and refuses
 * `options.kanban.cardFields` by name, and `ListView` reads `columns` for the
 * cards (the node and the `$select` measured identical under either spelling).
 * So the refused set is EMPTY, and the arms below say so; any undeclared key
 * the producer emits from here on reddens them.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO ARM HERE ASSERTS THE `...restKanban` OVERRIDE, deliberately. `ListView`
 * spread the rest of the merged kanban config AFTER its own `groupBy:
 * laneField`, so a surviving `groupBy` won over the lane it had just resolved.
 * That override was real, but it could not be pinned FROM THIS PRODUCER: every
 * bag this producer can build has `groupBy` and `groupByField` holding the same
 * value by construction, so an override row driven by it passes with or without
 * the fix — a test that cannot fail. Distinguishing the two spellings needed a
 * hand-built `plugin-list` fixture (`options.kanban.groupBy: 'a'` against
 * `kanban.groupByField: 'b'`), which was a `plugin-list` change on its own card.
 * ⭐ THAT FIXTURE NOW EXISTS and the override is closed — objectui#8365,
 * `plugin-list/src/__tests__/ListView.strayGroupByRefused-8365.test.tsx`. What
 * THIS deletion did remains what it always was: it removed the only producer in
 * this repo that fed the override. The arms below are unchanged by that card,
 * because they measure the producer, not the render branch.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted before running, then observed:
 * restore `{ groupBy: lane, groupByField: lane }` in `kanbanViewOptions` and
 * the two discriminating arms plus the ratchet arm go RED by name, while every
 * CONTROL (the schema refusing a bogus key, the schema accepting the canonical
 * config, the lane still resolving) stays GREEN in both worlds. That asymmetry
 * is what makes the controls worth their lines: an instrument that refused
 * everything would satisfy the discriminating arms for the wrong reason.
