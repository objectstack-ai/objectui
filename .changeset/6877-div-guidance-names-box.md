'@object-ui/components': patch

Rewrite the `div` deprecation guidance so it names `box`, the one replacement measured drop-in.

The notice and the machine-readable `deprecated.replacement` recommended `card` / `flex` /
`container` / `stack` / `grid` for the plain-wrapper case. Measured through the real renderer,
each of those injects classes of its own, `card` also moves the children into an extra element,
and four of the five read `children` only — so a node authoring `body` loses its content
silently, at an unchanged element count. `box` (objectui#3965) is the class-transparent swap and
was never mentioned. Deprecation guidance is followed literally, so the old text manufactured
exactly the conversions objectui#3965 measured and rejected.

Both statements now name `box` first for the mechanical swap, keep the layout components for the
cases where their layout is actually wanted, and state the `body` → `children` move that every
option except `card` requires. `span`'s guidance is deliberately unchanged.

⚠️ **Dated note, 2026-09-28 — every option, and `div` itself, reads `children` only —
objectui#6771.** Later in this same release objectui#6771 retired `body` as a child-list
spelling, and `card` and `div` dropped their `body` arms with it. So the `body` → `children`
move is one every option requires, `card` included. A retype no longer drops `body` content
either: `div` does not draw it, and validation refuses the key by name. The notice's `body`
bullet now says that (objectui#8284); `deprecated.replacement` is unchanged. The rest of this
entry is kept as the reading of this change.
