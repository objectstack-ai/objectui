/**
 * objectui#8754 — the ONE-HOP INDIRECT TEMPLATE LEG, and the PIN for the keys
 * it makes reachable.
 *
 * ## Why this block exists, and what it is answerable to
 *
 * The shape: a component builds the key into a local and passes the bare
 * identifier to `t()`. Before the leg, every leaf under such a head landed in
 * CONFIRMED — the top tier — while a shipping screen rendered it. Measured on
 * `main` when the card was ruled: eight of them, deleted from all ten packs,
 * `1090/1090` i18n tests green, the owning view's own suite green, and this
 * script reporting the shorter tier without complaint. ⇒ ⛔ a green CI was
 * worth NOTHING on this class, and that — not the eight keys — is what the pin
 * below is for.
 *
 * ## ⛔ How the pin avoids the self-pollution trap
 *
 * `textFootprint()` greps the whole repo, `scripts/` included. A test that
 * SPELLS a pack key becomes a bounded textual occurrence of it and pushes that
 * key from CONFIRMED to NEEDS-REVIEW — the trap this script's own header
 * records from an earlier draft, and the one objectui#8754 names in its "What
 * NOT to do". So ⛔ NOT ONE PACK KEY IS SPELLED HERE. Everything is DERIVED
 * from the tree on the run that reads it:
 *
 *   - the HEADS come out of `collectIndirectTemplateHeads()`, read off the
 *     view's own source;
 *   - the MEMBERS come out of `readVocabulary()` over the view's own closed
 *     discriminator union — the same reader `DYNAMIC_KEY_FAMILIES` uses;
 *   - the KEYS are never written down at all: what is asserted is the cross
