/**
 * `showFilters` is retired on `object-grid` (objectui#11068, triage's answer to
 * the card's retriage) — the DECLARATION half. The renderer half, which shows an
 * authored `showFilters` draws nothing, is `plugin-grid`'s
 * `ObjectGrid.declaredKeys-11068.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## Why a tombstone, and why it points at the list view
 *
 * `ObjectGrid` has no filter UI. The one filter surface objectui draws is the
 * `list-view` toolbar's filter builder, switched by `userActions.filter`, so
 * honouring the key on the grid would have meant building a second filter
 * surface. The upstream protocol's `object-grid` row does not declare the key
 * either. Deleting the member would refuse nothing on the zod face, whose twin
 * ends `.passthrough()`; the interface inherited `BaseSchema`'s index signature
 * until objectui#8347 (and a widened value still skips the excess-property
 * check).
 * So the key stays DECLARED and unwritable on both faces — `retirementTombstone()`
 * and `?: never` — as `rowSpecActions` and `defaultSort` are.
 *
 * ## The two authoring faces, and the controls beside each refusal
 *
 * The node face (`safeValidateSchema`) and the strict authoring face
 * (`StrictAnyComponentSchema`) are both asked. A red parse proves a by-name
 * refusal only beside a document that stays green on the same instrument: the
 * grid without the key, a list view's own `showFilters` and `userActions.filter`,
 * and an object view's own `showFilters` — which `ObjectView` still reads, so it
 * is not retired here.
