/**
 * Which authored `on*` keys reach the registered `'detail'` renderer — measured
 * per key, driven through the real `SchemaRenderer` — and the guard that a bare
 * deletion of either declaration goes red (objectui#7804, the `plugin-detail`
 * slice of the 39-row `KNOWN_UNDECLARED_READS` ledger).
 *
 * ## The exposure
 *
 * `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`. A key an arm does not declare is NOT
 * refused — it stops being judged and the value is KEPT, then reaches the
 * renderer that reads it. `ComponentRegistry.register('detail', DetailView)`
 * registers `DetailView` RAW (no wrapper, `../index.tsx`), so nothing is
 * interposed: the authored value arrives at `schema.onNavigate` /
 * `schema.onAddComment` BY IDENTITY and is CALLED. An authored
 * `onNavigate: { action: 'toast' }` therefore parses GREEN and is handed to a
 * call site expecting a function — objectui#7664's measured mechanism, and the
 * shape `AlertDialogSchema.onAction` had until objectui#7104 declared it.
 *
 * ## Per-key disposition, MEASURED not assumed (the batch #69 ruling)
 *
 * Both keys measure `'runtime-slot'`, and they do NOT share one channel:
 *
 *   - `onNavigate` — read in `DetailView`'s OWN body (`handleBack`,
 *     `handleEdit`, the post-delete redirect) and CALLED there. Suite 1 drives
 *     the back button and the authored function runs with the arguments the
 *     call site builds.
 *   - `onAddComment` — never called by `DetailView`; it is FORWARDED as a React
 *     prop into `<RecordComments>`, whose `handleSubmit` awaits it. Suite 1
 *     drives the composer, so the leg measures the forward AND the call at the
 *     other end. It is also gated by `schema.comments`, itself an undeclared
 *     key kept alive by the same passthrough.
 *
 * ⇒ two keys, two channels, one disposition — which is a reading, not an
 * assumption: the sibling slice on `object-kanban` got three DIFFERENT
 * dispositions out of three keys sharing one prefix.
 *
 * ## Every control can fire
 *
 * `onNeverReadByAnyKnownReader` is authored on the SAME document, in the SAME
 * render, and must stay at zero calls. Without it a harness that fired every
 * authored function would read exactly like a live channel.
 *
 * ## Predictions, written before the code (red-first, base `a686403b3`)
 *
 *   - suite 1 (reachability) PASSES on the base tree — the channels are what
 *     this change declares, not what it builds;
 *   - suite 2 (the hazard) PASSES on the base tree for the same reason;
 *   - suite 3 (the zod face) FAILS on both keys: `DetailSchema.shape.onNavigate`
 *     and `.onAddComment` are `undefined`, and an authored action object parses
 *     GREEN and survives into the parsed output. `onBack` — already a #6124
 *     runtime-slot refusal on this very arm — is the lit control and is GREEN
 *     before and after;
 *   - suite 4 (the derivation) FAILS on both keys for the same reason.
