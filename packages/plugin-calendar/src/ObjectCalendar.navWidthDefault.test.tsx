/**
 * Pins the drawer width a calendar gets when it declares no `navigation`
 * (objectui#6303 — the sibling of `ObjectGantt.navWidthDefault.test.tsx`).
 *
 * `ObjectCalendar` used to spell `min(960px, 60vw)` in TWO places: the
 * `navConfig` default (`{ mode: 'drawer', width: 'min(960px, 60vw)' }`) and,
 * further down, a render-site
 * `width={(navigation.width as any) ?? 'min(960px, 60vw)'}`. The second is why
 * taking only the first would have changed nothing — the old width survived by
 * a different route.
 *
 * `width` is `@deprecated [#2578 -> size]` and `resolveOverlayWidth` gives an
 * explicit `width` priority OVER `size`, so spelling it kept the deprecated
 * branch load-bearing on the path most calendars take. The default is now
 * `{ mode: 'drawer' }` with no render-site fallback: `resolveOverlayWidth`
 * returns `undefined` and RecordDetailDrawer's own `width` default supplies the
 * identical CSS — a zero-pixel change.
 *
 * Both halves below are load-bearing and fail for different reasons:
 *
 *   half 1 — the calendar must stop injecting a width of its own (it has to
 *            hand `undefined` down, or the drawer's default can never apply).
 *            This half is what catches a re-added `??` fallback at the render
 *            site, which half 2 alone cannot see: the fallback's value is the
 *            same string the drawer default produces;
 *   half 2 — the width the REAL drawer then resolves must still be that value.
 *            Without this half the calendar would follow a moved drawer default
 *            invisibly, which is the regression the indirection introduces.
 *
 * A third case pins the other direction: an AUTHORED `navigation.width` still
 * wins. What #6303 removed is the renderer spelling the deprecated key as its
 * own default — not the key's acceptance as an authored value.
 *
 * All three assert the resolved width VALUE — never a `className`, never "it
 * renders", either of which passes in both worlds.

 * objectui#7307 — this file's `/api/v1/security/explain` escape, served here.
 *
 * Nothing below asks for a security verdict, yet every run opened a REAL TCP
 * connection to `http://localhost:3000`. Traced with a stack probe on the
 * network-escape guard's attribution point:
 *
 *   RecordDetailDrawer (the drawer this file opens)
 *     -> useRecordEditable   packages/plugin-detail/src/useRecordEditable.ts:75
 *       -> `const doFetch = apiFetch ?? fetch`      <- the escape
 *         POST /api/v1/security/explain
 *
 * The hook reads the host's AUTHENTICATED `apiFetch` off
 * `SchemaRendererContext` and, with no host supplying one, degrades to the
 * GLOBAL `fetch` by design — a standalone embed must keep rendering rather than
 * crash. Under happy-dom that global is a real HTTP client and the document URL
 * defaults to `http://localhost:3000`, so the relative path resolved to a live
 * request. The read is best-effort (a network or parse failure leaves the record editable — fail open), which is why the three cases below stayed green while the request always failed.
 *
 * Answered from a RECORDING double — the shape objectui#5225 settled on and
 * `packages/plugin-report/src/__tests__/DatasetReportRenderer.test.tsx`
 * carries. Deliberately NOT a blanket network stub: it records every URL it is
 * handed and `afterEach` fails on any URL that is not the explain route, so an
 * escape to somewhere else reds here instead of vanishing into that `catch`.
 *
 * What it answers, and why that changes no assertion here: the permissive
 * verdict, in the two response shapes the two hooks read (ADR-0090 D6 /
 * ADR-0095 C2) — `{ record: { visible } }` for a single `recordId`,
 * `{ records: [{ recordId, visible }] }` for a batched `recordIds`.
 * `useRecordEditable` initialises `allowed` to `true` and its failure path
 * leaves it there, and the ONLY consumer of the batched lookup is
 * `resolveRowRecordCrudAffordance`, whose rule is `recordVerdict !== false` —
 * so `true` and the absent verdict the failing request produced are the same
 * value at every read site. The drawer's width — everything this file asserts — is not derived from the verdict at all.
