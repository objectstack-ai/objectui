 * `record:details` — the published authoring surface stays in parity with
 * `@objectstack/spec` `RecordDetailsProps` (objectui#3807, objectstack#5611).
 *
 * Sibling of `recordHighlightsInputs.spec-parity.test.ts` (objectui#3407 /
 * PR #3795) and the same two directions, on the block where the drift was
 * worse: there the `fields` description spelled an entry shape that was merely
 * INCOMPLETE (`readonly` missing); here the `sections` description spelled an
 * entry shape the spec had DELETED. Until 17.x `sections` was
 * `z.array(z.string())` — "section IDs" — and objectstack#5611 replaced that
 * with the object form outright (no producer, no consumer, so one shape rather
 * than two de-facto contracts). The registry text kept teaching the ID list.
 *
 * WHY A DESCRIPTION IS WORTH A TEST. `inputs` is not documentation, it is the
 * published contract: `gen-manifest.ts` serializes it into `sdui.manifest.json`
 * (the save-gate + parser whitelist) and into `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts` (the JSX
 * authoring surface), and for an array-of-objects input the ENTRY shape exists
 * nowhere else — `ComponentInput` has no member-shape slot, which is why the
 * repo-wide gate in `apps/console/src/__tests__/registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts`
 * (objectui#3797 / PR #3806) can only see top-level keys and says so in its
 * LIMIT note. An author following the retired spelling gets four silent layers:
 * `['a','b']` is a valid `array` to the manifest gate, upstream
 * `validateComponentProps` is advisory, the spec is only parsed on paths that
 * parse, and `RecordDetailsRenderer` reads `s.name` / `s.label` / `s.fields`
 * off each entry — all `undefined` on a string, so the section renders nothing.
 * Once `sections` is authored at all it is the ONLY source of the body, so the
 * page comes up blank with no diagnostic anywhere pointing at `sections`.
 * (That used to read "under `layout: 'custom'`". `layout` was removed in
 * @objectstack/spec 17.0.0 — its `auto` | `custom` semantics were never
 * implemented — and the body is now chosen by what you author: `sections`
 * renders the explicit groups, omitting it falls back to the object's
 * `highlightFields`. The blank-page failure this file guards is unchanged.)
 *
 * Every expectation below is DERIVED from the spec schema at runtime rather
 * than restating today's key list, so a spec change fails here instead of
 * quietly reopening the gap.

/**
 * objectui#3818 — the retired `layout` key, pinned on the published surface.
 *
 * `record:details` published `layout: enum ['auto','custom']` with
 * `defaultValue: 'auto'` and the description "auto uses the object
 * highlightFields; custom uses explicit sections". None of that was ever
 * implemented: the renderer's ONLY `schema.layout` read tested `'inline'` |
 * `'compact'` — two values the schema never permitted — so both legal values
 * fell through the same ternary to `'vertical'` and the key selected nothing.
 * A two-value enum whose values do the same thing is a false affordance with
 * zero diagnostics: an author writing `layout: 'custom'` believed it took
 * effect. @objectstack/spec 17.0.0 removed the key (objectstack#6946,
 * ADR-0087 D2) and the maintainer ruling of 2026-08-09 on objectui#3818 is
 * REMOVAL on this side too.
 *
 * Why these pins are not redundant with the derived gate above: a D2 tombstone
 * stays IN the shape (see `isTombstoned`), so every key-presence check kept
 * passing while the input was still published. The gate is now
 * tombstone-aware, and the assertions below name this key so the repair stays
 * legible if that helper is ever loosened.
