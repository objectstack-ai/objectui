/**
 * Which list views reached this console already translated (objectui#11295,
 * objectui#11336).
 *
 * ## Why a view label needs to know where it came from
 *
 * An object's switcher tabs, and the breadcrumb that names the open one, draw
 * views from three reads that the console merges into `objectDef.listViews`
 * (`MetadataProvider.mergeViewsIntoObjects`) and the overlay rows beside them:
 *
 *  - the `/meta/view` documents — view items, view overlays and saved views.
 *    The server translates every one of them for the request's locale
 *    (`translateView` in `@objectstack/spec`), and since objectstack#20731 it
 *    keeps a published edit over the packaged catalog: an explicit override
 *    beats the packaged default;
 *  - the `listViews` an OBJECT document embeds, read from `/meta/object`. Since
 *    objectstack#21072 (`@objectstack/spec` 17.6.0) the server's
 *    `translateObject` translates those too: from the same catalog address,
 *    `objects.<object>._views.<key>.label` with `<key>` the entry's record
 *    key, and by the same rule, a published edit kept over the packaged
 *    catalog;
 *  - entries the client derives itself — a stack container's expansion, the
 *    "all records" fallback tab — which no server translated.
 *
 * Running the client bundle over a served label is a SECOND translation pass:
 * the served label became the bundle's fallback, the bundle entry won it, and a
 * published edit drew as the packaged string (measured on objectstack#20730:
 * `进行中` on the zh-CN tab and breadcrumb over a served `In Progress
 * (edited-20730)`). Dropping the pass for every view would instead leave the
 * third kind untranslated. So the label sites ask, per view, the one question
 * that tells them apart: did a server read serve this view under its identity?
 *
 * ## The signal
 *
 * Two reads answer it, both out of `MetadataProvider`'s cache — the same
 * requests every merged view came from — and both by identity only: ⛔ no label
 * text is compared with anything.
 *
 *  - the `view` cache the `/meta/view` read fills, by the view's `name`, which
 *    is the tab id for every served view document;
 *  - the `object` cache the `/meta/object` read fills, as served: by the
 *    object's `name`, then the tab id as a key of that document's own
 *    `listViews`. It is read BEFORE the merge, because the merged `listViews`
 *    the label sites hold mixes the document's own entries with view documents
 *    and a container's expansion, and only the former were translated by
 *    `translateObject`. Only the canonical `listViews` key is read: the server
 *    translates no other spelling, so a view a stored document still embeds
 *    under the legacy `list_views` arrives untranslated and keeps the bundle.
 *
 * Outside a `MetadataProvider` both reads are empty, so every view keeps the
 * bundle composition it had before.
