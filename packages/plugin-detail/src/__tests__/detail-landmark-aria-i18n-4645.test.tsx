/**
 * The two remaining English landmark names on a record detail speak the
 * session locale — objectui#4645.
 *
 * `HeaderHighlight`'s `<section aria-label="Record highlights">` and
 * `RecordActivityTimeline`'s `<section aria-label="Discussion">` were the last
 * purely-ASCII accessible names on a record detail page, measured English in
 * zh-CN, ja-JP **and** es-ES — in es-ES sitting among 30+ correctly-Spanish
 * siblings (`Copiar ID de registro`, `Filtrar actividad`, `Alternar barra
 * lateral`). `HeaderHighlight`'s section carries no visible label of its own,
 * so its `aria-label` IS the landmark as far as assistive tech is concerned —
 * the argument objectui#4024 made for the dialog `Close` label, and #5956 made
 * for `record:path`'s own container name (`detail.pathLabel`, which this change
 * copies).
 *
 * ⚠️ Corrected 2026-09-24 (objectui#9998). This paragraph said BOTH sections
 * carry no visible label of their own. For `RecordActivityTimeline` that was
 * already false on the day it was written: its section has held a visible
 * `<h2>` reading `titleLabel ?? t('detail.activity')` plus an `(N)` count ever
 * since the section itself was introduced (2026-05-21, the de-boxing that
 * replaced the timeline's Card). So a `record:activity` mount, which passes no
 * `titleLabel`, was a landmark spoken "Discussion" under a heading reading
 * "Activity (N)" — against objectui#4118's rule that the landmark's spoken name
 * must be the heading. The timeline's section is now named BY that heading's
 * title text, so its cases below assert the locale's `detail.activity` where
 * they used to assert `detail.discussion`, and they read the computed
 * accessible name rather than an `aria-label` attribute it no longer carries.
 * What this file pins for it is unchanged: the landmark name is the session
 * locale's pack value, never an English literal, in all ten locales.
 *
 * Keys: `detail.discussion` already existed in all ten packs (the DetailView
 * tab reads it). `detail.highlightsLabel` is new and is the ONLY key this
 * change mints — added to all ten packs and mirrored byte-identically into
 * `DETAIL_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS`, which `defaults-maps-mirror-en-pack` enforces.
 *
 * ── Direction of these assertions ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * The `en` cases were GREEN before AND after: they pin that routing the names
 * through `t()` did not change what an English session hears. (For the
 * timeline that is history: objectui#9998 changed what an English session
 * hears there, "Discussion" to "Activity", on purpose — see above.) The zh / ja / es
 * cases were RED — both names read English in every locale, which is the whole
 * defect. The provider-less fallback is NOT asserted here: mounting an
 * `I18nProvider` installs a module-level i18next instance, so a no-provider
 * assertion in this file would read whichever instance a sibling test left
 * behind. It is covered instead by
 * `app-shell/src/__tests__/defaults-maps-mirror-en-pack.test.tsx`, which pins
 * every row of `DETAIL_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS` against the `en` pack.
