/**
 * The built-in pseudo-route switches must be SEGMENT tests, not substring
 * tests (objectui#3638).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `AppContent` decides whether a URL is one of the built-in pseudo-routes
 * (`create-app`, `system/*`, `metadata/*`, `setup`) before it decides which app
 * to render. Two of those switches were substring tests:
 *
 *     const isSystemRoute   = location.pathname.includes('/system');
 *     const isMetadataRoute = location.pathname.includes('/metadata');
 *
 * `includes('/system')` is true for any segment that merely STARTS with
 * `system` — `system_log`, `system_setting`, `systems` — and likewise for
 * `metadata` (`metadata_import`, `metadata-export`). `isSpecialRoute` feeds
 * `requestedAppMissing`, so a mistyped app name plus such a segment made the
 * "App not available" guard not fire, and the shell fell back to rendering the
 * DEFAULT app's chrome with the near-miss segment taken as its `:objectName` —
 * exactly what the comment above the fallback exists to prevent ("A normal
 * unmatched appName must NOT silently render a DIFFERENT app").
 *
 * ## Measure before tightening
 *
 * The looseness is load-bearing for real URLs today, so this file pins the live
 * input surface FIRST — every shape below was read off a route declaration or a
 * navigation target, not guessed:
 *
 *   route tables    console/AppContent.tsx     `system/marketplace{,/installed,/:packageId}`
 *                                              `metadata{,/_diagnostics,/:type,/:type/new,
 *                                               /:type/:name,/:type/:name/history}`
 *                                              `component/metadata/{directory,resource/*}`
 *   host extraRoutes apps/console/AppContent    `system`, `system/{apps,profile,approvals,
 *                                               ai-approvals,audit-log,settings,
 *                                               settings/:namespace,objects,objects/:objectName,
 *                                               metadata,metadata/:type,metadata/:type/:name}`
 *                                              (`developer/*` and `docs/*` are in the same
 *                                               fragment but flip NO flag — pinned below)
 *   navigation      UnifiedSidebar              `/apps/setup/system{,/apps,/marketplace,/users,
 *                                               /organizations,/roles,/settings}`
 *                                              `/apps/setup/metadata/{object,datasource}`
 *                   QuickActions                `/apps/setup/metadata/object`, `/apps/setup/system`
 *                   HomePage / InboxPopover     `/apps/setup/system/{marketplace,approvals}`
 *                   SystemRedirect (#3637)      bare `/system` -> `/apps/setup/system`
 *
 * The metadata-admin entries moved after #3638 landed: the sidebars'
 * `sys-objects` / `sys-datasources` items and the QuickActions "Manage Objects"
 * card once spelled `…/system/metadata/object` and
 * `…/component/metadata/resource?type=datasource`; #3739 and #3660 re-pointed
 * all three at the engine's canonical `…/metadata/:type` routes. Those two
 * older spellings are still in this input surface, as ARRIVALS rather than
 * emissions — declared in the two rows above
 * (`component/metadata/{directory,resource/*}` in the shell,
 * `system/metadata{,/:type}` in the host) and reached from bookmarks and
 * external links. `metadata` is a whole path segment either way, so the claim
 * below is indifferent to the move; the `navigation` row is re-read here
 * because a producer list naming URLs nothing emits any more is the stale
 * pointer objectui#3661 was paid for.
 *
 * In EVERY one of them `system` / `metadata` is a whole path segment, so a
 * segment test keeps all of them true. That is the claim this file's first two
 * describes exist to falsify.
 *
 * ## Where the two flags are actually load-bearing
 *
 * Not everywhere they are true. With a MATCHED app the flags change nothing
 * (`activeApp` is the matched app either way). They decide behaviour in exactly
 * two situations, and both are covered below:
 *
 *   1. the app segment does NOT resolve (stale bookmark, mistyped name) — the
 *      flags choose between the default-app fallback and "App not available";
 *   2. there is NO active app at all (a fresh, zero-app deployment) — the
 *      guards at the `!activeApp` branches key on `isSystemRoute` /
 *      `isMetadataRoute` directly (objectui#3590 / #3610).
 *
 * `/apps/setup/*` is a third family, but it rides `isSetupRoute`, which this
 * change does not touch; it is pinned here only as a boundary.
 *
 * ## Scope of the stubs
 *
 * This file measures ROUTING — which guard wins, which route matches, what ends
 * up on screen. Pages, the console chrome and the designer are stubbed; their
 * internals are other files' subject. `ConsoleLayout` is stubbed as a probe that
 * echoes `activeAppName`, which is what makes "silently rendered a DIFFERENT
 * app" an assertable fact rather than an inference.
 *
 * `systemRoutesStub` transcribes the host fragment from
 * `apps/console/src/AppContent.tsx` (`systemRoutes` + its `MetadataRedirect`).
 * app-shell cannot import from `apps/` — different Vitest project, and the
 * redirect is module-private — so the rewrite is copied verbatim, including its
 * `prefix` regex, and this comment is the pointer back to the original.
 *
 * ## Why the two host-rewrite cases assert the chain (objectui#3669)
 *
 * A transcription can go stale, and this one did. objectui#3658 re-pointed the
 * host straight at the canonical metadata routes; the copy below kept emitting
 * the deprecated `component/metadata/resource` alias, so both `system/metadata`
 * cases went on measuring a two-hop chain production had stopped producing.
 * Nothing went red — they pinned only the endpoint (or only the testid), and
 * the endpoint is byte-identical whether the alias sits in the middle or not.
 *
 * So `renderConsoleAt` returns every location the router settles on, and the
 * two cases fed by the stub assert that list exactly. A copy that drifts back
 * onto the alias grows a middle entry and fails, naming the alias in the diff.
 * The rest of the file is untouched by this: every other URL below reaches its
 * page without passing through the stub, and pinning their endpoints is the
 * right assertion for what they are about (which guard wins, which app's shell
 * rendered) — the hop count is not part of their claim.
