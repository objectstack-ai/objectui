/**
 * Regenerates `packages/cli/src/utils/known-schema-types.ts` — the set of
 * component `type` values `objectui check` treats as known — from the
 * registration calls in this repository's source.
 *
 * Run:    node scripts/regenerate-known-schema-types.mjs
 * Verify: node scripts/regenerate-known-schema-types.mjs --check
 * Exit:   0 = the committed file matches the derivation, 1 = it has drifted
 *         (under `--check`) or the derivation collapsed.
 *
 * ## Why this script exists (objectui#5115)
 *
 * `objectui check` used to judge `type` against a seventeen-entry array typed
 * by hand into `packages/cli/src/commands/check.ts`. Nothing kept that array
 * and the registry in agreement, and by the time it was measured it had
 * drifted in BOTH directions at once:
 *
 *   PHANTOMS  — in the list, registered by nothing. `crud` and `gallery`.
 *               `objectui check` said nothing about `{ "type": "crud" }` while
 *               `SchemaRenderer` painted the OBJUI-001 "Unknown component
 *               type" panel for it. A gate that blesses a type the runtime
 *               does not have is worse than no gate: the author gets a green
 *               light and finds out in the browser.
 *   MISSING   — registered, absent from the list: 221 bare keys plus every
 *               namespaced spelling. `{ "type": "object-grid" }` and
 *               `{ "type": "view:grid" }` — both real registry keys — were
 *               both reported as unknown. False warnings at that volume train
 *               authors to ignore the check, which costs the phantom direction
 *               its only reader.
 *
 * ## Why a generated snapshot rather than a runtime lookup
 *
 * The obvious fix — ask `ComponentRegistry` at runtime instead of keeping a
 * copy — was measured and does not work here, for two independent reasons:
 *
 *  1. `packages/cli` depends on `@object-ui/components` only. Of the fifteen
 *     entries in the old list that ARE registered, eleven (`kanban`,
 *     `calendar`, `dashboard`, `chart`, `detail`, `timeline`, `gantt`, `map`,
 *     `object-view`, `detail-view`, `object-chart`) are registered by plugin
 *     packages the CLI does not depend on. Reaching them means a CLI that
 *     pulls in React, recharts, maplibre and twenty sibling packages to answer
 *     one question about a string.
 *  2. Even then it would answer the wrong question. The published CLI runs in
 *     a USER's project, whose plugin set this repository cannot know. The
 *     honest claim the check can make is "this names a component the ObjectUI
 *     stack registers", and that claim is about source, not about whatever
 *     happens to be loaded in the CLI's own process.
 *
 * So the copy stays, and what changes is that it is DERIVED and PINNED instead
 * of typed: this script writes it, and
 * `scripts/__tests__/known-schema-types-derivation-5115.test.ts` fails the
 * build when the committed file and the derivation disagree in either
 * direction. Add a registration, run this script; the pin is what makes
 * forgetting impossible.
 *
 * ## One derivation, two consumers
 *
 * The key universe comes from `deriveRegistryKeys` in
 * `scripts/check-doc-component-types.mjs` — deliberately the SAME derivation
 * that judges documentation snippets (objectui#4823), not a second scanner
 * with its own bugs. It handles the forms this repo actually uses (registration
 * keys as literals, loops and declared indirect helpers; registration OPTIONS
 * as an object literal of key-value pairs and plain-identifier spreads, or an
 * identifier resolving to one such literal), and a registration form it cannot
 * resolve fails there rather than silently shrinking the universe here.
 *
 * ⚠️ That last clause is a PROPERTY OF THAT MODULE, not of this file, and this
 * header asserted it while it was false — which is why objectui#9641 exists at
 * all. A registration whose options arrive by reference, as
 * `register('app', PageRenderer, { ...pageMeta, label: 'App Page' })` with
 * `pageMeta.namespace` of `'ui'`, has no `namespace:` inside its own call span.
 * The derivation produced the bare half alone and reported NOTHING, so five
 * real runtime keys (`ui:page` `ui:app` `ui:utility` `ui:home` `ui:record`)
 * were missing from a generated list whose entire job is to say which keys are
 * real, and `objectui check` called documents spelling them unknown while the
 * renderer painted them.
 *
 * ⛔ The first repair for that fixed the two shapes this tree uses and left
 * seven siblings — a cast, a member expression, a call, three spread variants
 * and a computed `namespace` — falling through to the same silent reading,
 * while this paragraph re-asserted the clause. Restating a false invariant
 * beside a partial fix is the original defect one layer up, and it is the
 * reason the derivation now works from an ALLOWLIST: two options shapes are
 * read and every other shape is an `unresolved-registration-meta` finding.
 * That is what makes the clause above a description of the code rather than a
 * hope about it; `deriveRegistryKeys` is where to check it, and its own header
 * and fixture pins are what hold it.
 *
 * The repair belongs there and not here for the reason this section already
 * gives: a second resolver in this file would be the second scanner it exists
 * to refuse.
 *
 * The universe is taken WHOLE, with no filtering — bare keys, namespaced keys
 * and the `protocol-placeholder:` spellings alike. A filter would be a second
 * rule to keep honest, and the check's question ("does this name something
 * registered") has the same answer for all of them.
