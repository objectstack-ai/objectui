/**
 * objectui#10585 — the Hook inspector's object picker makes its two claims
 * only from a roster that ANSWERED.
 *
 * The picker makes two claims from the object catalog `useObjectOptions`
 * fetches: a selected object the catalog does not list is flagged
 * `(not published)`, and an empty list prints "No objects found — publish an
 * object, then pick it here." Both used to be read off `options` alone, and
 * `options` is `[]` while the fetch is in flight and after it failed — exactly
 * what a catalog with no objects leaves. So every selected object was called
 * unpublished, and the author was told to publish one, before the catalog had
 * spoken and, on a failed fetch, permanently.
 *
 * The rule is the one objectui#8862 / objectui#9651 set for the designer's
 * pickers, and the arms are the ones `ViewColumnInspector.rosterFailure.test.tsx`
 * pins for that inspector:
 *
 *   • in flight   → no flag, no "publish" copy, no failure notice
 *   • FAILED      → no flag, no "publish" copy, plus a notice naming the cause
 *   • answered, object genuinely absent → flag, and an empty answered catalog
 *                   still prints the "publish" copy (the controls that the
 *                   claims still fire when they are true)
 *
 * The real `useObjectOptions` runs; only the metadata client is stubbed, and
 * its `list` is settled by the test.
