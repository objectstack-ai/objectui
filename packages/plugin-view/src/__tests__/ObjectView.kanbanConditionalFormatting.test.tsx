/**
 * Kanban `conditionalFormatting` is authored where it is DECLARED, and nowhere
 * else (objectui#5248).
 *
 * ## What this pins, and why it is a contract test rather than a refactor test
 *
 * `generateViewSchema`'s kanban branch resolves the rule list from a chain. Two
 * links are declared surface:
 *
 *   - `options.kanban.conditionalFormatting` — `ObjectKanbanSchema` declares it
 *     (`packages/types/src/objectql.ts`, zod contract pinned in
 *     `packages/types/src/__tests__/kanban-conditional-formatting.test.ts`).
 *   - the active/named view's own `conditionalFormatting` — the view definition
 *     declares it, and it is what Studio's CEL editor writes.
 *
 * A third link used to sit at the end: `(schema as any).conditionalFormatting`,
 * read straight off the `object-view` node. Nothing declared it —
 * `ObjectViewSchema` has no such member, the `object-view` registry
 * registration does not publish it in `inputs`, and `BaseSchema`'s index
 * signature meant tsc said nothing either. It was honoured anyway, because this
 * branch runs exactly when no host supplied `renderListView` — the path the
 * REGISTERED renderer takes.
 *
 * That made it the one counter-example to the objectui#5097 exemption, whose
 * stated basis is that its 27 keys are reachable only through the host-supplied
 * delegation. Maintainer ruling 2026-08-19 (verbatim 「全部接受」, recorded on
 * objectui#5248): Option 2, gated on a liveness check — Option 1 (declare the
 * key on `ObjectViewSchema` + registry `inputs`) had the check found real
 * authored usage. The check came back empty, so the read was dropped.
 *
 * ## The half that must NOT move
 *
 * The key stays HOST surface. The `renderListView` delegation still reads it
 * off the object-view node and forwards it to the host's list renderer — a
 * stored app-shell document that carries it must keep working. The last
 * describe below is that half, asserted from the same file so the two cannot
 * drift apart: narrowing one is a ruling, narrowing both is a bug.
