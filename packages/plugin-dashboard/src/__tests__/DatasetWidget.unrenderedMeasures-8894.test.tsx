/**
 * objectui#8894 — a dataset widget that queries a measure and never shows it
 * must SAY SO. It must not start rendering it.
 *
 * The query runs every measure the author declared (`measures: values`), and
 * the tile branch of `DatasetWidget` renders ONE of them. That drop used to be
 * silent: a tile answering a narrower question than its metadata asked, looking
 * like a finished product (ADR-0049 declared-but-unenforced). The diagnostic
 * pinned here keeps it audible.
 *
 * ## What changed since the first half of this card (PR objectui#8905)
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.5.0 narrowed `values` to ONE measure on the metric
 * family (ruling D on the card; objectui's `DashboardWidgetSchema` re-attaches
 * the spec's check). A metric tile with two measures is therefore refused at
 * every door, and reaches the renderer only as a document stored before the
 * narrowing. A dimensionless widget of a type the spec's text gives no
 * rendering of several measures (a `pie`, say) still passes every door and
 * still takes the tile, until the spec refuses that shape (objectstack#20958).
 *
 * So the diagnostic's condition is no longer "the widget is a metric tile with
 * more than one measure": it is "a declared measure is not rendered", the set
 * difference between `values` and what the chosen branch renders
 * (`renderedMeasures` in the component). Its text names the dropped measures
 * and points to the spec's replacement — the ADR-0087 entry of the
 * metric-family refusal — and names no widget types and gives no advice of its
 * own. The pins for that are the four triage set on the card, spread over this
 * file and `DatasetWidget.dimensionlessMeasures-11261.test.tsx` (where the
 * dimensionless `column` / `horizontal-bar` rows draw every measure):
 *
 *   - a dimensionless `pie` with two measures warns and names the dropped one;
 *   - a stored two-measure `metric` warns;
 *   - a dimensionless `table` does not warn (the control);
 *   - a dimensionless `horizontal-bar` renders three measures with no warning
 *     (in the 11261 file, beside the other dimensionless charts).
 *
 * ⛔ Still not done here, on purpose: rendering `values[1..]` on a tile.
 * objectui#8887 pins the drop itself and the byte-identity of a tile that
 * declares no sub-caption; both stay green, and the DOM control at the bottom of
 * this file measures the same thing from this card's side.
 *
 * Subjects vs controls: every `SUBJECT` asserts something a broken diagnostic
 * fails — silenced, or saying something false — and every `CONTROL` is green
 * either way and is here to catch a change that overshoots into noise or into
 * rendering what it should only report.
 *
 * No `dist/` is involved: the root `vitest.config.mts` aliases every
 * `@object-ui/*` specifier to that package's `src/`, and this file imports
 * `../DatasetWidget` relatively, so an ablation of the diagnostic reads source
 * directly.
