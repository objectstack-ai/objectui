 * Default list columns for an object that declares no explicit list view.

 * Priority: the object's name field ALWAYS leads (see below); then the

 * no field def); otherwise the first `limit` business fields in declared order.
 * Framework-injected system / audit / ownership columns are excluded via the
 * shared `isSystemManagedField` classifier — its single source of truth is the
 * spec `system` flag stamped by `applySystemFields`, with a name-set fallback
 * covering the injected, non-hidden / non-readonly `owner_id` and
 * `organization_id`. Without this, `applySystemFields` (which spreads injected
 * fields to the FRONT of the field map) would surface `owner_id` as a leading
 * raw-id column (#2702, #2777).
 *
 * The name-field lead is `leadWithNameField` from `@object-ui/core`
 * (objectui#7245). `highlightFields` is NOT a column list — it is ADR-0085's
 * "most important fields", and its first consumer, the detail highlight strip,
 * deliberately DROPS the title field because the page H1 above it already shows
 * one. So metadata that is entirely well-authored routinely omits the name:
 * `showcase_account` declares `["status", "industry", "annual_revenue"]` and its
 * default grid rendered 14 rows a user could not tell apart. A list has no H1,
 * so the same role needs the opposite treatment here. Applied to BOTH branches:
 * the fallback walk is declaration-ordered, so an object whose name field is
 * declared late lost it off the end of the `limit` slice.
 *
 * `opts.orgAttribution` (ADR-0105 group posture): reads span every
 * organization the member belongs to, so cross-org rows need attribution —
 * append `organization_id` as a TRAILING column when the object carries the
 * field. Trailing keeps business fields leading; render-time only, never
 * persisted into saved view metadata (a saved view must not fossilize a
 * posture-dependent column set).

/**
 * The `options.timeline` config this page hands to `ListView`.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT resolve the date axis. `ListView.resolveTimelineDateBinding`
 * is the single read-site that decides which field a timeline buckets by, and it
 * reads the calendar binding when the view carries no timeline one. This face used
 * to fabricate `startDateField: 'due_date'` for every object view — a field name
 * the view never declared and most objects do not have — which both looked like a
 * real binding downstream and, because it is always present, shadowed the calendar
 * fallback entirely. The result on a calendar-bound view was a Timeline the
 * switcher offered and the renderer bucketed wholly into "No date" (objectui#3129).
 *
 * What stays here is the view's OWN declared config, floored at `'name'`. An
 * object-level `objectDef.titleField` leg used to sit in the middle of that
 * chain; it was removed in objectui#6557 because `@objectstack/spec`'s object
 * schema is a `strictObject` that REJECTS the key with `unrecognized_keys`, so
 * no legal object metadata could ever reach it (objectui#6531 established the
 * measurement, and dropped the twin read inside `getRecordDisplayName`).
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THE SIBLING BRANCHES BELOW ACTUALLY DO (objectui#7070). The sentence
 * above used to end "— the same two-rung shape the calendar and gantt branches
 * below already use", and for gantt that was FALSE the whole time it stood: the
 * gantt branch floored `startDateField` / `endDateField` at `'start_date'` /
 * `'end_date'`, which is precisely the one-rung fabrication this note declares
 * retired. A note is the authority the next fixer consults, so it vouched for
 * the lines that were broken. Each branch is therefore stated as MEASURED, not
 * as a family:
 *
 *   - `calendarViewOptions` below — forwards a declared block or emits no
 *     `calendar` key at all; it never floors a date axis (objectui#7029).
 *   - `ganttViewOptions` below — forwards the declared block, title floored at
 *     `'name'`, and invents neither date field. Its `'start_date'` / `'end_date'`
 *     floors were deleted by objectui#7070; that is what makes `ObjectGantt`'s
 *     own "Gantt configuration required" screen reachable from this route.
 *   - the TIMELINE axis at the two SIBLING FACES — `plugin-list/ListView.tsx`
 *     and `plugin-view/ObjectView.tsx`. Both floored `startDateField` at
 *     `'created_at'`, the very literal objectui#3129 retired HERE, and
 *     `ListView` carried it as a stated DECISION ("`created_at` stays the last
 *     resort for a view that declares no date axis anywhere") — two faces
 *     holding documented and OPPOSITE postures on one field name. That is what
 *     objectui#7070 routed to a single ruling instead of settling per-face, and
 *     the ruling (2026-09-01, 总监批 #28) answered it as house posture:
 *     日期轴永不虚构 — a date axis is never fabricated. Its step ③ deleted both
 *     floors, so all three faces now forward a declared axis or none, and
 *     `ObjectTimeline`'s own refusal screen (step ①, objectui#7459) is reachable
 *     from every one of them. This note no longer describes only THIS face.

 * `galleryViewOptions` family above, and the last one still inlined as an
 * anonymous IIFE inside the schema literal (objectui#8193).
 *
 * ⭐ THE LANE KEY IS `groupByField`, THE SPEC'S OWN SPELLING. This used to emit
 * the legacy `groupField` alias instead — never the canonical key, even though
 * it already READ the canonical key first. The sibling producer
 * `defaultKanbanFromObject` (`InterfaceListPage.tsx`) had migrated already and
 * left the reasoning next to itself — "that read-site now prefers the spec key,
 * so one key is enough" — but this twin twelve hundred lines away was not
 * carried along, so ONE producer surface spoke two vocabularies for one concept
 * depending on which entry point you arrived through.
 *
 * ⚠️ The alias is NOT retired and every alias READ stays exactly as it was:
 * stored metadata still authors `groupField`, and `ListView` resolving
 * `groupByField || groupField` is the whole reason the sibling could drop it.
 * What changed is only what this face WRITES.
 *
 * ⚠️ WRITING THE CANONICAL KEY HERE REQUIRED THE GATE TO LEARN IT, and that is
 * the half a reader will not guess from this file. `ListView.availableViews`
 * consulted the `options.<kind>` bag for the LEGACY spelling only
 * (`schema.options?.kanban?.groupField`), so emitting `groupByField` alone made
 * the Kanban capability stop resolving and the toggle vanish from every object
 * view — measured, not reasoned: `{groupBy, groupField}` offered Kanban, and
 * `{groupBy, groupByField}` did not. The gate now reads both spellings out of
 * the bag, the same one-question-two-sites repair objectui#5042 made for `map`
 * and objectui#7544 for `chart`. Pinned in `ObjectView.kanbanLane-8193` here
 * and in `ListView.kanbanOptionsBagCanonical-8193` in `plugin-list`.
 *
 * ⭐ `groupBy` IS RETIRED HERE (objectui#8213) — the THIRD spelling of the one
 * concept this expression already writes canonically. Measured against
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0's strict `KanbanConfigSchema`, which declares
 * `groupByField` / `summarizeField` / `columns` and refuses `groupBy` BY NAME,
 * on a call where one control fires (`zzzBogusKey` is refused by name) and
 * another accepts (`groupByField` alone draws no `unrecognized_keys`). Upstream
 * knows the OTHER alias by name — probing `groupField` answers "Did you mean
 * `groupField` → `groupByField`?" — and knows nothing at all about `groupBy`.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE PRODUCER CENSUS THE CARD MADE A PRECONDITION, run before the deletion.
 * A structural scan of every tracked file for a bare `groupBy` inside a
 * view-level `kanban`/`calendar`/`gallery`/`timeline`/`gantt` object literal
 * found NO runtime producer but this one; the lit control on the same
 * instrument (`groupByField` in the same position) returned 58 sites, so the
 * empty reading is a reading. The only other authors are FIXTURES: the two arms
 * of `ListView.kanbanOptionsBagCanonical-8193` that pin this very bag, and one
 * stale metadata payload in `data-objectstack`'s `updateView.draft.test.ts`.
 * The sibling producer `defaultKanbanFromObject` emits `{ groupByField }` alone
 * and always has.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THE ONE READER IS UNHARMED. `ListView`'s two projection/expand
 * collectors list `v.groupByField, v.groupField, v.groupBy` as candidates for
 * the same lane value, so `groupBy` did contribute a field NAME to the query
 * projection — and this same expression writes that identical value under
 * `groupByField`, which those collectors read first. The capability gate never
 * read `groupBy` at all (it resolves `groupByField || groupField` on both
 * nestings), and neither does the render branch (`groupByField || groupField ||
 * detectStatusField(...)`).
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS CLOSED AND WHAT IT DID NOT — and what has since closed the rest.
 * `ListView`'s kanban branch destructured
 * `columns`/`groupByField`/`groupField`/`cardFields`/`titleField` out of the
 * merged config and spread the REST *after* its own `groupBy: laneField`, so a
 * surviving `groupBy` overrode the lane it had just resolved. This deletion
 * removed the only producer in this repo that fed that override; the override
 * itself stayed reachable from an author-written `kanban.groupBy` riding this
 * repo's `.passthrough()` mirror, and was carried on its own card.
 * ⭐ THAT CARD HAS LANDED (objectui#8365, maintainer ruling of 2026-09-12 —
 * decision batch #117 item 5, option B): `groupBy` is now stripped in
 * `ListView`'s destructure, so the canonical lane wins, AND the view-level
 * `KanbanConfig` mirror (`@object-ui/types`, `zod/objectql.zod.ts`) declares it
 * as an alias refusal naming `groupByField`, so the key is refused BY NAME at
 * the read door instead of riding the passthrough. ⛔ Do not re-file it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `titleField` AND `cardFields` BELOW ARE ALSO OUTSIDE `KanbanConfigSchema`,
 * and are deliberately NOT swept up here. `cardFields` is a DECLARED deprecated
 * alias of the spec's `columns` in this repo's own `KanbanConfig` mirror
 * (`@object-ui/types`), and `titleField` is live — `ListView` forwards it onto
 * the generated node. Neither is a second spelling of a key this expression
 * already writes correctly, which is the whole of objectui#8213. They are
 * pinned as the KNOWN residual in `ObjectView.kanbanGroupByRetired-8213`, so a
 * fourth undeclared key reddens instead of joining them quietly.
 *
 * ADR-0085: when the view doesn't pick a lane field, the object's declared
 * lifecycle (`stageField`) decides — including the strict `stageField: false`
 * suppression (no default lanes; the status-shaped field is declared
 * non-linear) and the shared name/type heuristic, which never invents a field
 * the object doesn't have (the old hard-coded 'status' did).

 * left with a click-only `span role="link"`. The list host publishes the same
 * pair here, so `LinkCell` can render a real anchor without knowing anything
 * about routes — one mechanism, all three surfaces.
 *
 * Two deliberate limits:
 *
 *  - **`resolve` returns no handlers.** This surface has no related lists — a
 *    list page's rows are not a child collection — so there is nothing to
 *    resolve. An empty handler set is exactly what the context documents as
 *    "capability unavailable", i.e. the same read-only outcome a consumer gets
 *    with no provider at all, so nothing that renders under this page gains an
 *    affordance it did not have.
 *  - **`recordHref` addresses THIS view's object only.** {@link
 *    listRecordDetailUrl} is derived from the current list's pathname, so it
 *    can only name records of the object being listed; any other object is
 *    `null`, which consumers must render as the plain value (a lookup cell
 *    pointing at a third object stays exactly as it renders today). The
 *    console-wide, any-object builder lives on the detail page's bridge, which
 *    has the routable-object set this page does not.
 *
 * `pathname` is read at CALL time (not captured) so a view switch or a drill-in
 * cannot leave a stale base behind — the same freshness rule the bridge's
 * builder documents for its `?from=` trail.
 *
 * Exported for the pin test.

 * - REJECTS → the adapter could not tell, which is NOT the same fact as
 *   "nothing is there". Fall through to the per-view reads.
 *
 * An adapter that swallows its own failures into `{}` collapses those two into

/**
 * Strip conditions an overlay must never impose, and drop the `filter` key
 * entirely when nothing effective is left (objectui#4155).
 *
 * A view override is merged over the source-declared view as `{ ...source,
 * ...override }`, so its `filter` key REPLACES the view's declared filter
 * wholesale. That made two overlay bodies destructive:
 *
 *   `filter: [{ field: 'x', operator: 'equals', value: '' }]`
 *        — an incomplete filter-panel row. The live query never applied it
 *          (`convertFilterGroupToAST` skips empty values), but as a stored
 *          overlay it became the view's ENTIRE filter and returned `total: 0`:
 *          the "empty list that used to have rows" this issue reports.
 *   `filter: []`
 *        — what "Clear all" wrote. Not a poisoned filter, but still an override
 *          that silently deletes the source declaration (an archived-records
 *          exclusion, say) for everyone.
 *
 * Both are neutralized HERE, on the read path, so an install already carrying a
 * poisoned row self-heals on the next load rather than needing a `sys_metadata`
 * delete plus a service restart. The write that created them is gone too (the
 * filter panel no longer persists anything) — this is the recovery half.
 *
 * Consequence, deliberate and worth naming: an overlay can no longer express
 * "this view has NO filter" over a source view that declares one. That is the
 * strictly safer side of the trade — the shape that expressed it is the same
 * shape that silently erased source declarations, and an author who genuinely
 * wants no filter edits the view (an explicit save), which writes the view body
 * rather than an overlay.
 *
 * Filter entries are matched in both at-rest shapes: spec `ViewFilterRule`
 * objects (`{ field, operator, value }`, what the fold writes) and the legacy
 * runtime triple `[field, operator, value]` a source view may declare and which
 * `persistViewPatch` USED TO copy into the overlay along with the rest of the
 * view — it now stores the patch alone (objectui#5233,
 * {@link buildPersistedViewBody}), so a triple can only reach this pass from a
 * row written before that landed, or from a saved view's own body.
 *
 * Whether a matched entry's VALUE counts as supplied is asked of the builder's
 * own {@link isFilterValueComplete}, not of a local predicate (objectstack#8815,
 * objectui#5025). This pass used to spell the question out here:
 *
 * ```ts
 * value == null || value === '' || (Array.isArray(value) && value.length === 0)
 * ```
 *
 * — right for `scalar` and `list`, blind to `pair`. A `between` carrying one
 * bound is `['2024-01-01', '']`, an array of length 2, so the recovery pass read
 * it as a real condition and handed it back. That is the one shape this pass
 * most needs to strip: `ViewFilterRuleSchema` ACCEPTS a half-filled range
 * (measured on `@objectstack/spec` 17.1.0 — it counts the two slots, not what is
 * in them), so authoring validation is green on it and it only dies at query
 * time, where the server refuses the WHOLE view (`400 INVALID_FILTER`) for every
 * user on every later read. The builder's two write paths were converted to the
 * arity-aware reading; this is the read-path half, and it was the third verbatim
 * copy of a predicate that had already been indicted twice.
 *
 * The split of duties is the helper's own: it answers the VALUE question only,
 * while which operators want no value at all stays with
 * {@link VALUELESS_FILTER_OPERATORS} above — this layer additionally sees the
 * canonical spec spellings (`is_null`) that never reach the dropdown.

 * Build the switcher's tab list — the ONE place a tab's identity is decided

 *
 * Views reach this function from two independent reads of the same

 *
 *   - `definedViews` — `objectDef.listViews`, keyed by the composer's runtime
 *     identity (`MetadataProvider.applyViewItem`, `<object>.<key>`);
 *   - `savedViews` — the adapter's `listViews()` overlay rows, keyed by
 *     {@link viewRowId}.
 *
 * The two must produce the SAME string for the same view, because everything
 * downstream that decides whether a view is mutable — the tab's `readonly`
 * flag, `isSavedView`, and the early return in every mutating handler — asks
 * whether the tab's id is among the overlay keys. When they disagreed, a saved
 * view was presented as a system view: its set-default / rename / delete menu
 * entries were not rendered at all, so the click the QA run reported produced
 * no adapter write because there was nothing left to click.
 *
 * They disagreed because the metadata side spelled identity `{ id: key,
 * ...body, ...override }` — `id` FIRST, so an `id` key inside the stored body
 * or the stored override silently replaced it. Both are stored documents that
 * really do carry one: `persistViewPatch` WROTE the whole tab object (its `id`
 * included) back through `updateViewConfig` — since objectui#5233 it writes the
 * patch alone for an overlay ({@link buildPersistedViewBody}) but still the
 * whole body for a saved view's own row, and every row written before that
 * landed still carries an `id` — and a duplicated view copies its
 * source artifact's `id` verbatim. `viewEntry` stamps identity LAST at all
 * three sites, so the tab id is now a property of the key the caller looked the
 * view up by, and can never be a property of the data.
 *
 * Extracted from the `views` memo so the seam is assertable without mounting
 * the view; the memo still owns the concerns that need render context (default
 * columns, labels, the per-user sort).
 *
 * @param fallbackTab - the auto-generated "all records" tab, built lazily
 *   because it needs the translated label and the object's default columns.

 * 到不了带 overlay 的用户,这与 per-user 之争无关,是纯粹的存储形状错误。」
 *
 * ## Why the two branches are not one
 *
 * `updateViewConfig` persists through `client.meta.saveItem`, which is a **PUT
 * of the whole document** — the adapter's own `updateView` reads the current row
 * and merges onto it precisely because `saveItem` does not ("there is nothing to
 * merge onto. Fail loudly instead of emitting the partial write"). So what this
 * function returns is what the row BECOMES, not what is layered onto it:
 *
 * - **`isSavedView: false`** — a code-defined *system* view. The row is a
 *   personalization OVERLAY laid on top of a definition that lives elsewhere;
 *   nothing in it but the patch is an opinion the user expressed. Store the
 *   patch. The source view is then free to change under it, which is the card.
 * - **`isSavedView: true`** — a genuinely user-created *saved* view. The row IS
 *   the view; there is no source underneath it to shadow, so the ruled harm
 *   cannot arise here. A patch-only PUT would not narrow this row, it would
 *   **delete the user's view definition** — its `config`/`columns`/`filter`/
 *   `label` are not a frozen copy of anything, they are the view. This branch
 *   therefore still carries the body, byte-identical to the pre-fix write.
 *
 * The same `isSavedViewId` classification already decides the switcher's
 * readonly flag, its five mutating handlers, and whether `updateViewConfig`
 * stamps the overlay marker — so a row cannot be a saved view for one of them
 * and an overlay for another.
 *
 * ## What the overlay branch keeps besides the patch
 *
 * `viewKind` only, and only when the active tab carries one — **identity, not
 * content**, the same line `VIEW_OVERLAY_IDENTITY_KEYS`
 * (`@object-ui/data-objectstack`) draws on the read side, so the write now
 * produces exactly the shape the reader would keep. `object`, `name` and the
 * overlay marker are stamped by `updateViewConfig` itself; `label` is
 * deliberately NOT kept (the platform inherits it from the shadowed registry
 * entry — a stored one is a snapshot of the source view's label at write time,
 * which is the very class of frozen key this narrowing exists to stop).
 *
 * The patch is written verbatim rather than filtered through
 * `VIEW_OVERLAY_OWNED_KEYS`: every call site passes exactly the one key the
 * user just changed, and a filter here would SILENTLY drop a sixth key someone
 * later persists. The ratchet in `ObjectView.overlayPatchOnly.test.ts` is what
 * makes that drift loud instead.
 *
 * ## Consequence for rows written before this shipped
 *
 * They are fat at rest and stay that way until touched — already harmless on
 * read since PR #5272 narrowed the merge (`sanitizeViewOverride` →
 * `narrowPersonalizationOverlay`). Because this write is a full-document PUT,
 * the next toolbar toggle on such a view **replaces** the fat row with the thin
 * one. So the issue's three dispositions land as: tolerate on read (shipped),
 * strip on next write (here), no migration — and both halves are pinned.
 *
 * Extracted from `persistViewPatch` so the write shape is assertable without
 * mounting the view, the same reason `buildViewTabs`, `setDefaultViewPatches`
 * and `reorderViewPatches` above are exported.
