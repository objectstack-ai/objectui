/**
 * objectui#8355 — THE SECOND ROUTE to `ObjectCalendar`, and the one the first
 * two rounds of this card missed.
 *
 * `generateViewSchema` runs precisely when no host supplied `renderListView` —
 * the authored `object-view` element — so it never passes through `ListView`,
 * and the strip this card landed in `plugin-list` does not reach it. Its own
 * `case 'calendar':` comment has said "the SECOND route to `ObjectCalendar`"
 * since objectui#7029; the same distinction the kanban branch records for
 * objectui#9242 one card over.
 *
 * ## ⭐ WHY THIS FILE IS PART OF THE RETIREMENT AND NOT A FOLLOW-UP
 *
 * The retirement removed `ObjectCalendar`'s alias ladder. On THIS route the
 * producer kept spreading `...(viewOptions.calendar || {})` raw, so a document
 * that drew at the merge-base stopped drawing at head — the exact shape the
 * ruling calls not-ruled ("removed the ladder while the producer kept spreading
 * the alias, so documents failed silently"). A follow-up card cannot un-ship
 * that; the regression and its remedy belong to the same delivery.
 *
 * ## MEASURED BEFORE ANY MECHANISM WAS CHOSEN
 *
 * This file was written and run against the UNMODIFIED head (`c82937e3b`),
 * which is the strongest form of the reverse-verification leg: the "before" arm
 * is the real tree rather than an injected mutation, so there is no on-disk
 * mutation to prove and no restore leg to get wrong (the objectui#9242 idiom,
 * one card over, for the same reason). Predicted, then observed, on `c82937e3b`:
 *
 *   - half 1 (the emitted node) RED — the node carries a flat `dateField` /
 *     `endField` and no `startDateField`;
 *   - half 2 (the read door) RED — `safeValidateSchema` ACCEPTS the document;
 *   - every CONTROL green.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND ONE PREMISE DIED ON CONTACT. The read-door gap is NOT this PR's doing
 * and is NOT specific to the calendar: measured in the same pass, a named view
 * carrying the objectui#8365 stray `kanban.groupBy` was ACCEPTED here too, while
 * the identical key on a `list-view` document was refused (objectui#10321 has
 * since added that key to this door; the reading below is the one taken
 * then). `ObjectViewSchema`'s
 * `listViews` is unmirrored by ruling and rides `.passthrough()`, so NOTHING
 * that lands on a view-kind block reaches a named view. ⇒ what this card
 * regressed on this route is the BEHAVIOUR (drew → mute); the silence at the
 * door was already there, for every alias refusal this module carries.
 *
 * ## THE REFUSAL'S SHAPE HERE, and why it is not a mirror
 *
 * `listViews` stayed unmirrored when this file was written, waiting on its
 * VALUE TYPE. objectui#7928 answered that (ruling A): the key is the protocol's
 * strict `ObjectListViewSchema` record by reference now, so the protocol refuses
 * both spellings under `listViews.KEY.calendar` itself. The `.check()` this
 * card added stays beside that member, still not the mirror: it reads the
 * protocol's refusal and adds the by-name pointer at the key (the protocol's own
 * hint answers `dateField` → `endDateField`). The legacy `options.calendar`
 * nesting is refused WHOLE now (`options` is not a member) and is no longer read
 * off a named view; a stored body's bag is folded at `ViewPreview`
 * (objectui#7928 director ruling, Q1 A). The scope controls below were
 * inverted to that tree, ⛔ none deleted.
