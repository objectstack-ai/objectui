/**
 * A wizard STEP — the wizard's OWN authored group shape (objectui#6237).
 *
 * ## Why this is declared here rather than derived from the tabbed layout
 *
 * It used to be `Omit<FormSectionConfig, 'visibleWhen'>`, which subtracted the
 * predicate slot from `TabbedForm`'s section type. That closed the hole for the
 * ONE key it named and left the mechanism wide open: `FormSectionConfig` is the
 * predicate-CARRYING type, so every key added to it lands here by default and
 * the author has to remember to widen the `Omit`. The defect the 2026-08-30
 * ruling closes is the SILENCE — "在共享 `FormSectionConfig` 上声明 `visibleWhen`
 * 会**静默**给 WizardForm 的 step 也发一个谓词槽而那侧无实现" — and a subtractive
 * derivation reproduces that silence for the next key in the same family
 * (`readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen`, both already this repo's field-level
 * predicate vocabulary). Declaring the step shape independently flips the
 * derivation from subtractive to additive: a key reaches a wizard step only
 * because someone wrote it here, on the type whose renderer has to honour it.
 *
 * This is also simply the house pattern. `SplitFormSectionConfig`,
 * `ModalFormSectionConfig` and `DrawerFormSectionConfig` each declare their own
 * group shape, each documents `className` / `gridClassName` in ITS layout's
 * terms, and each declares `visibleWhen` only because its layout honours it
 * (`SplitFormSectionConfig` even carries a key — `pane` — that exists nowhere
 * else). The wizard borrowing the tabbed layout's interface was the exception,
 * and it cost real accuracy: a wizard author reading the shared type was told
 * `name` is "used as tab value", `label` is "used as tab trigger text", and
 * `className` is "Unused in the tabbed layout" — while this renderer uses all
 * three, `className` at the step container (`FormSectionContainer` below).
 *
 * ## ⛔ Why there is no predicate slot, and why that is not an oversight
 *
 * A step predicate is not a port of the tab predicate, it is a different
 * contract. Steps are wizard component state keyed by section INDEX, only the
 * current step is mounted (unmounted-ness is every other step's NORMAL state,
 * which is why the final gate re-checks the whole declared field set), and the
 * predicate would read `formData` — which merges only at step boundaries. So a
 * step predicate is structurally STEP-BOUNDARY reactive where a tab's is ruled
 * LIVE-RECORD reactive: one keyword, two different "when". It also needs
 * machinery none of which is inherited — navigation policy for skipping hidden
 * steps, the indicator, `isLastStep`, the "Step X of Y" denominator, index
 * stability while hiding is live, re-selection when the CURRENT step hides, and
 * a final-gate exclusion for a hidden step's required fields.
 *
 * Declaring the key on a type this renderer ignores would make it WRITABLE on a
 * step — precisely the declared-but-unenforced shape this card family exists to
 * close. Its absence means TypeScript rejects the key on a wizard step literal,
 * which is where an author (or an agent authoring metadata) finds out.
 * `ObjectForm` additionally reports the gap at runtime for a section predicate
 * arriving on the wizard route, since untyped JSON reaches it too. Both halves
 * are pinned in `__tests__/tabbedFormSectionPredicate-6237.test.tsx`, including
 * a FAMILY-level pin that fails the build if any `*When` key ever appears here,
 * not just the one this card was about.
 *
 * Since the objectstack#13622 ruling (2026-08-31), the boundary is also an
 * AUTHOR-door refusal: `@objectstack/spec` refuses `visibleWhen` (and
 * `collapsible`/`collapsed: true`) on a wizard step at parse, so authored
 * form-view metadata carrying them never reaches this renderer at all. This
 * type and the runtime report remain the guard for what the spec door cannot
 * see — programmatic SDUI callers and metadata published before the
 * tightening. The step-predicate FUTURE contract stays tracked in
 * objectui#6237; the spec-side refusal is its single opening point.
 *
 * ⚠️ This changes nothing that used to work. The published surface is exactly
 * the key set `WizardStepConfig` already had — the derivation changed, not the
 * type — and `visibleWhen` was already a type error on a wizard step literal.

 * missing is one fact, and only one: the navigation the author declared did not
 * happen. Before this, the toast was byte-identical to the toast a form with no
 * `navigateOnSuccess` at all produces, so an author who mistyped the destination
 * — or whose record carried no usable id — saw a form that looked entirely
 * healthy and had silently stopped honouring a key they wrote.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-17: "A refused declared navigation is surfaced: the
 * success toast carries a note that the declared navigation was not performed —
 * never indistinguishable from the no-key case."
 *
 * The note names no REASON on purpose. `resolveSuccessNavigate` answers null for
 * two different causes (no usable id on the written record; a destination the
 * same-origin guard refused) and returns no discriminant, so a reason in this
 * copy could only be re-derived by reimplementing that helper's internals at the
 * call site — where it would drift from the helper, and would additionally bake
 * an acceptance rule into user-visible prose, which objectui#5034 has since
 * narrowed once already. The diagnosable detail — the template the author
 * actually wrote — goes to `console.warn` at each call site instead.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in `successBehavior.ts` (the natural home, but read-only
 * for this card) and is imported BY `ObjectForm`, which is the dependency
 * direction that already exists — ObjectForm imports WizardForm, never the
 * reverse. Single-sourced so a wizard and a flat form cannot tell a submitter
 * two different things about one refusal; a test pins that they do not.
