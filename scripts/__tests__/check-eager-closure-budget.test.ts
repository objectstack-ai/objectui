/**
 * objectui#7528 — a chunk count in this gate's prose stays pinned to the commit
 * it was measured on, or it is not written.
 *
 * Three sentences here and in the checker described the aggregate as "one number
 * over N chunks" with N written out as a literal. By the time the card was worked
 * that literal, the checker's own frozen `BASELINE.chunks`, and the figure the
 * gate's verdict line printed were three DIFFERENT numbers, with no check red
 * anywhere across the spread, because nothing fails on a stale number in a
 * comment. The count was never load-bearing either: the sentence is rhetorical
 * ("one total over N chunks cannot say WHERE the payload moved"), which is
 * exactly why nothing caught it. Refreshing the literal to today's reading would
 * have turned three numbers into two and restarted the clock; this makes the
 * class fail loudly instead.
 *
 * ⚠️ It also means this docblock may not quote the old literal back: the reader
 * below cannot tell a quotation from a claim, and refusing both is the safe
 * direction for a check on prose accuracy. The numbers live in the card and in
 * the pull request that closed it.
 *
 * The rule is the one the checker's header already states for its motivating
 * table — "that table is the MOTIVATING measurement and stays pinned to
 * `77f846a8b`; it is not the current reading" — generalised and made mechanical.
 * An ANCHORED count is a measurement of a named build and cannot go stale; an
 * unanchored one is a standing claim about the live closure, which moves on most
 * builds. The same distinction is why objectui#7528 declined to file
 * `vite-declared-lazy-views.ts`'s "42.5 KB of headroom": it sits in a paragraph
 * dated to a `b98352a15` measurement and reads as history.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, and each limit is a decision rather than an oversight:
 *
 *   - NUMERALS qualifying a CHUNK noun. "144 modules" and "166 modules" are
 *     module counts inside anchored change records, not claims about the shape
 *     of the closure, and none of them rots when a chunk is added.
 *   - OWN-LINE comments — block comments and `//` lines, the form every
 *     paragraph of prose in these two files is written in.
 *   - The anchor window is a paragraph PLUS the one before it, because the
 *     header writes its lead-in ("Measured on `77f846a8b`:") and its table as
 *     two paragraphs. A sha cannot reach across code: a code line breaks the
 *     paragraph, so a hash in one block never anchors a count in another.
 *
 * The window is a heuristic in one direction and is left that way knowingly: a
 * lead-in paragraph anchors what follows it, so a hash written for one reason can
 * vouch for a count beside it. It errs toward ALLOWING, which is the tolerable
 * side for a check on prose — the intolerable side is a standing claim nobody
 * refuses. The two legs of the reader's own self-test above hold each direction.
 *
 * `.github/workflows/performance-budget.yml` joined this population in
 * objectui#7850 — the same rule, the same reader, no second matcher. Its prose
 * is `#` comments rather than `/**` blocks, so it reaches the reader through
 * `yamlProse` below, which translates the marker and nothing else.
 *
 * Its one obstacle was settled by REWORDING, not by an exemption. The workflow
 * counted chunks once as the OUTCOME of a hazard — a `"sideEffects": false`
 * that is statically coherent while the registrations it governs reach no chunk
 * at all, objectui#6535 — which is structural, has no build that can move it,
 * and which this reader cannot tell from a population count. That sentence now
 * states the outcome without a numeral, so the reader needs no exception to be
 * right about it; the alternative was an exemption entry, and exemption lists
 * are how a pin decays.
 *
 * ⚠️ The workflow's frozen-SIZE prose is a DIFFERENT class and is deliberately
 * OUT of this pin — named here so nobody widens a count pin into a size pin by
 * accident. The 350 KB entry line, the 89 KiB regression and the byte figures
 * measured on `77f846a8b` are sizes, and a pin for them would have to tell a
 * ceiling's value from the several sizes that paragraph legitimately carries,
 * which this test does not do.
 *
 * Only the negative half is asserted. A positive "the prose names the verdict
 * line" pin would fix a wording, and what has to stay true is narrower: that no
 * number is written here which the next build could falsify.

// ── the ceiling note names its constants, and never renders them ─────────────

/**
 * objectui#8964 — the header note that says WHICH constant is which may name
 * its two subjects, and may not render either of them as a size.
 *
 * The note used to do both. It stated the aggregate ceiling and the baseline as
 * MiB literals and then explained, correctly and at length, why the two figures
 * were consistent with each other. A maintainer-authorised re-baseline moved
 * both constants; the prose stayed. For four days and three subsequent edits to
 * that file the note rendered the RETIRED pair, explaining the consistency of
 * two numbers neither of which was in force, and nothing anywhere went red —
 * because nothing fails on a number written in a comment.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is NOT a widening of the chunk-count pin above into a size pin. That
 * trade was weighed there and declined for a reason that still holds: a general
 * size pin would have to tell a ceiling's value from the several sizes this
 * file's prose legitimately carries, and it cannot. This pin does not try. Its
 * population is two named paragraphs which carry no size at all, and its whole
 * claim is that they still carry none. The anchored measurements elsewhere in
 * the header — the re-baseline records, the incident figures — are outside it
 * and stay exactly as they are.
 *
 * ⚠️ Nor may this docblock quote the retired literals back, for the reason the
 * objectui#7528 block gives: the reader cannot tell a quotation from a claim,
 * and refusing both is the safe direction. The numbers live in the card.
 *
 * The region is located by the sentence that opens it and the sentence that
 * closes it, both asserted present and unique, so a rewrite that drops either
 * one turns this red rather than green — an empty scan here would otherwise be
 * indistinguishable from a note that states nothing.

// ── no prose here classifies this check against branch protection ───────────

/**
 * objectui#9155 — eight sentences across this gate's three prose files stated,
 * as a fact, that `Bundle Analysis` belongs to the branch-protection set.
 *
 * The repo's own machine-readable classifier answered the neighbouring question
 * differently: `scripts/dependabot-merge-gate.mjs` lists that check under
 * `OPTIONAL_CONTEXTS`, because this workflow filters at the trigger. And the
 * workflow contradicted ITSELF four lines apart — its job-ceiling comment had
 * measured that the `on:` block subscribes `push` and `pull_request` and no
 * `merge_group`, directly under a sentence that read the other way.
 *
 * ⛔ The fix was NOT to flip the prose to the opposite classification. The
 * branch-protection set is not readable from inside a checkout (AGENTS.md says
 * so), so BOTH readings are claims no reader can re-derive, and swapping one
 * for the other buys one round before the same drift returns. The prose now
 * cites the two things the tree does answer, and this pin is the instrument
 * AGENTS.md #9 asks for in exchange: the claim cannot come back in either
 * direction without going red.
 *
 * ⚠️ The population is COMMENT PROSE and this pin reads it deliberately, with
 * no code/comment split at all. A code-only reader would score the whole of
 * objectui#9155 as a no-op, because every one of the eight sites was a comment.
 *
 * ⚠️ The refused phrase is ASSEMBLED below rather than written out: this file
 * is itself in the population, and a pin that spells its own trigger fails on
 * its own source. The must-hit control is what keeps that assembly honest.
 *
 * ⛔ No count of either classifier table is asserted or written here. That list
 * grows — two correct readings taken a day apart during this card's own triage
 * disagreed — and a size baked into a test is the same defect one level up.
