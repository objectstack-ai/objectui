 * The renderer boundary: consume or declare, never spread (objectui#4492)
 *
 * This renderer — registered TWICE, as `plugin-calendar:object-calendar` and as
 * `view:calendar`, so one implementation serves both keys — used to end in
 * `< ObjectCalendar schema={bound} dataSource={dataSource} {...props} />`, where
 * `props` was everything `SchemaRenderer` hands a registered widget: the node's
 * own authored keys, the contents of its `props` container, the injected runtime
 * props (`events`, `ariaLabel`/`role`, `data-obj-*`, …) and a host's trailing
 * props — an UNBOUNDED set, spread onto a component whose props are a CLOSED
 * list. `ObjectCalendarComponentProps` declares eight callbacks and a `locale`, so an
 * authored value under any of those names landed on the declared prop, and an
 * SDUI author writing JSON can never produce a function.
 *
 * MEASURED on the pre-fix tree (objectui#4492), all three uncaught or fatal:
 *
 *   - `onDateClick: 'NOT-A-FUNCTION'` → clicking an empty day cell throws
 *     `onDateClick is not a function`. `ObjectCalendar` tests `if (onDateClick)`
 *     and a non-empty string is TRUTHY, so the guard hands the string to a call.
 *   - `onNavigate: 'NOT-A-FUNCTION'` → clicking **Next period** throws
 *     `onNavigate is not a function`; `?.` guards nullish, not non-callable.
 *   - `locale: 'en_US'` → `toLocaleDateString('en_US')` throws
 *     `RangeError: Incorrect locale information provided` out of RENDER, taking
 *     the whole calendar to `SchemaErrorBoundary`.
 *
 * The first two are worse than an error boundary: React does not route
 * event-handler errors to `SchemaErrorBoundary`, so they surface as UNCAUGHT
 * window errors while the calendar keeps looking fine and that gesture is dead.
 *
 * The objectui#4425 phase-2 ruling (option 1, whitelist bounded by declaration)
 * applied to this renderer exactly as objectui#4453 applied it to the sibling
 * `calendar-view` renderer next door: **the forward set is exactly
 * {@link ObjectCalendarComponentProps}, every key resolved to the type that prop
 * declares; everything else is dropped.** `rest` below is READ for the declared
 * keys and is never spread — that is the whole of this fix.
 *
 * A deny-list could not close this: the leak is the open tail of author-supplied
 * keys, which no enumeration can finish. This list is finishable because
 * `ObjectCalendarComponentProps` declares it — and dropping the tail costs nothing,
 * because `ObjectCalendar` DESTRUCTURES a closed list and reads no other prop.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

/**
 * The DECLARED host escape hatch: `ObjectCalendar`'s callback surface, forwarded
 * only when the value really is a function.
 *
 * One key, two very different producers arriving through the SAME channel: an
 * SDUI author writing JSON, whose value can never be a function (so it is always
 * one of the crashes above), and a React host, whose passthrough works today and
 * must keep working. This is not hypothetical for this widget — `ListView`
 * builds an `object-calendar` node carrying `onRowClick: navigation.handleClick`
 * (`packages/plugin-list/src/ListView.tsx`, `baseProps`), a real FUNCTION on a
 * real node key. The key name cannot separate the two producers; only the
 * value's TYPE can. So the hatch is DECLARED here, and off-type input gets the
 * one answer every other resolver in this file gives: dropped — the same answer
 * as an absent key. That is the objectui#4435 declared-passthrough pattern, not
 * a lenient consumer coercion (AGENTS.md #0.1).
 *
 * The whole family is listed rather than the two reported keys, because the
 * defect is the family's: every one of these is a prop `ObjectCalendarComponentProps`
 * declares, so listing them narrows what may reach the component and widens
 * nothing.
 *
 * `onEdit` and `onDelete` are declared by `ObjectCalendarComponentProps` but are NOT
 * destructured by the component (`ObjectCalendar.tsx` — the record drawer builds
 * its own edit/delete handlers from `dataSource`), so forwarding them is inert
 * today. They are listed anyway: the hatch is bounded by the DECLARATION, and a
 * key that is declared, inert and silently dropped would be a second, quieter
 * contract than the one this boundary states. Their inertness is a census
 * observation, not a behaviour change — before and after this card, a value
 * under either name does nothing.

/**
 * The authoring surface both `ObjectCalendarRenderer` tags publish, spelled
 * ONCE and spread into both registrations (objectui#8201).
 *
 * ## Why it is shared rather than hand-copied
 *
 * `object-calendar` and `view:calendar` are the SAME renderer, so a hand-copy
 * is the only way the two lists could ever disagree. Sharing removes that
 * failure mode structurally rather than by review attention.
 *
 * ## Why these two keys were added
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s `ComponentPropsMap['object-calendar']` declares nine
 * top-level keys; this list published four. The gap was STRUCTURAL rather than
 * considered — the console registers this block with
 * `ComponentRegistry.registerLazy` and `getConfig` is loaded-only by design, so
 * the block sat outside the console's reverse-parity population entirely until
 * objectui#8176 loaded it. objectui#8201 asked the per-key question.
 *
 * Both keys were measured against a read site that CHANGES BEHAVIOUR, and the
 * two arrive through DIFFERENT channels, which is worth spelling out because
 * the channel is what makes each honoured:
 *
 *   - `defaultView` — read off the SCHEMA (`ObjectCalendar.tsx` seeds its
 *     `view` state from `schema.defaultView`), so the calendar opens on the
 *     authored grid. A narrow viewport downgrades `day` to `month`; the
 *     author's choice is otherwise honoured on first render.
 *   - `locale` — read off the PROPS channel this boundary resolves
 *     (`resolveAuthoredLocale(rest.locale)`), which is where `SchemaRenderer`
 *     delivers a node's own authored keys. It forwards only a tag
 *     `Intl.getCanonicalLocales` accepts, and the forwarded value reaches
 *     `toLocaleDateString` / `toLocaleTimeString` inside the component. Pinned
 *     already by `object-calendar-renderer.propsContract.test.tsx`'s
 *     MUST-NOT-CHANGE row, which authors `locale: 'de-DE'` on the NODE.
 *
 * `defaultView`'s declared members are the spec's own three and nothing else.
 * That is load-bearing: this gate judges an `enum` arm EXACTLY (every declared
 * member must be a value the contract accepts), and `agenda` was RETIRED from
 * this enum (objectui#5784, pinned by `default-view-agenda-retired.test.ts`) —
 * so a fourth member copied from an older doc would be a red arm, not a nicety.
 *
 * ## What declaring them widens, and on what grounds (clause ②)
 *
 * Declaring an input WIDENS the authoring surface, so the grounds are stated:
 * the SPEC already declares both and the RENDERER already honours both — the
 * identical grounds objectui#8186 (`filter`) and objectui#8223 (`sort`) cleared
 * on. Measured with a control on the same `safeParse` call, because "the spec
 * declares it" is the assumption objectui#8172 falsified for `limit`.
 *
 * ## The remaining three keys — objectui#8314, and the list is now COMPLETE
 *
 * `data`, `staticData` and `loading` were the last of the nine, and they close
 * this block's reverse-parity backlog entirely: no `object-calendar` key is
 * spec-declared, renderer-honoured and undiscoverable any more.
 *
 * Same clause ② grounds as `defaultView` / `locale` above, re-measured on
 * @objectstack/spec 17.3.0 rather than inherited: all three parse on one
 * `safeParse` call while a probe key on the SAME call draws
 * `unrecognized_keys`, so this declares what the contract already accepts.
 * Their arms are `z.array(z.unknown())`, `z.array(z.unknown())` and
 * `z.boolean()` — the two array members are UNCONSTRAINED, which is why no
 * `of` is declared (the member contract admits every coarse kind) and why the
 * READ SITE is the whole of the member contract there is, exactly as the
 * `filter` and `sort` entries above record.
 *
 * ⚠️ Each key is honoured at a DIFFERENT sink, and two of the three are read
 * off the PROPS channel rather than off the schema — the distinction that
 * decides where a pin has to observe them:
 *
 *   - `data` — `resolveExternalData(rest.data)` at THIS boundary, forwarded as
 *     the component's `data` prop, where `Array.isArray` turns it into
 *     `hasExternalData`. The rows are drawn as-is and the internal query never
 *     runs.
 *   - `staticData` — read off the SCHEMA, inside `ObjectCalendar`, by the
 *     shared record-source ladder (`resolveRecordSourceConfig`): rung 2, so an
 *     authored `data` wins and `objectName` loses.
 *   - `loading` — `resolveExternalLoading(rest.loading)` at this boundary, and
 *     `ObjectCalendar` applies it only under `hasExternalData`. Slice 1 held it
 *     back on the REASONING that it is inert alone; objectui#8314 MEASURED that
 *     and it held — `loading: true` replaces a `data` calendar with the loading
 *     placeholder and does nothing at all to a `staticData` one — so it is
 *     declared on those terms, with the coupling named in its description.
 *
 * ⛔ THE TRAP A FUTURE PIN MUST NOT FALL INTO, measured by ablation on
 * objectui#8314. An authored `data` reaches this renderer on BOTH carriers —
 * `SchemaRenderer` spreads non-metadata node keys as React props, so the same
 * authored array is `rest.data` here AND `schema.data` inside the component,
 * where the ladder's rung 1 returns it verbatim as a record-source config. A
 * bare array carries no `provider`, so that config matches no fetch branch and
 * NO QUERY IS ISSUED EITHER WAY. "Authoring `data` skips the fetch" is
 * therefore true on a tree where this boundary drops `data` entirely: a pin
 * resting on it cannot fail. The load-bearing claim is that the AUTHORED ROWS
 * ARE DRAWN, and that is what
 * `__tests__/ObjectCalendar.recordSourceMembers-8314.test.tsx` asserts.
 *
 * The declarations are pinned by
 * `__tests__/scalarKeysAreDeclaredAndHonoured-8201.test.ts` and
 * `__tests__/dataKeysAreDeclaredAndHonoured-8314.test.ts`, per tag and per
 * key, so removing one from this list reddens a NAMED row rather than a file.
 * The second file also pins each description's POSITION sentence, because a
 * description that recommends a write the renderer would drop is this gate's
 * own failure mode one layer in.
