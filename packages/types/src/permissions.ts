// RETIRED (objectui#8024, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove, maintainer ruling on
// that card): `PermissionGuardConfig` — the "permission guard configuration
// for UI components" record `{ permission, object?, fallback?, fallbackComponent?,
// redirectPath? }` — is gone, not narrowed. It was a declaration plus two
// barrel re-exports (this package's root barrel and `@object-ui/permissions`'s)
// and nothing else. Measured before removal: nothing in this repo, the example
// apps or the `objectstack` sibling checkout constructed, accepted, annotated
// or read one, and `@objectstack/spec` declares no guard-config shape of its
// own, so there was no upstream contract for it to mirror.
//
// ⭐ The shape the shipped guard reads is `PermissionGuardProps`, declared
// beside the component in `@object-ui/permissions` (`PermissionGuard.tsx`) and
// exported from that package's root. Author a guard against it: the required
// permission is `action` (not `permission`), `object` is required, denied
// content is `fallbackContent` (a React node, not a `fallbackComponent` type
// name), and `fallback` is `'hide' | 'disable' | 'custom'`.
//
// ⛔ `fallback: 'redirect'` and `redirectPath` NEVER EXISTED as a capability.
// They were declared here and honoured nowhere: `'redirect'` was never a
// member of the union `PermissionGuard` switches on, and no code in this
// repository ever read `redirectPath` — no guard ever sent a denied user
// anywhere. Removing them takes away no behaviour. Declaring them again
// without a guard that implements them is the declare-without-enforce shape
// this removal closes.
//
// Removed outright rather than kept as a `?: never` carcass, on this
// package's retire-vs-remove discriminator — cited, not restated: the rule is
// stated on `ChatbotSchema` in `complex.ts`, in the form objectui#7678 amended
// it to (precedent changesets objectui#5941 / #7526). `PermissionGuardConfig`
// is a whole exported type name, so there is no surviving carrier to hang a
// `never` key on and that precondition settles the route by itself. Nor is
// there a silent-strip hazard to guard: this module has never had a `zod/`
// twin, so nothing ever parsed the shape. Same route as
// `MobileResponsiveConfig` / `GestureConfig` (objectui#7519) in `mobile.ts`.
// Pinned in `./__tests__/permission-guard-config-retired-8024.test.ts`.
