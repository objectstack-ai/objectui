 * ADR-0057 #8 — the console AI usage indicator's data hook.
 *
 * Fetches `GET {apiBase}/usage` (the cloud runtime's read-only companion to the
 * token guardrail) and exposes the headroom of the environment's ONE AI quota
 * pool, which the ChatDock header renders as a single ring (objectui#8524). The
 * endpoint speaks a D5-SAFE shape — FRACTIONS of the pool's cap, never a raw
 * token count — so nothing here (or downstream) can leak a token number.
 *
 * Wire shape: `{ pool, breakdown }`. `pool` is the one reading that gates;
 * `breakdown` is an observation-only split of that same pool into app-building
 * vs data Q&A (cloud ADR-0015). The reader is strict: it reads this shape and no
 * other — the retired per-meter `{ meters: { build, dataChat } }` answer parses
 * to `null` — so the next wire change is a failed parse, not a silent second
 * dialect. `breakdown` is optional upstream (cloud#2133 lets the endpoint keep
 * it, it does not require it), so its ABSENCE is a normal reading and never a
 * parse failure.
 *
 * Refetch triggers, cheap and event-driven (no busy polling):
 *   - on mount / apiBase change,
 *   - on the `AI_USAGE_REFRESH_EVENT` the chat engine fires after a turn finishes
 *     or a send is rejected (429) — so the ring moves right after the user's action,
 *   - on tab re-focus (catches usage spent in another tab).
 *
 * Fail-soft: any error (endpoint absent on an old backend, network, non-2xx, an
 * answer that is not the shape above) leaves `usage` null and sets `error`. The
 * indicator treats null as "nothing to show" and renders nothing, so a
 * missing/!deployed endpoint degrades to no widget rather than a broken one.
