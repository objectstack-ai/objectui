/**
 * Every ```ts / ```tsx fenced block inside a JSDoc `@example` on an EXPORTED
 * declaration under `packages/NAME/src/**` must COMPILE, `--strict`, against the
 * packages' BUILT `dist/*.d.ts` — or be DECLARED in the ledger below with a
 * written reason and the diagnostics it currently produces.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-doc-example-types.mjs   (also `pnpm check:doc-examples`)
 * Exit: 0 = every covered example compiles, or fails exactly as its ledger row
 *       says it does; the harness proved itself on its own controls.
 *       1 = THE GATE RAN AND FOUND ERRORS. An example failed and nothing
 *       declared it, an example a row declares now compiles, or a row's
 *       diagnostics no longer match what the example produces.
 *       2 = THE GATE COULD NOT RUN, so nothing printed above is a verdict about
 *       any example: the packages are unbuilt (or typed from source), the walk
 *       collapsed, or one of the harness's own controls failed.
 *
 * This is a SIBLING of `scripts/check-doc-snippet-types.mjs`, not a fork. The
 * scan surface, the extraction and the ledger are this file's; the compiler
 * host, the built-`.d.ts` resolution, the root bound and every control are
 * IMPORTED from that harness and run unmodified, so an `@example` block is
 * judged by exactly the program a documentation fence is judged by. The two
 * gates' exit codes are deliberately the same three, for the reason that file's
 * header gives: "I could not run" and "I ran and found errors" are different
 * facts and must not share a code.
 *
 * ## What this gate answers, and the four things it does NOT
 *
 * It answers exactly one question: **does this shipped `@example` still compile
 * against the published types.** objectui#7974 is the defect that shape has:
 * `useSpecGesture`'s own `@example` passes a scalar `swipe.direction` where the
 * declared type is `SpecSwipeDirection[]`, so a reader who copies the example
 * out of their IDE's hover gets TS2322 — and nothing in this repository had ever
 * compiled it, because the Markdown gate's surface stops at `content/docs`, the
 * per-app docs trees, the package READMEs and the root pages.
 *
 * It does NOT answer:
 *
 *   1. **Whether a BARE `@example` body is correct.** Only FENCED ts/tsx blocks
 *      are compiled. The census below counts the bare ones rather than hiding
 *      them, and the reason they stay out is measured, not assumed — see
 *      "Why bare `@example` bodies are counted and not compiled".
 *   2. **Whether the example is idiomatic, runnable, or true.** A block that
 *      compiles can still teach a call nobody should make. That is review.
 *   3. **Schema-key validity** — the sibling's blind spot 1, unchanged here: a
 *      metadata literal that `safeParse` would reject can still satisfy a
 *      TypeScript annotation.
 *   4. **Code inside template literals.** That population already has an
 *      instrument: `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs --emit-census` (objectui#7864)
 *      walks the same `packages/NAME/src/**` tree, recognises a template that
 *      carries an `import`, substitutes its holes and compiles it through the
 *      same `compileSnippets()`. Adding a second reader of the same population
 *      here would be a second answer to a question that already has one. See
 *      "The template-literal half of objectui#8258" below.
 *
 * ## The population, and why the compiled tier is the fenced blocks
 *
 * Measured on the branch point (objectui#8258's first run), with the funnel this
 * gate re-prints on every run so the number it enforces stays DERIVED rather
 * than asserted:
 *
 *     1418  source files under packages/NAME/src (.ts/.tsx), tooling excluded
 *     2421    ... tooling files excluded by TOOLING_FILE (tests, mocks, stories)
 *      228  `@example` tags found by the AST
 *        0    ... in tooling files
 *       15    ... on a NON-exported declaration
 *      213  `@example` tags on EXPORTED declarations
 *      124    ... carrying a ts/tsx/typescript fence   <- THE COMPILED TIER
 *        1    ... carrying only an unlabelled fence
 *       88    ... BARE, no fence at all
 *
 * ### Why bare `@example` bodies are counted and not compiled
 *
 * Not an optimisation and not a silent skip — a measurement. 67 of the 88 bare
 * bodies parse as TSX, which sounds like a compilable population and is not: the
 * dominant shape is a VALUE illustration on an interface property, and it parses
 * only because a comma-separated list of string literals is a legal expression
 * statement. From `packages/types/src/base.ts`:
 *
 *     Component type identifier. Determines which renderer to use.
 *     `@example` 'input', 'button', 'form', 'grid'
 *
 * Compiling that judges nothing — it is four string literals — while the fenced
 * tier holds the blocks whose authors wrote a module. Feeding the bare tier to a
 * strict program would judge prose on rules its author never opted into, which is
 * the same reason `TS_FENCE_LANGUAGES` in the sibling excludes `js` and `jsx`.
 * The count is printed every run, so the day someone starts fencing them the
 * number moves and this paragraph is re-read.
 *
 * ## The ONE transformation, stated out loud
 *
 * A JSDoc `@example` is read in the IDE beside the declaration it documents, so
 * the documented symbol is in scope for its reader by construction; a fenced
 * block almost never imports it (measured: 8 of 124 import anything at all). The
 * gate therefore prepends ONE line:
 *
 *     import { SYMBOL } from 'SPECIFIER';
 *
 * and only when all three hold, each re-checked per run:
 *
 *   - the block's text references SYMBOL;
 *   - the block does not already import SYMBOL itself;
 *   - some probed SPECIFIER really exports SYMBOL — compiled in the same
 *     program, never assumed. TWO candidates are probed, in this order, and the
 *     first one that imports wins:
 *
 *       1. the package's ROOT specifier, e.g. `@object-ui/types`;
 *       2. the BUILT declaration of the symbol's OWN source file — the `dist`
 *          twin of `packages/NAME/src/a/b.ts`, offered only when that twin is
 *          on disk.
 *
 * The count reached by each candidate is printed every run, so both stay derived.
 *
 * ### Why candidate 2 exists, and why it widens nothing (objectui#8743)
 *
 * The justification above is SCOPE, not publication. Candidate 1 alone models
 * scope as "importable from the package's public entry", which is a publication
 * test, and it answers NO for every symbol a package exports to its own modules
 * and to nothing else. Such a block is then judged WITHOUT the import it needs,
 * so any example that spells its own symbol's name is TS2304 — not because the
 * example is wrong, but because this file could not name the symbol.
 *
 * `stripImportedDefaults` landed exactly there and reddened `main`. It is
 * deliberately package-internal — objectui#8317's design is that the strip
 * happens at the import boundary, not that consumers call it — so with candidate
 * 1 as the only route the remaining two are: EXPORT it, widening a published
 * surface (and moving `@object-ui/types`' public API) for a docs gate; or write
 * a ledger row, converting a checked example into an unchecked one. Both are
 * worse than the defect. Candidate 2 is the third route: the declaring module IS
 * an internal symbol's scope, and its built `.d.ts` is the same artifact tier
 * candidate 1 resolves to. Nothing is exported, nothing new is published, and
 * the example stays COMPILED.
 *
 * ⛔ Candidate 2 is not a licence to reference anything: it names the symbol the
 * block documents and nothing else, which is the same one-line bound candidate 1
 * has always had. It is not the `declare var NAME: any` pass refused below —
 * the types come from the real built declaration, so the call is judged against
 * the shipped signature.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is still PROBED, never assumed, and a bundling build has no twin to
 * probe: `tsup`/rolldown emit one `dist/index.d.ts` and no per-file declaration,
 * so the candidate is absent and the conservative answer stands. That is why the
 * printed list remains "symbols this gate did not inject", NOT a list of defects.
 *
 * ⚠️ Neither candidate guesses a SUBPATH. A symbol published only under one
 * (`@object-ui/types/zod`) is not reached by candidate 1 and does not need to
 * be — those blocks import themselves, which is what a reader copying them does,
 * and `alreadyImported` then withholds the prelude anyway.
 *
 * Prepended, not appended, because an `import` must precede the code that uses
 * it; the printed line numbers therefore carry an offset, which `formatDiagnostic`
 * is given as the block's fence line. Without this transformation the run is
 * unreadable rather than strict: 303 of 348 diagnostics were TS2304 naming the
 * documented symbol itself, and objectui#7974's real TS2322 was MASKED behind
 * `Cannot find name 'useSpecGesture'`. That is the whole argument for the line —
 * it does not make failures go away, it makes the surviving ones be about the
 * documented API.
 *
 * ⛔ What was priced and REFUSED: a second pass declaring every remaining free
 * name as `declare var NAME: any`. It shrinks the ledger from 90 rows to 32 and
 * is the wrong trade in every direction. It INVENTS diagnostics (measured: 6
 * TS2749 "refers to a value, but is being used as a type" and 2 TS2451
 * redeclarations that exist only because of the injected declarations), it makes
 * every downstream check on those names vacuous, and a green bought with `any`
 * teaches the next author that referencing an undeclared name is how you stop the
 * gate looking — the consumer-side tolerance AGENTS.md commandment #0.1 bans, one
 * level up. A 90-row ledger that says a true thing beats a 32-row ledger that
 * launders 58 rows through `any`.
 *
 * ## The ledger, and what makes it shrink-only
 *
 * `UNGATED_EXAMPLES` is keyed by `path symbol #ordinal` and each row carries the
 * diagnostic CODES the example currently produces, a written reason, and the card
 * that owns it. Four verdicts, and only the first is silent:
 *
 *   block fails + row's codes match      -> declared debt, exempt
 *   block fails + no row                 -> RED. A new example must compile.
 *   block COMPILES + row                 -> RED, stale. The debt was paid; the
 *                                           row outlived it and must be deleted.
 *   block fails + row's codes DIFFER     -> RED. The failure changed underneath
 *                                           the declaration; re-derive the row.
 *   row naming a block that is gone      -> RED, stale.
 *
 * The third verdict is what makes the ledger shrink-only, and it is the same pin
 * `UNGATED_DOCS` carries in the sibling: a debt that can be declared once and
 * never re-examined is not a ledger, it is a mute button. The fourth is this
 * gate's addition — a row that says "fails with TS2304" must not go on covering
 * the block after the failure became TS2322.
 *
 * ⚠️ Recording codes makes a row sensitive to the TypeScript version, on purpose.
 * An upgrade that renumbers or splits a diagnostic reddens the rows it moved,
 * with "re-derive" printed beside them. That is a loud, correct signal about a
 * ledger whose rows are claims about a compiler; the alternative — a row that
 * covers whatever the block does today — is the mute button again.
 *
 * ### The first run: 90 of 124, and why it lands as a ledger rather than a clean
 *
 * 119 blocks reached the semantic phase (5 do not parse), 34 compile, 85 fail.
 * The failures are overwhelmingly ONE shape: a usage fragment that references
 * ambient names it never declares (`manager`, `evaluator`, `navigate`, `App`).
 * Those are not defects in the documented API and repairing them is editorial
 * work on 66 separate files — which is precisely what a declared, shrink-only
 * ledger is for, and precisely how objectui#5174 burned `UNGATED_DOCS` down to
 * the empty object it is today. Each row names what the example references, so
 * the row goes stale the moment the example is made self-contained.
 *
 * ⚠️ objectui#7974 is OPEN, and its row is the reason this gate ships with a
 * ledger rather than a green: `packages/mobile/src/useSpecGesture.ts` still
 * carries the scalar `direction` on `main`, its card is on another lane's queue
 * (`domain:ui`, `pm:queue`), and this gate may not fix it. The row records
 * TS2322 by number. When that lane repairs the example the row goes STALE and
 * reddens on THEIR pull request, which is the hand-off working as designed, not
 * a defect in it.
 *
 * ## The template-literal half of objectui#8258
 *
 * The card asks this gate to "decide per case whether to extract (a fenced marker
 * inside the literal) or to exempt with a reason". The decision, measured:
 * **no new rule here, and the exemption has a reason that is not "too hard".**
 *
 *   - The extraction the card imagines ALREADY EXISTS and already runs on this
 *     exact tree. `--emit-census` reports 20 recognised templates across
 *     `packages/cli`, `packages/create-plugin` and `packages/vscode-extension`,
 *     compiled through the same `compileSnippets()`. Building a second extractor
 *     here would put two readers on one population, which is how the two answers
 *     start disagreeing.
 *   - objectui#7977 is CLOSED (by objectui#8112, which corrected the prose).
 *   - objectui#7976's residue is NOT a template-parsing problem. It is
 *     `packages/vscode-extension/DESIGN.md` holding a hand-copied MIRROR of a
 *     template's text. Compiling the template — which `--emit-census` already
 *     does, at 0 diagnostics — says nothing about whether the mirror still
 *     matches it. That card needs an equality pin between two texts, which is a
 *     different instrument from a type-checker and belongs on that card.
 *
 * @type {never}
