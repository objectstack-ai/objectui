 *
 * `scripts/js-comment-mask.mjs` answers that question for every source-scanning
 * gate in this tree, and its `--self-test` pins the SHAPES: sources someone
 * wrote down, each with a known right answer. This is the other instrument, and
 * the two do not subsume each other:
 *
 *   the self-test pins shapes someone thought of, the sweep finds shapes the
 *   tree actually contains, and neither substitutes for the other.
 *
 * ## Ported from objectstack, and where this copy diverges
 *
 * Origin: `scripts/check-comment-mask-corpus.mjs` in objectstack-ai/objectstack,
 * blob `dd50cb13ae277ac29439f9d6d2c657e01243057a` (read from `origin/main`,
 * 2026-09-07). `js-comment-mask.mjs`'s header named that script and said it was
 * NOT ported here and that nothing in this repository ran it; that paragraph is
 * updated by the same change that added this file.
 *
 * ⛔ This is NOT a verbatim copy. The four divergences below are structural --
 * a different oracle import, a different prerequisite helper, a different
 * skip-list and a different failure posture. No gate compares it with upstream
 * (this repository's port pin and its parity gate were retired by
 * objectui#10208), so drift from upstream is found by hand.
 *
 *   1. THE ORACLE IS REACHED THROUGH `typescript-eslint`, NOT
 *      `@typescript-eslint/parser`. Upstream imports the parser package
 *      directly, which is a root devDependency THERE. Here it is not declared at
 *      the root at all -- only pulled in transitively by `typescript-eslint`
 *      (root devDependency `^8.67.0`) -- and pnpm's isolated `node_modules` means
 *      a direct import does not even resolve from the repo root (measured:
 *      `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`). `typescript-eslint` re-exports that same package
 *      at that same version as `parser`, so this port reads the oracle from the
 *      declaration this repository already has rather than adding a second one
 *      for a module that is already installed. The re-export exposes
 *      `parseForESLint` rather than `parse`; `parseForESLint(source, options).ast`
 *      is the same AST, and `adaptParse` below is the whole adaptation.
 *
 *   2. THE PREREQUISITE HELPER IS INLINED, NOT PORTED. Upstream calls
 *      `requireDependency` from its `scripts/import-prerequisite.mjs` -- 1,448
 *      lines, none of the rest of which this tree has any caller for. The one
 *      behaviour that matters here is that an uninstalled tree gets a NAMED
 *      prerequisite and a distinct exit code instead of a raw
 *      `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` stack and the exit 1 a real finding uses. That is
 *      `loadParser` below, and it is roughly fifteen lines. Inlining the one
 *      function was the smaller of the two, by two orders of magnitude.
 *
 *   3. THE SKIP LIST IS THIS TREE'S. Upstream skips `.cache` because its console
 *      build materialises a whole objectui checkout there; this repository has no
 *      `.cache` and no such step, so carrying that entry would be inherited
 *      folklore. What this tree does have is its own set of generated and
 *      gitignored directories, and `SKIPPED_DIRECTORIES` names them.
 *
 *   4. THE POSTURE IS REPORT-WITH-A-CEILING, NOT FAIL-ON-ANY-DISAGREEMENT --
 *      see the next section, which is the reason this card exists.
 *
 * ## The posture, and why it is not upstream's
 *
 * Upstream fails on ANY disagreement and carries no allowance for known
 * residue, because its tree sweeps clean. THIS tree does not: objectui#7882 is
 * an OPEN, measured defect in `js-comment-mask.mjs`, pinned deliberately as
 * `KNOWN LIMITS` in `scripts/__tests__/js-comment-mask-jsx-6891.test.ts`, and
 * the maintainer's ruling on that card is that this sweep exists to MEASURE the
 * residue, not to turn the tree red over a defect that is already pinned and
 * already decided about. Landing upstream's posture unchanged would have made a
 * green tree red on day one for a shape a card is deliberately holding open.
 *
 * So the verdict is split by DIRECTION, because the two directions are not the
 * same defect and this tree's residue sits entirely in one of them:
 *
 *   FABRICATES  the parser says comment, the mask says code. Every gate
 *               downstream then reads genuinely commented-out text as live code
 *               and manufactures findings out of prose. `js-comment-mask.mjs`'s
 *               header calls this direction worse than no verifier at all.
 *               Measured over this tree: ZERO bytes, in zero files. It is clean,
 *               so it is asserted -- any fabricated byte is FATAL. Holding a
 *               direction that is already at zero costs this tree nothing today
 *               and is the whole of what a regression here would look like.
 *
 *   OVER-MASKS  the mask says comment, the parser says code. The gate goes blind
 *               over real code instead -- quieter, and the direction the module's
 *               header calls the better one to fail in. This is where objectui#7882's
 *               residue lands, so it is REPORTED against a declared ceiling
 *               rather than asserted at zero.
 *
 * ⛔ The ceiling is a CEILING, not an equality: ordinary edits to the file
 * holding the residue must not red this gate, and only getting WORSE may. It is
 * also not an allowlist that grows -- a breach is a new place where a gate reads
 * live code as prose, and the remedy is to look at the file, not to raise the
 * number.
 *
 * ## The measurement this port was written to take (objectui#7882)
 *
 * Run on `b6f821a8b`, this tree, 2026-09-07 -- the reading the card asked for:
 *
 *   files swept                                   4,418
 *   unparseable                                       0
 *   files disagreeing with the parser                 1
 *   FABRICATES bytes                                  0
 *   OVER-MASKS bytes                              1,517
 *   wall clock                                    ~33 s
 *
 * The corpus is 4,418 and not 4,422 because `SKIPPED_DIRECTORIES` excludes
 * `apps/site/.source`, whose four generated files this walk would otherwise
 * judge; a first pass carrying upstream's skip list swept them and found them
 * clean, so the exclusion changes the count and not the reading.
 *
 * The single disagreement is `apps/console/src/pages/DocsIndex.tsx`, and it is
 * objectui#7882's "slash in JSX text" half reaching its worst case. The JSX text
 * `src/docs/*.md` puts a `/` immediately before a `*`, so the scanner opens a
 * phantom BLOCK COMMENT -- not the phantom regex the card leads with -- and
 * because no STAR SLASH terminator follows anywhere in the file (spelled in
 * words on purpose -- writing that pair literally here would end THIS comment,
 * which is the same class of hazard one level up), the phantom runs from line 63 to
 * the end of the file. 1,517 bytes, 37 lines of live JSX, handed to every gate
 * that masks this file as though they were prose.
 *
 * ⚠️ That is bigger than the card's headline number, and it is a DIFFERENT
 * measurement rather than a correction of it. The card's "145 bytes across 28
 * files" is a diff of the LITERAL flag arrays between today's masker and the
 * pre-objectui#6891 one; this sweep diffs the COMMENT flag array against a
 * parser. Both were re-derived on `b6f821a8b`: the card's number reproduces
 * exactly (145 bytes, 28 files, and 0 comment bytes changed between the two
 * maskers, matching that header's claim too). The two numbers are about
 * different arrays and neither supersedes the other.
 *
 * ⚠️ Which gates' verdicts it can move, measured rather than reasoned: of the
 * seven gates in `scripts/` that import this masker, exactly two ever open that
 * file (`check-vi-mock-inherit`, `check-vi-mock-specifiers`; the other five
 * never read it, so no verdict of theirs can move). Both were run against the
 * tree as it is and against a copy in which the phantom is closed by a
 * one-character edit to the JSX text. Both exit 0 either way, with byte-identical
 * output. So as of this commit NO gate's verdict moves -- which is a reading with
 * a shelf life, not a property, and re-taking it is what this script is for.
 *
 * ## Unparseable is fatal, never skipped
 *
 * A file a gate could not read scores as a file with nothing to report, so a
 * file the oracle cannot parse is reported and is fatal. The one accommodation
 * is spelling, not silence: JSX is legal in any JS-family extension, so a
 * `.js`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`/`.jsx` source that fails under the extension's default JSX
 * setting is retried with the other one before it is called unparseable.
 * `.ts`/`.mts`/`.cts` are not retried -- TypeScript forbids JSX there, and
 * `(x) => x` written with a leading type parameter needs JSX off to parse at all.
 *
 * ## The one reconciliation
 *
 * A `#!` line is a comment to node, and `scanSource` flags it as one. The parser
 * does not report it in `comments` at all. Without this reconciliation the sweep
 * would open with one bogus disagreement per shebang file, so the oracle adds
 * the shebang line back explicitly, here, where a reader can see the claim and
 * check it. That is the ONLY reconciliation; every other byte of disagreement is
 * a real disagreement about what a comment is.
 *
 * ## Why the corpus has a floor
 *
 * "0 disagreements" over an empty corpus is byte-identical to "0 disagreements"
 * over a clean one, and the second is the whole point of the run. So a corpus
 * smaller than `CORPUS_FLOOR` is a REFUSAL (exit 3), not a pass. The floor is a
 * smoke detector for a walk that found nothing -- deliberately far below the
 * ~4,400 files this tree holds, because a ratchet on the count would be a number
 * to bump forever and would say nothing about coverage. Coverage is asserted by
 * the self-test instead: it proves, on every single run, that this comparator
 * can still REPORT a disagreement.
 *
 * ## The positive control -- how to prove the sweep can fail
 *
 * A green sweep is worth exactly as much as its ability to go red, so
 * `--masker PATH` points the comparison at a different implementation of
 * `scanSource`. A masker is just a module exporting `scanSource(source)`, so the
 * control can live anywhere:
 *
 *   printf 'export function scanSource(s){return {comment:new Uint8Array(s.length)};}\n' \
 *     > "$TMPDIR/blind-mask.mjs"
 *   node scripts/check-comment-mask-corpus.mjs --masker "$TMPDIR/blind-mask.mjs"
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-07 on this tree: 4,370 of 4,418 files disagree, 21,602,924
 * fabricated bytes, exit 1. A nonzero exit is the EXPECTED outcome of a control
 * run; the gate's contract is the default mode.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE OBVIOUS CONTROL DOES NOT WORK HERE, and the reason is a finding rather
 * than a caveat. Upstream's recipe re-derives its own historical defect by
 * pointing `--masker` at the pre-fix masker. The analogous move here -- extract
 * `js-comment-mask.mjs` and delete objectui#6891's one-token `<` rule -- was
 * measured, and it produces a reading IDENTICAL to the fixed masker's: 1 file,
 * 0 fabricated, 1,517 over-masked, exit 0. That is not the control
 * malfunctioning. objectui#6891's phantom is opened through the LITERAL flag,
 * and a diff of the two maskers over this whole tree moves 145 literal bytes in
 * 28 files while moving exactly ZERO comment bytes -- so a comment-array
 * comparator is blind to it BY CONSTRUCTION, everywhere, not just here.
 *
 * ⇒ The consequence worth carrying: this sweep measures the COMMENT direction
 * only. It is the right instrument for "does a gate read prose as code", and it
 * is NOT an instrument for the literal-flag half of objectui#7882. Anyone
 * reading a green run as coverage of that half is reading it wrong.
