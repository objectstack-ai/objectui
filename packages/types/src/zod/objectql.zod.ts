/**
 * ⭐ THE IMPORT BOUNDARY (objectui#8317, decision batch #90, 2026-09-08).
 *
 * **This mirror authors no default, imported subschemas included.** Batch #69
 * (objectui#7735) ruled that a validator validates and does not write values
 * into an author's document; batch #90 ruled that this holds for EVERY key
 * `safeValidateSchema` answers, not only the sites this repository wrote. So a
 * schema arriving from `@objectstack/spec` crosses into a mirror shape only
 * through `stripImportedDefaults`, which removes each reachable `ZodDefault`
 * with `.removeDefault()` and keeps the key omissible. Keys, types, checks and
 * the accept set are untouched, and a subtree carrying no default comes back
 * reference-equal — so this is a no-op the day the spec adopts the same
 * principle.
 *
 * ⛔ Spelled at every crossing rather than once per file, deliberately: a local
 * `const Spec… = stripImportedDefaults(…)` would put the spec's provenance one
 * hop away from every declaration that reads it, and `check:spec-symbols`
 * (rule 1) reads exactly one hop — a mirror export under a spec-owned name has
 * to show the spec binding in its OWN initializer. The verbosity is the
 * provenance.
 *
 * ⚠️ A read that is NOT a crossing stays unwrapped and is declared as such: a
 * value VOCABULARY (`./views.zod.ts`'s `SpecListViewTypeEnum` and
 * `./objectql.zod.ts`'s `ViewKindEnum`, which unwrap the spec's own
 * `.default('grid')` to reach its enum) and a TYPE position — neither puts a
 * default into a parsed document. `../__tests__/imported-defaults-8317.test.ts`
 * re-derives that exception list from the source rather than trusting this
 * paragraph, and fails if an entry stops matching a real read.

 * and the strict five-key object. `ListViewSchema` below binds that union by reference

 * Peeled rather than restated on purpose: a local copy of the five keys is a third

 * `ListViewExportOptions` docblock already records for the TypeScript face). Every
 * member here is the spec's own schema object, so `'pdf'` and a sixth key stay refused
 * with the spec's own messages and a spec-side change moves this member with it.
 *
 * The TYPE is derived by the same two steps at the TYPE level (`unwrap` then the arm with a
 * `shape`), so the authoring face keeps the spec's per-member types — a `z.ZodRawShape`
 * annotation here would erase them and collapse `z.input` of every member to `unknown`,
 * which the mirror-parity drift ledger reports as `exportOptions` NARROWER than declared.
 *
 * THROWS at module load if the spec stops exposing an object arm. That is the intended
 * failure: the alternative is a member that silently stops being the spec's, which is

 * too — the slot was `ObjectGridSchema` minus `type` and `objectName` — so a

 *
 * ⛔ A tombstone, not an `.omit()`: `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`, so an

 * nine-for-ten by objectui#7779 under the maintainer's ruling B (2026-09-06:
 * liveness first, then mirror-or-retire per key). Every reading below was taken
 * on the `object-view` NODE renderer, `packages/plugin-view/src/ObjectView.tsx`
 * (registered by `plugin-view/src/index.tsx`), with `schema.objectName` /
 * `schema.layout` as the positive controls of the same `schema.KEY` query:
 *
 *   - `navigation`, `searchableFields`, `filterableFields` — the spec models
 *     all three on `ListViewSchema` (`@objectstack/spec/ui`), so they are the
 *     spec's own slots BY REFERENCE (`SpecListViewSchema.shape.*`), never a
 *     local restatement: the declaration already imports the spec's
 *     `NavigationConfig` for `ViewNavigationConfig`, and a literal restating it
 *     is the drift this repo keeps paying for (objectui#4588). The pin asserts
 *     identity against the spec schema, so a spec-side change moves them.
 *   - `allowCreateView`, `viewActions` — READ: the renderer forwards both
 *     verbatim into the `view-switcher` node it composes
 *     (`allowCreateView: schema.allowCreateView`, `viewActions: schema.viewActions`,
 *     then `ViewSwitcher.tsx` reads `schema.allowCreateView` / `schema.viewActions`),
 *     so they are that sibling mirror's slots by reference
 *     (`ViewSwitcherSchema.shape.*`, `./views.zod.ts`) — one shape, two nodes.
 *   - `defaultViewType` (READ: `schema.defaultViewType || 'grid'`),
 *     `defaultListView` (READ: `namedListViews?.[schema.defaultListView]`),
 *     `showViewSwitcher` (READ: `schema.showViewSwitcher === true`) — local
 *     literals matching the declaration. `defaultViewType` is the declaration's
 *     SEVEN-value union on purpose, not the spec's view-kind enum: `chart` and
 *     `tree` are host-composition-only on this node (objectui#5321) and the
 *     `NamedListView.type` twin spells the same seven.
 *   - `viewTabBar` — RETIRED (`retirementTombstone()` below; `?: never` on the
 *     TS face). ZERO reads of the key on the node: the tab-bar UX config
 *     (`ViewTabBarConfig`, still exported) is the `config` PROP of the
 *     `ViewTabBar` component, composed by the host (`@object-ui/app-shell`),
 *     and `plugin-view`'s own `ObjectView` never renders that bar (ADR-0053:
 *     the host owns the switcher). The 2026-07 audit
 *     (`docs/audits/2026-07-objectview-detailview-schema.md`) had already
 *     measured it dead since introduction.
 *   - `listViews` — MIRRORED BY REFERENCE (objectui#7928): the spec's own
 *     `ViewSchema.shape.listViews`, a record of the STRICT
 *     `ObjectListViewSchema`. It was the tenth key, left in the parity ledger
 *     on ruling B's fallback clause because neither value type could be
 *     mirrored without a loss; the maintainer's ruling A (objectui#7928,
 *     comment 5565628927, 「同意」) chose the spec value, staged behind two
 *     cards that removed both losses first: objectui#8254 made the renderer
 *     honour a spec-shaped named view, and objectui#8255 made every document
 *     teach one. ⇒ a named view now needs `columns`, takes `filter` as
 *     `{ field, operator, value }` rules, and is refused `unrecognized_keys`
 *     for any key the protocol does not declare there.
 *
 *     ⚠️ `options` — the one key the renderer still read that the protocol
 *     does not declare on this shape — is REFUSED with the rest (director
 *     ruling, objectui#7928 comment 5856694523, Q1 A). The legacy per-kind bag
 *     stays legal where the protocol declares it, a STORED list overlay
 *     (objectstack#20051), and is folded onto the top-level kind block at the
 *     one door that relays a stored body into this record,
 *     `@object-ui/app-shell`'s `ViewPreview`. `plugin-view` no longer reads
 *     `options` off a named view. ⛔ Never re-admit it here: the canonical
 *     `KIND` block is the only spelling this surface teaches.

 * User Filters — field-level filter definition, DERIVED from the spec's

 *
 * This was a hand-written copy under the spec's own export name — the fork
 * class `check:spec-symbols` exists to stop, and the reason the name sat in
 * that gate's ledger. `field`, `type`, `showCount` and `defaultValues` now
 * flow in from `@objectstack/spec/ui` by reference, so the day the protocol
 * grows a key or a control type this mirror tracks it instead of drifting.
 *
 * Measured against the RESOLVED pin, `@objectstack/spec@17.4.0` — byte-identical
 * is a statement about a version, not a property: the two shapes already agreed
 * on all four of those members, the `type` enum included (the same five control
 * types). So the derivation is not a change of behaviour, it is the same shape
 * with provenance.
 *
 * TWO divergences are kept, each confined to the member that carries it:
 *
 *   1. `label` stays a plain string. The spec widened it to an i18n union
 *      (`string | I18nLabel`), and this key is rendered as a React CHILD by
 *      `@object-ui/plugin-list`'s `UserFilters` — the filter badge reads
 *      `f.label || f.field` straight into JSX. A record arriving there is not
 *      a label in another language, it is "Objects are not valid as a React
 *      child". Localisation on this surface goes through that component's own
 *      resolver (`i18n.fieldLabel`), not through an authored record.
 *   2. `options[]` keeps this package's {@link UserFilterOptionSchema}, for the
 *      same reason on its own `label` (`opt.label` is rendered the same way).
 *
 * `.strip()` restores this lane's posture. The spec's shape is `.strict()`, and
 * inheriting that here would turn a key an author writes today into a 422
 * instead of a silent strip — a protocol decision about the userFilters
 * surface, not a side effect a derivation may make on its own. Left as it was,
 * deliberately: see the note on {@link UserFiltersSchema}.

 * ⚠️ A DECLARED DIALECT of the spec's `UserFiltersSchema`, not a copy of it, and

 * it excuses are measured against `@objectstack/spec@17.4.0` and are:
 *
 *   1. `element` is REQUIRED here and admits only `dropdown | tabs`. The spec
 *      defaults it to `dropdown` and keeps `toggle` in ITS enum so shipped
 *      configs keep rendering (ADR-0047 3.4a); ADR-0053 makes `toggle`
 *      unauthorable on this side — see the key's own note below.
 *   2. `tabs` carries THIS package's legacy preset dialect. The spec's slot is
 *      `ViewTabSchema`, which is `.strict()`, requires `name`, and therefore
 *      rejects the `{ id, filters, default }` documents this schema still
 *      accepts and `normalizeTabPresets` (`@object-ui/plugin-list`) still
 *      normalises at runtime. Binding the spec's slot would 422 metadata that
 *      renders today.
 *   3. The shape STRIPS unknown keys where the spec's is `.strict()`. Closing
 *      it is a protocol decision about this surface — the spec's own
 *      `UserFiltersSchema` header records what closing a shape costs when a key
 *      an author was right to write is not declared — and is deliberately not
 *      taken as a side effect of a burn-down.
 *

// trade-off the spec-field import on `ListViewSchema` makes.
//
// `gantt` needs no local schema at all: the spec config already covers every field
// the renderer reads, so it flows in with the rest of the imported spec fields.
// It used to cover them by being `.passthrough()` for renderer-ahead knobs;
// objectstack#15469 closed that window and DECLARED the ten it was carrying, so

// stripping them here would silently disable a shipped capability. ⚠️ It is NOT
// kept "for the same reason the spec puts it on

// because this object ends `.passthrough()`, an undeclared key is not
// dropped, it is KEPT. That is the whole defect: the surviving key rode the
// bag into `ListView`'s kanban branch, whose `...restKanban` spread lands
// AFTER its own `groupBy: laneField`, so an authored `kanban.groupBy`
// OVERRODE the lane the branch had just resolved from `groupByField`.
// Measured on the card's distinguishing fixture, not reasoned:
// `options.kanban = { groupBy: 'LANE_FROM_STRAY_GROUPBY' }` against
// `kanban = { groupByField: 'LANE_FROM_CANONICAL' }` produced
// `node.groupBy === 'LANE_FROM_STRAY_GROUPBY'`.
//
// ⛔ HONOURING IT AS A DECLARED ALIAS IS NOT AVAILABLE. `@objectstack/spec`'s
// `KanbanConfigSchema` is a `strictObject` of exactly
// `columns` / `groupByField` / `summarizeField` and refuses `groupBy` BY NAME.
// Re-measured at implementation time on the version this tree pins
// (17.4.0 — the card measured 17.3.0), with BOTH controls firing: a lit
// control (`zzzBogusKey` alongside a valid `groupByField`) draws
// `unrecognized_keys` naming the bogus key, and a dark control
// (`groupByField` alone) draws none. Upstream knows the SIBLING alias by name
// — probing `groupField` answers "Did you mean `groupField` → `groupByField`?"
// — and knows nothing at all about `groupBy`, which it refuses as a plain
// unrecognized key. Legalising it is a spec change on its own objectstack
// card, ⛔ never a renderer-side widening (AGENTS.md #0.1).
//
// ⇒ the key is DECLARED and unwritable, so it is refused BY NAME instead of
// riding the passthrough in silence, and this mirror stops being more
// permissive than the protocol it mirrors. The lead sentence is the one the
// spec's own `strictObject({ aliases })` answers with (surface noun quoted
// verbatim from the measurement above), so an author meets ONE remedy on both
// faces. `z.input` is `undefined`, so the inferred TypeScript face carries
// `groupBy?: never` and `tsc` refuses it at the authoring site too.
//
// ⛔ NOT A FOLD onto `groupByField`. A fold is only honest where the canonical
// key is the READER's first limb; here the reader's first limb IS canonical
// (`groupByField || groupField || detectStatusField(...)`), so folding the
// alias in would re-create the very override this refusal closes.
// ⛔ NOT the `groupField` / `cardFields` treatment above either: those two are
// deprecated aliases the SPEC also models under its canonical names and
// `normalize-list-view.ts` folds forward; `groupBy` is modelled nowhere and
// folds nowhere.

 * The legacy `options` bag is `z.record(z.string(), z.any())` and can declare no
 * member at all, so it takes the SAME guidance as a check (`custom` at
 * `options.kanban.groupBy`) — see `ListViewSchema.options` below.
 *
 * The second route is a named view on an `object-view` document, whose
 * `listViews` is the protocol's strict record by reference (objectui#7928), so
 * nothing `ListViewSchema` declares reaches it, and it has ONE nesting: the
 * record refuses a named view's `options` bag whole (`unrecognized_keys` naming
 * `options`), and `generateViewSchema` no longer reads that bag. The `kanban`
 * block there is refused by the protocol alone (`unrecognized_keys` at
 * `listViews.KEY.kanban`, naming `groupBy`): objectui#10321's pointer on that
 * door was retired by objectui#11073, because the protocol's refusal is terminal
 * since `@objectstack/spec` 17.5.0 and the pointer could no longer run.
 *
 * ⚠️ Covering the legacy nesting is not optional politeness: the retired
 * producer (`app-shell`'s `kanbanViewOptions`, objectui#8213) wrote into
 * `options.kanban`, so that is where the stored views this ruling is ABOUT carry
 * the key. Refusing only the declared nesting would leave exactly that
 * population re-grouped in silence — option A, which the ruling did not take.
 *
 * ⛔ Every channel takes ONE string, read off this arm's own `.description`,

 * THE TWO PRE-#2231 CALENDAR DATE ALIASES — DECLARED REFUSALS, BOTH FACES
 * (objectui#8355, director-seat ruling of 2026-09-16, class-1 self-adjudication:
 * "retire the aliases at both faces, now").
 *
 * `dateField` and `endField` are legacy objectui spellings of the calendar date
 * axis the protocol spells `startDateField` / `endDateField`. Neither was ever a
 * MEMBER of a calendar shape here: they rode `.passthrough()` on the two blocks
 * below and `BaseSchema`'s own `.passthrough()` on the node, so an authored
 * value was KEPT unexamined, flattened onto the generated `object-calendar` node
 * by `ListView`'s calendar branch, and read by `ObjectCalendar`'s alias ladder.
 *
 * THE REFUSAL IS THE HALF THAT MAKES THE LADDER REMOVABLE, and the ruling says
 * so in as many words. An earlier attempt (recorded on objectui#8651) removed
 * the ladder while the producer kept spreading the alias, so the same documents
 * stopped drawing and nothing said why — they fell through to `ObjectCalendar`'s
 * generic "Calendar configuration required" screen, which names the canonical
 * keys and says nothing about the key the author actually wrote. The tombstone
 * is what turns that silence into a by-name refusal at the authoring door.
 * ⛔ Do not remove one half without the other.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CANONICAL TARGET IS objectui's, AND UPSTREAM ANSWERS DIFFERENTLY — but
 * ⛔ NOT BECAUSE IT HOLDS A CONTRARY ALIAS ENTRY. This paragraph said "upstream's
 * alias table points this spelling at the END of the event" and that was WRONG
 * about the protocol; the corrected mechanism, re-derived by RUNNING
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.4.0 (the version in the lockfile then) rather than
 * reading it — RE-RUN on 17.5.0 (objectui#11073), whose answer moved, as the
 * last bullet says, and RE-RUN again on the installed 17.6.0 (objectui#11438),
 * which answers every bullet below as 17.5.0 did:
 *
 *   - `CalendarConfigSchema`'s `strictObject` options carry `surface` and
 *     `history` and NOTHING ELSE. There is no `aliases` entry, so upstream holds
 *     no opinion at all about either spelling. ⭐ Lit control that the option
 *     exists and is simply unused here: `GanttQuickFilterSchema`'s nested option
 *     object, in that same generated module, DOES pass
 *     `aliases: { text: 'label', title: 'label', … }`.
 *   - the hint an author sees comes from `findClosestMatches` — a Levenshtein
 *     near-miss suggester the refusal formatter falls back to, budgeted
 *     `max(2, floor(key.length / 3))`. MEASURED against the four known keys:
 *     `dateField` (length 9, budget 3) resolves to `endDateField`, which is 3
 *     edits away, while `startDateField` is 5 and therefore out of budget;
 *     `endField` (length 8, budget 2) reaches nothing, which is why it draws no
 *     hint — and neither does a nonsense control key. ⭐ Positive control that
 *     the suggester is alive and correct for what it is for: a genuine one-char
 *     typo of the canonical key resolves to `startDateField`.
 *   - ON 17.5.0 THAT HINT IS GONE. The formatter now asks an opposite-pole
 *     question before the suggester: `dateField` sits between
 *     `startDateField` and `endDateField`, so the refusal names BOTH ("does
 *     not say which end of the range it binds … Write the one you mean") and
 *     prescribes neither. `endField` still draws no hint, and a one-char typo
 *     still resolves by distance (`titleFeld` → `titleField`) — all three
 *     measured on 17.5.0, and again on the
 *     installed 17.6.0 (objectui#11438).
 *
 * ⇒ through 17.4.0 a generic typo-distance suggester picked the wrong sibling.
 * It was not a declaration, it contradicted no declaration, and ⛔ no upstream
 * text says `dateField` means the end of an event.
 *
 * The author-facing hazard was real all the same: an author who copied that
 * hint wrote `endDateField` and bound the END of an event to the date they
 * meant as the START — accepted by every layer, wrong on screen. Every objectui read site
 * folds this spelling onto the START: the ladder this card retires did,
 * `normalizeListViewSchema`'s `timeline` fold does, `resolveTimelineDateBinding`
 * documents it as "the pre-#2231 alias for `startDateField`", and this package
 * has published "Deprecated alias for startDateField" on `TimelineConfig` for
 * releases. So these arms name `startDateField`. The remedy upstream needed was
 * a formatter answer that keeps the suggester from speaking for `dateField`;
 * 17.5.0's opposite-pole prescription is that answer (it declines to guess an
 * end, where these arms name one because objectui's own alias history does).
 * `endField` still draws nothing upstream. ⛔ Neither is fixed here — it is
 * upstream's formatter.
 *
 * ONE detail STEM, four installed arms, plus ONE consequence clause PER KEY.
 * ⚠️ The per-key split is not tidiness: the two spellings fail DIFFERENTLY when
 * left unrefused (see the clauses below), so a single shared consequence made

/**
 * The `object-calendar` ELEMENT's configuration container — a DIFFERENT contract

 * the reason the two are not one const (objectui#8651).
 *
 * Both derive from the same spec object. They differ on exactly one member, and
 * the difference is a read site, not a preference:
 *
 *   - a VIEW's block carries `defaultView`, and `ListView` LIFTS it onto the
 *     node it builds (`plugin-list/src/ListView.tsx`, the `calendar` branch),
 *     so the key is honoured from there.
 *   - this ELEMENT's block does not, because `ObjectCalendar` seeds its view
 *     state from the FLAT `defaultView` member of this schema and never looks
 *     inside the container. Declaring it here would advertise a write this
 *     renderer drops — `plugin-calendar/src/index.tsx` names that as this
 *     gate's own failure mode one layer in.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE MEMBER LIST IS objectui's OWN, and the spec does NOT supply it.
 * MEASURED on the installed `@objectstack/spec` 17.6.0 (the same answer
 * 17.5.0 and 17.4.0 gave):
 * `ComponentPropsMap['object-calendar'].calendar` is NOT `CalendarConfigSchema`
 * — it is `z.unknown().optional()` (wrapper chain `["optional","unknown"]`, and
 * not the same object reference), so at THIS position the protocol accepts
 * everything: a nonsense key, a wrong-typed member, even `calendar: 42` all
 * parse. `CalendarConfigSchema` is the strict object the spec uses for a LIST
 * VIEW's calendar block, which is a different position — four keys through
 * 17.4.0, five since 17.5.0 declared `allDayField` (objectui#11073).
 *
 * ⇒ what the protocol settles here is the KEY, not its SHAPE. The shape below
 * is objectui's, chosen as exactly the five members `ObjectCalendar.tsx`'s
 * events pass destructures out of the resolved config. Through 17.4.0 that was
 * the spec's four plus objectui's own `allDayField`, the same objectui-local
 * lane objectui#8466 took for the FLAT spelling of this vocabulary, on this same
 * interface, for the same renderer; since 17.5.0 it is the list view block's
 * five exactly.
 *
 * That makes this mirror STRICTER than the protocol at this position, which is
 * the sanctioned direction and not the forbidden one: objectui#8327's triage
 * ruling forbids accepting what the platform REFUSES, and under `BaseSchema`'s
 * `.passthrough()` — which already admitted this key unexamined — a declaration
 * can only narrow. The same asymmetry `filter` and `sort` already carry on this
 * block.
 *
 * ⛔ `.passthrough()` is kept, so this declaration refuses no KEY that parses
 * today: a `calendar` block carrying `defaultView`, or any other unexamined
 * key, still parses exactly as it did through `BaseSchema`'s own
 * `.passthrough()`. It does refuse VALUES, which is the whole of what declaring
 * buys — `calendar: 42` and `calendar: { startDateField: 42 }` are refused
 * where both were admitted unexamined before.
 *
 * ⚠️ The key/value split is stated that way on purpose. An earlier cut wrote
 * "REFUSES NOTHING that parses today", which is literally false for
 * `calendar: 42`: it parsed at the merge-base and is refused here. The colon
 * scoped it to keys and the next sentence gave the value narrowing, so it was
 * defensible — but a sentence that needs its own punctuation to stay true is
 * one reader away from being wrong, and the narrowing is the point of the
 * declaration rather than a footnote to it.

 * `dataset` is REFUSED at authoring (ruling 5825582592, letter A: a dataset
 * chart takes its scope from the dataset).
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * `ListView`'s `case 'chart'` builds the dataset shape's `object-chart` node
 * with NO `filter`: `ObjectChart` hands `queryDataset` the dimensions and the
 * measures and nothing else, and a dataset's field namespace need not be the
 * list object's, so the list's filter has no door into that query. The ruling
 * refused the mapping that would build one (option B). An authored filter here
 * was accepted and silently dropped, and the chart drew unfiltered totals that
 * read as filtered ones. At runtime the toolbar withholds its filter controls
 * on such a view (`ListView`'s `datasetChartOnScreen`).
 *
 * ## Why here, on objectui's face — the location the ruling left to the dev
 *
 * Both operand keys are the spec's own, imported by reference below: `filter`,
 * and the `chart` block (`ListChartConfigSchema`, whose `dataset` is required).
 * The CONDITION is not: on this node the view kind rides as objectui's
 * `viewType` (the spec's `type` is spent here on the component discriminator),
 * and two objectui-owned spellings reach the same render branch — the legacy
 * `filters` alias (folded into `filter` by `normalizeListViewSchema`) and the
 * legacy `options.chart` bag (read by `resolveListChartBinding` when no `chart`
 * block is declared). A spec-door check reads none of the three; that is the
 * reason `checkListViewPageMount` was not attachable here (objectui#7715). So
 * this node's refusal is objectui's. A stored `view` row spelled `type: 'chart'`
 * passes the SPEC's door, which is a second door and not this one.
 *
 * ## What it judges — the runtime's own reading, one leg each
 *
 *   - view kind: `viewType === 'chart'`, the value `ListView`'s `currentView`
 *     starts from;
 *   - binding: the effective chart block — `chart` WHOLESALE, else
 *     `options.chart`, `resolveListChartBinding`'s precedence — names a
 *     `dataset`;
 *   - filter: `filter`, and the legacy `filters`, each a non-empty array. An
 *     empty array is no filter and passes.
 *
 * One `custom` issue per written filter key, at that key. ⛔ Not judged: a view
 * of another kind that only OFFERS a switch to a dataset chart
 * (`appearance.allowedVisualizations`). Its filter scopes the view it is
 * authored on, so refusing it would refuse a working grid.

    //     `useNavigationOverlay` and `useDensityMode`) and declared on
    //     `ListViewRuntimeProps` (`../objectql.ts`), which is intersected into
    //     the `ListViewSchema` TYPE precisely so a host can put a function
    //     there. `@object-ui/app-shell`'s `ObjectView` builds a
    //     `const fullSchema: ListViewSchema` node carrying `onDensityChange`;
    //     `onNavigate` has no in-repo supplier on a `list-view` node, yet the
    //     channel is wired end to end and the read still fires.
    //   `onAddRecord` · `onBulkAction` · `onPageSizeChange`  read off the PROPS
    //     bag (`props.onX`). TWO supply paths reach that bag and both are live:
    //     a React host passes the prop to the component — `ListViewProps`
    //     (`@object-ui/plugin-list`) declares all three by name, and
    //     `StudioDesignSurface` supplies `onAddRecord` that way — or a host
    //     builds the NODE and `SchemaRenderer` spreads it in. The second path
    //     was typed only by `BaseSchema`'s index signature, so this slice
    //     declares the three on `ListViewRuntimeProps` as well, which is the
    //     same repair objectui#9344's slice made on `ObjectGallerySchema` for

  // judged by whether this node carries the fields the check reads:
  //
  //   `checkListViewCalendarVisualization` — ATTACHED. It reads
  //     `appearance.allowedVisualizations` (a spec field, by reference) and only
  //     whether `calendar` is PRESENT; the local `CalendarConfig` override keeps
  //     `calendar` omissible, so "absent" means the same thing on both faces and
  //     the refusal is the spec's own, message included.
  //   `checkListViewPageMount` — NOT ATTACHABLE. It reads `type`, and on this
  //     node `type` is the component discriminator `'list-view'`; the spec's view
  //     kind rides as `viewType`. Attached as-is it would refuse EVERY `pageName`,
  //     a valid page mount included, and its remedy tells the author to write
  //     `type: 'page'`, which this node's literal refuses. The spec kind it binds
  //     is retired upstream (objectstack#17063 — see `UNDRAWABLE_VIEW_KINDS` in
  //     `@object-ui/core`), so no adapter is written for it here.

 * deliberately applies no defaults ("an absent flag stays absent", its test suite).
 * Typing the surface as parsed output therefore rejected valid authored metadata
 * (`userActions: { sort: true }`, a tab without `pinned`/`visible`) while promising

 *
 *  - runtime: `ObjectMap`'s `safeParse` of the block now fails, so the
 *    component still renders and `console.warn`s the issue, which names the key;
 *  - validate: `ObjectMapSchema.map` is this object, so `safeValidateSchema`
 *    (and `objectui validate` with it) refuses the node with an
 *    `unrecognized_keys` issue at `map`;
 *  - `.shape` is untouched, so `ObjectMap`'s `FLAT_MAP_CONFIG_KEYS` (derived
 *    from it) and the view flatten whitelists (hand-listed, pinned against it)
 *    see the same keys as before.
 *
 * ⛔ The map block ONLY. Whether other component sub-block schemas close the
 * same way is a separate decision the ruling kept out of this card.

/**
 * `77cb489b4` — the record-source refinement `ObjectMapSchema`,
 * `ObjectGanttSchema` and `ObjectCalendarSchema` below share — and, since
 * objectui#11117, every gate-wrapped arm with a record-source requirement:
 * `ObjectKanbanSchema` with its own rung list, and `ObjectGridSchema` and
 * `ListViewSchema` with `objectName` alone (see the last section).
 *
 * Those renderers resolve their records from ONE of three keys, in this order:
 * `data`, `staticData` (inline rows, wrapped into a `{ provider: 'value' }`
 * config) or `objectName` (the bound object) — the shared ladder
 * `resolveRecordSourceConfig` in `@object-ui/core`, which
 * `plugin-map/src/ObjectMap.tsx` reaches through its local `getDataConfig`
 * wrapper and `plugin-gantt/src/ObjectGantt.tsx` calls directly: `data`, then
 * `staticData`, then `objectName`, else `null`. Both mirrors
 * used to REQUIRE `objectName` alone, so a document authored on `staticData`
 * (6 of the 20 catalog entries measured for the 2026-09-02 ruling) drew correctly and was
 * refused by `safeValidateSchema` — `declared !== enforced`, with the corpus
 * on the right side. `objectName` is optional on both members now, and this
 * refinement carries the requirement the renderers actually have: with none of
 * the three present the ladder returns `null` and nothing is drawn.
 *
 * Presence is `!== undefined` — the ruling's wording ("at least one of `data`,
 * `staticData`, `objectName` is present"), NOT the renderers' truthiness: an
 * empty `objectName: ''` validated before this card and still does, so the
 * accept set only WIDENS. The one document shape refused here (none of the
 * three) was refused before too, when `objectName` was required. Maintainer
 * ruling recorded 2026-09-02 (director seat, summon #8, decision batch #8).
 *
 * The issue carries `params.code` so a consumer can key off the finding rather
 * than string-match the message — the shape `FormFieldSchema`'s refinement in
 * `form.zod.ts` uses; zod's own `code` is `custom` for every refinement. The
 * path is the ROOT (`[]`): no single key is at fault when all three are absent,
 * and blaming `objectName` would re-teach the requiredness this card removes.
 *
 * Deliberately a `function`, not an `export const`: the parity census in
 * `__tests__/zod-mirror-parity.test.ts` reads `^export const` out of this
 * directory and would demand a registered TS counterpart for it.
 *
 * ⭐ WHAT `data` MEANS IS NOT SHARED, only its PRESENCE is (objectui#9239).
 * This refinement asks one question — is any rung declared? — and `!==
 * undefined` answers it whatever the value's kind, so the three members reach
 * it from two different arms:
 *
 *  - `object-map` / `object-gantt` — `data` is a spec `ViewData` PROVIDER BLOCK
 *    (`{ provider, … }`), the source the block will FETCH FROM. On the flat
 *    mirrors the member is this file's own `ViewDataSchema.optional()`; on the
 *    authored arms (`ObjectMapBlockSchema` and `ObjectGanttBlockSchema` below,
 *    objectui#10859 batches 5 and 6) it is the `data` member of the block's
 *    `ComponentPropsMap` row, the spec's `ViewData`, by reference.
 *  - `object-calendar` — `data` is an ARRAY of PRE-FETCHED RECORDS, drawn in
 *    place of the block's own query, NOT a source to fetch from.
 *    `ComponentPropsMap['object-calendar'].data` is `z.array(z.unknown())
 *    .optional()` on `@objectstack/spec` 17.4.0 and the renderer honours that
 *    arm alone since objectui#8348 (the shared ladder, called on the `'array'`
 *    arm — ⛔ the arm is the citation, not the call shape, which has moved);
 *    objectui#9239 brought this file's member onto it.
 *
 * ⛔ So do not read the message below as promising a fetchable source: on the
 * calendar, declaring `data` means handing the block rows it already has.
 *
 * ## The node's `dataSource` binding is a record source on every arm (objectui#11117)
 *
 * Every arm that installs this refinement is gate-wrapped: its registration is
 * `elementDataSourceBlock`, so `ElementDataSourceGate` (`@object-ui/react`)
 * lands a binding's `object` on `objectName` before the renderer reads the
 * node. A node whose `dataSource.object` names an object therefore HAS a
 * record source although it writes none of the rungs, and the spec accepts it:
 * the `ComponentPropsMap` rows its props gate judges for these blocks require
 * no object key (`list-view` has no row), and where a row does —
 * `element:number`'s `object` — the gate waives exactly that member beside
 * `dataSource.object`. So the binding counts here, on the
 * predicate the gate and the runtime both use: `dataSourceSuppliesObject`
 * from `./public-blocks.zod.ts`, the ONE copy, which `element:number`'s waiver
 * reads too. A NON-EMPTY string name only — `dataSource: { object: '' }`
 * supplies nothing, because `isElementDataSourceConfig` refuses it and the
 * gate then lands nothing on the node.
 *
 * ONE refinement for every gate-wrapped arm with a record-source requirement,
 * parameterised by the arm's own rung list, because the ladders genuinely
 * differ (`object-kanban` has `bind` and no `staticData`; `object-grid` and
 * `list-view` have `objectName` alone). What every arm shares is what this
 * function owns: presence as `!== undefined` on the rungs, the binding as the
 * last rung, the issue keyed `RECORD_SOURCE_REQUIRED`, and the message,
 * which names the binding as a remedy beside the rungs. The issue sits at the
 * ROOT when the arm has several rungs (no single key is at fault, as above),
 * and at the rung itself when it has one — `objectName` on `object-grid` and
 * `list-view`, the path the required member reported at, so a consumer that
 * locates the refusal by path (`objectui validate` prints it) still finds it
 * there.
 *
 * ⚠️ It returns the refinement AND its params, spread into `.superRefine()`,
 * because `when: () => true` is load-bearing: zod skips a refinement once an
 * earlier issue aborts the parse, and on `object-grid` and `list-view` this
 * refinement replaces a required member, whose `invalid_type` was reported
 * BESIDE every other issue on the node. Without it, a node with no object and
 * a bad `columns` would report only the `columns`. So the body reads the raw
 * input defensively — the node may be anything when it runs.
 *
 * ## `at: 'properties'` — the same rule, read where an AUTHORED block writes it
 *
 * objectui#10859 batch 5 moved the authored `object-map` arm into the spec's
 * `properties` bag (`ObjectMapBlockSchema` below), so on that arm the three
 * rungs are read INSIDE the bag: `SchemaRenderer` hoists them onto the node
 * before the renderer resolves its ladder. That arm counts the node's
 * `dataSource` binding as a source too, on the same `dataSourceSuppliesObject`
 * predicate as every other arm (the section above): the registration is
 * `elementDataSourceBlock`-wrapped, and `ElementDataSourceGate` lands the
 * binding's `object` on `objectName` before `ObjectMap` runs; the spec row keeps
 * its own `objectName` optional for exactly that reason. The default (`'node'`)
 * reads the rungs on the node, as the flat arms always have. objectui#10859
 * batch 6 moved the authored `object-gantt` arm the same way
 * (`ObjectGanttBlockSchema` below), with the same three rungs and the same
 * binding: its registration is `elementDataSourceBlock`-wrapped too.
 *
 * The two sections met in one merge (objectui#11117 merging objectui#10859
 * batch 5). Batch 5 counted the bag arm's binding by PRESENCE (`dataSource !==
 * undefined`); it now counts a NON-EMPTY `dataSource.object`, so the bag arm
 * refuses `dataSource: { object: '' }` with no rung, as every flat arm does
 * and as the runtime does: `isElementDataSourceConfig` refuses that binding and
 * the gate lands nothing, so the map has no record source. The bag arm also
 * gains `when: () => true` with the rest.

//
// The rule is the protocol's own: `ListViewSchema.conditionalFormatting[]`'s
// element, read BY REFERENCE through the import boundary and `.extend()`-ed —
// so it inherits that element's strictness (an undeclared key is refused with
// the spec's own "Unrecognized key(s) on this conditional formatting rule"
// message) and its `style` map, and moves with the installed spec. Two things
// are layered on top, and only two:
//
//   - `condition` is `SpecRuleConditionSchema`, the list view's and the grid's
//     own condition (objectui#10946): the spec slot by reference behind a
//     `z.string()` arm, so a string condition is not canonicalized into an
//     envelope and `''` is still accepted — the kanban rule judges a condition
//     exactly as the list view's `{ condition, style }` rule does.
//   - the retired keys are DECLARED and unwritable (`retirementTombstone()`),
//     so each is refused at its own path with the remedy instead of being one
//     more unrecognized key: the native comparison's `field` / `operator` /
//     `value`, and the three top-level colour keys the shared resolver
//     (`resolveConditionalFormatting`) would otherwise still paint with —
//     `backgroundColor` and `borderColor` (the native rule's, and the flat CEL
//     rule's), and `textColor`. `z.input` of each is `undefined`, which is the
//     TS twin's `?: never`.
//
// Before this, the member was a union of the native comparison and the spec
// shape (#1584), exported by objectui#7664 for the since-retired `'kanban'`
// arm. ⚠️ The shared resolver is NOT narrowed: since objectui#11533 no authored
// rule declares the native arms (the grid's and the list view's rule,
// `ConditionalFormattingRuleSchema` above, retired them too), but a rule STORED
// in that dialect still reaches the resolver, which keeps every arm as a
// compatibility read — so the board itself still paints whatever a relay hands
// it. What retired is the AUTHORED kanban member. Its TS twin is
// `KanbanConditionalFormattingRule` (`../objectql.ts`); the two faces are
// pinned equal in `../__tests__/kanban-conditional-formatting.test.ts`. The
// element it extends, `SpecListViewRuleSchema`, is declared above the grid's

/**
 * The `object-kanban` board has a record source — at least one of `bind`,
 * `data`, `objectName` is present (objectui#7780), or the node's
 * `dataSource.object` names the object (objectui#11117).
 *
 * ⚠️ `requireRecordSource` above, with THIS board's rung list — not the
 * `object-map` / `object-gantt` / `object-calendar` one. Those rungs are
 * `data` (a `ViewData` PROVIDER BLOCK) → `staticData` → `objectName`, resolved
 * by the shared `resolveRecordSourceConfig` in `@object-ui/core`. This board
 * walks a DIFFERENT ladder in `plugin-kanban/src/ObjectKanban.tsx`: the
 * pre-fetched `data` PROP → `useDataScope(schema.bind)` → the inline ROW ARRAY
 * on `schema.data` → a fetch keyed by `schema.objectName`
 * (`rawData = external || boundData || schema.data || fetchedData`, the fetch
 * gated on `schema.objectName && !boundData && !schema.data`). It has NO
 * `staticData` rung and it HAS a `bind` rung, so the two key sets are neither
 * equal nor nested and one key list cannot serve both — which is why
 * `requireRecordSource` takes the rung list per arm (objectui#11117) rather
 * than this board carrying a hand copy of the predicate, as it did until then.
 * objectui#7651 (ruled B, closed `not_planned`) refuses giving this board the
 * shared RUNTIME ladder; this refinement describes the ladder that is already
 * there rather than adding one. The binding rung is the gate's, not the
 * board's: `ElementDataSourceGate` lands `dataSource.object` on `objectName`
 * before `ObjectKanban` reads the node, so the fetch rung is what it feeds.
 *
 * The pre-fetched `data` PROP is NOT a key here: it is a React prop
 * (`ObjectKanbanComponentProps.data`, passed by a parent such as `ListView`),
 * not something an author writes on the node, so it can neither be declared
 * nor required.
 *
 * `bind` and `data` are `BaseSchema` members on BOTH faces — declared once, on
 * the base, as optional members (`base.zod.ts` here, `../base.ts` there) and
 * INHERITED by this member rather than restated on it. So this refinement names
 * no key its own mirror has never heard of, the property objectui#7313 had to
 * buy by declaring `data` / `staticData` first, and it names no key this
 * member re-declares — `base-bind-declared.test.ts` (objectui#6357) keeps the
 * `bind` declaration single, and the identity assertion in
 * `__tests__/object-kanban-record-source-7780.test.ts` keeps both inherited.
 *
 * Presence is `!== undefined`, matching the sibling predicate's wording rather
 * than the renderer's truthiness: `objectName: ''` validated before this card
 * and still does, so the accept set only WIDENS. The one shape refused here
 * (none of the three present) was refused before too, when `objectName` was
 * required — see the before/after table in
 * `__tests__/object-kanban-record-source-7780.test.ts`.
 *
 * ⛔ `groupBy` is NOT a rung: a record source and a lane key are different
 * questions (objectui#7322, PR #7774; `groupBy` itself is optional since
 * objectui#8990). The `dataSource` json fragment in
 * `content/docs/utilities/data-objectstack.mdx` — `{ type, dataSource }`, no
 * `groupBy` and none of the three rungs — parses since objectui#11117, on the
 * binding rung.
 *
 * Carries `params.code` so a consumer keys off the finding rather than
 * string-matching the message, and reports at the ROOT path (`[]`): no single
 * key is at fault when all three are absent, and blaming `objectName` would
 * re-teach the requiredness this card removes.
 *
 * The rung list is a private `const` and the refinement is
 * `requireRecordSource`, a `function`: the parity census in
 * `__tests__/zod-mirror-parity.test.ts` reads `^export const` out of this
 * directory and would demand a registered TS counterpart for either.
 */
/**
 * The `object-kanban` SWIMLANE element (objectui#8913) — the mirror half of
 * `ObjectKanbanSchema.columns` in `../objectql.ts`, whose docblock carries the
 * measurements. Private on purpose: it publishes no new symbol, so the
 * `zod-mirror-parity` census (which pairs `^export const` mirrors with a TS
 * declaration) has nothing new to register, exactly as `requireRecordSource`
 * is a `function` for the same reason.
 *
 * ⭐ Both arms, because `@objectstack/spec` admits both. Its
 * `ObjectKanbanPropsSchema.columns` is `z.array(z.unknown()).optional()` and
 * states the shape in its `describe` prose — "{ id, title } per `groupBy`
 * value, or bare value strings". Admitting only the object arm would make this
 * repository NARROWER than the protocol, which the maintainer principle in
 * force forbids (2026-09-09, verbatim, untranslated):
 * 「我们的项目以 objectstack 协议为准，文档应该以实际实现为准。协议不正确的应该先修改协议。」
 *
 * ⛔ Both arms WHOLE, not per element: `columns` is a UNION OF TWO ARRAYS, and
 * a MIXED array is refused. objectui#8913's first cut spelled it
 * `z.array(z.union([...]))` and so admitted a mix. `effectiveColumns` dispatches
 * on `columns[0]` alone, so an object-first mix pushes every string element
 * through the object branch and a string-first mix is ignored whole; measured
 * on the real bucketer with `[{ id: 'done', title: 'Done' }, 'todo']` the lanes
 * are `done:r2, undefined:, __uncolumned__:r1` — a blank lane whose own keys
 * are `["0","1","2","3","cards"]` and the `todo` record in "Uncategorized".
 * The protocol names no mixed example. A declaration that admits a shape the
 * renderer mishandles is the defect this card removes, so it is refused here.
 *
 * ⭐ The STRING arm is REACHABLE since objectui#8990. The renderer's string
 * branch returns only under `if (!schema.groupBy)`, and `groupBy` was required
 * on this face — so objectui#8913 admitted the arm (refusing it would have
 * been a second narrowing) while recording that nothing could reach it.
 * objectui#8990 made `groupBy` OPTIONAL, and a `groupBy`-less board with
 * `columns: ['todo', 'doing']` now parses AND draws those two lanes, titled by
 * the RAW strings rather than the picklist labels a grouped board would show.
 * ⚠️ Reachable is not populated — a lane-less board holds zero cards, because
 * `bucketCardsIntoColumns` returns before distributing records when there is
 * no lane key.
 *
 * ⛔ NOT `KanbanColumnSchema`, whose `cards` is REQUIRED: that mirror is the
 * RUNTIME lane (`bucketCardsIntoColumns` fills `cards` before `KanbanImpl`
 * sees it), and requiring it here would refuse the protocol's own
 * gate-validated `{ id, title }` example, the lanes the renderer materializes
 * from a picklist, and this repository's own typed board fixtures. `cards` is
 * therefore optional and the two mirrors stay separate rather than one being
 * derived from the other — the faces genuinely differ, and a derivation would
 * make a future edit to the retired arm's lane silently move this one.
 *
 * `cards` reuses `KanbanCardSchema` (`./complex.zod.ts`) rather than restating
 * it: the card vocabulary has one authority, and reaching it is what restores
 * the judging `240b80f31` established — a lane card with no `title` is refused again.

/**
 * `object-chart` — the AUTHORED node: its props in the `properties` bag
 * (objectui#11276, the `object-chart` batch of triage's routing call A).
 *
 * ## Why the arm moved to the bag
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s strict `PageComponentSchema` refuses a prop written on
 * a page component itself as mis-layered (ADR-0089 D3a), for every component
 * type: `properties` is the only home of a component's own props. This union
 * used to arm the node with the flat `ObjectChartSchema` above, so `objectui
 * validate` refused the spec-shaped document — the objectstack showcase's
 * command-center charts, `{ type: 'object-chart', responsiveStyles,
 * properties: { dataset, dimensions, values, chartType, colors, yAxis } }` —
 * and accepted the flat one `os validate` refuses. Triage's answer on
 * objectui#11276 is this arm: "the `properties` bag is the contract on these
 * three arms too", released for `object-chart` first.
 *
 * It is the construct `ObjectFormBlockSchema` and `ObjectMapBlockSchema` use
 * (objectui#10859, batches 4 and 5) — `BaseSchema` + the `type` literal +
 * `NODE_ENVELOPE` + `properties` through `propsBag` + one `aliasKeyRefusal`
 * per bag member — with ONE difference, stated rather than hidden: ⛔ there is
 * no spec row to read. `ComponentPropsMap` carries no `object-chart` row, so
 * the bag is `ObjectChartPropsBag` above, the flat mirror's own members by
 * reference, and its description says so instead of naming a row.
 *
 * ## The flat spelling is refused by name
 *
 * Every member of the bag written FLAT on the node is refused on both faces,
 * with a message naming its bag member (`OBJECT_CHART_FLAT_PROP_REFUSALS`
 * above). The three list-view spellings objectui#10608 retired
 * (`xAxisField`, `yAxisFields`, `aggregation`) are the exception: written flat
 * they keep the flat mirror's own retirement tombstones (the same objects, by
 * reference), whose remedy is the spec spelling rather than a bag member that
 * is itself retired. In the bag they are refused by the same tombstones.
 * `BaseSchema`'s keys stay on the node, as on every arm. A key the chart does
 * not declare is left as every arm leaves an undeclared key: unjudged by the
 * tolerant face, refused by the strict one.
 *
 * ## The chart family, `dataSource` and the content channels
 *
 * The flat mirror's chart-family floor (objectui#10770) stays on the authored
 * node, read in the bag (`requireObjectChartFamilyInBag`). The registration is
 * `elementDataSourceBlock`-wrapped, so `dataSource` is the spec's
 * `ElementDataSourceSchema` by reference, on the NODE beside the bag, as on
 * `ObjectFormBlockSchema` and `ObjectMapBlockSchema` (objectui#11070; it is
 * one of `OBJECT_CHART_NODE_LEVEL_KEYS`, so it is not a bag member and is not
 * refused flat). Neither content channel is read, so both are refused with
 * the objectui#9256 string the flat mirror uses.
 *
 * ## What did not move
 *
 * The TypeScript `ObjectChartSchema` and its zod mirror above stay published:
 * they are the node as `ObjectChart` reads it after `SchemaRenderer` hoists the
 * bag, and as code composes it — `ObjectView`, `ListView`, the dashboard
 * renderers and the react-page wrapper all build a flat `object-chart` node.
 * Those keep working, because `SchemaRenderer` reads both spellings and no
 * composed node passes through `safeValidateSchema`.

 * for the same reason. Its TypeScript twin is the node as `ObjectMap` reads it,
 * and the authored `object-map` node is armed by `ObjectMapBlockSchema` below.

/**
 * `object-metric` — `ComponentPropsMap['object-metric']` (objectui#10859,
 * batch 2).
 *
 * ## Why it is armed here, and from what
 *
 * `object-metric` is registered by `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard`
 * (`ObjectMetricBlock`, which renders `ObjectMetricWidget`), curated by
 * ADR-0080 as a public block (`PUBLIC_BLOCKS` in `@object-ui/core`) and
 * declared by the spec — and until this arm `AnyComponentSchema` carried none
 * for it, so `safeValidateSchema` and `objectui validate` refused every
 * document naming it with `invalid_union` at `type`.
 *
 * `@object-ui/types` has no TypeScript declaration of this node: the spec's
 * row is the one published declaration of what it takes. (The widget's React
 * props, `ObjectMetricWidgetProps`, describe the component after the node is
 * resolved — a translator function and a React-node icon among them — and are
 * not a document shape.) So the arm is built the way `./public-blocks.zod.ts`
 * builds every arm whose declaration is a `ComponentPropsMap` row
 * (objectui#10872): `BaseSchema` + the `type` literal + `properties`, which IS
 * the row, by reference through the objectui#8317 import boundary. Members,
 * value types, strictness and the spec's own refusals all arrive from the
 * spec; nothing is restated, so nothing can drift.
 *
 * ## Where the props live
 *
 * The bag is the spelling the platform's authored documents use — every
 * `object-metric` the objectstack showcase ships is `{ type, properties }` —
 * and the one the page designer writes; `SchemaRenderer` hoists it onto the
 * node before `ObjectMetricBlock` runs. A member of the row written FLAT on the
 * node is refused by name on both faces, naming its bag member, exactly as on
 * the public blocks next door (`flatPropRefusals`, objectui#10872 batch 10;
 * triage's answer A there made the bag the contract for the whole family).
 * `description`, a `BaseSchema` key the row also declares, is refused flat the
 * same way; `label` stays on the node, where the spec's page component
 * declares a `label` of its own. A composed flat node keeps rendering —
 * `DashboardRenderer` builds one — because `SchemaRenderer` reads both
 * spellings and no composed node passes through `safeValidateSchema`.
 *
 * ## `dataSource` (the node's binding)
 *
 * `ObjectMetricBlock` is `elementDataSourceBlock`-wrapped and reads the node's
 * `dataSource` through `ElementDataSourceGate`. That key is the spec's
 * `PageComponentSchema.dataSource`, not a props-row member, so it is declared
 * as the spec's `ElementDataSourceSchema`, by reference — the construct the
 * module's other gate-wrapped arms use (objectui#11070). Without it the strict
 * authoring face refused a spec-valid bound node by name (objectui#10859,
 * batch 3). `object-master-detail-form` below declares it the same way.
 *
 * ## The content channels (objectui#9256)
 *
 * The renderer reads NEITHER content channel, so the arm declares `children`
 * as a by-name refusal and restates `body` with the same guidance — as the
 * public blocks in `./public-blocks.zod.ts` do, and for the same reason:
 * `BaseSchema` already refuses `body`, but names `children` as the remedy.
 * Both stay MEMBERS. `object-master-detail-form` below does the same.

 * at `type`.
 *
 * `@object-ui/types` has no TypeScript declaration of this node (the plugin's

 * among them, not a document shape), so the arm is built exactly as

 * (`timeline.scale`, the `navigation` members), so the boundary hands back a
 * rebuilt copy with every default removed and every key still omissible:
 * this face judges the bag and writes nothing into it.
 *
 * ## Where the props live
 *
 * In the bag, as on its neighbours above: `SchemaRenderer` hoists
 * `properties` onto the node before the renderer runs, so the spec's
 * `{ type, properties }` document renders what the flat one does. A member of
 * the row written FLAT on the node is refused by name on both faces, naming its
 * bag member (`flatPropRefusals`, objectui#10872 batch 10), `data` among them,
 * though `BaseSchema` declares a `data` of its own; a composed flat node, the
 * one `ListView` hands over, keeps rendering because `SchemaRenderer` reads
 * both spellings and no composed node passes through `safeValidateSchema`. Inside
 * the bag, the row itself leaves out the flat field spellings beside
 * `timeline` (`titleField`, `startDateField` and their siblings) and `scale`:
 * the spec's record for the row calls them the runtime handoff `ListView`
 * composes, not a second authoring spelling, so the bag refuses them by name.
 *
 * ## `dataSource` (the node's binding)
 *
 * The registration is wrapped in `elementDataSourceBlock`, so the node reaches
 * `ObjectTimeline` through `ElementDataSourceGate`, which reads the node's
 * `dataSource` and maps its `object`, `filter`, `sort` and `limit` onto the
 * fetch. That key is not a props-row member: it is the spec's
 * `PageComponentSchema.dataSource`, so it is declared as the spec's
 * `ElementDataSourceSchema`, by reference — as `object-grid` and the other
 * gate-wrapped arms of this module declare it (objectui#11070), and as
 * `element:number` does beside its own row.
 *
 * ## The content channels (objectui#9256)
 *
 * Neither `ObjectTimeline` nor the renderer it composes reads a content
 * channel, so the arm refuses `children` by name and restates `body` with the
 * same guidance, both kept MEMBERS — as the two arms above do.

 * meets the remedy rather than a bare `unrecognized_keys` — which, since

 * (`flatPropRefusals`, the shared helper; this arm keeps its own map and
 * message). `description` is also a `BaseSchema` key; here the
 * refusal overrides it, because the form's description is the row's member.
 * A key the row does not declare (`buttons`, `defaults`, `subforms`, `groups`)
 * is left as every arm leaves an undeclared key: unjudged by the tolerant face,

 *
 * ## What did not move
 *
 * The TypeScript `ObjectFormSchema` and its zod mirror above stay published:
 * they are the node as `ObjectForm` reads it after the hoist, and as code

 * passes through `safeValidateSchema` (`SchemaRenderer` runs `@object-ui/core`'s

 *

 * inherited from objectui#10872's triage answer A, is this arm: "The

 * (`properties.latitudeField`) is refused there with the spec's wrong-layer
 * prescription, and `properties.filters` with the alias's.
 *
 * ## The flat spelling is refused by name
 *
 * Every member of the row written FLAT on the node is refused on both faces,
 * with a message naming its bag member (`OBJECT_MAP_FLAT_PROP_REFUSALS`
 * above). `data` is also a `BaseSchema` key; here the refusal overrides it,
 * because the map's `data` is the row's member. The flat mirror's two
 * remaining compatibility members, `locationField` and `titleField`, are
 * refused too: their bag home is the row's `map` block, so the remedy names
 * `properties.map.KEY`. A flat key neither the row nor the mirror declares
 * (`latitudeField` and the other flat `map`-config spellings) is left as every
 * arm leaves an undeclared key: unjudged by the tolerant face, refused by the
 * strict one.
 *
 * ## The record source, `dataSource` and the content channels
 *
 * The record-source rule the flat mirror carries (`77cb489b4`, the maintainer
 * ruling recorded 2026-09-02) stays on the authored node, read in the bag:
 * `requireRecordSource(…, 'properties')` asks for one of `properties.data`,
 * `properties.staticData` or `properties.objectName`, or the node's
 * `dataSource` binding naming its object (a non-empty `dataSource.object`, the
 * predicate every gate-wrapped arm shares since objectui#11117), which
 * `ElementDataSourceGate` lands on `objectName` (the registration is
 * `elementDataSourceBlock`-wrapped). ⚠️ The spec row is
 * looser here: it keeps all three optional and adds no such rule, so a node
 * with no source and no binding passes the spec's own page component and is
 * refused by this arm, as the flat mirror refused it. The binding itself is
 * the spec's `ElementDataSourceSchema` by reference, as on the arms above.
 * Neither content channel is read, so both are refused with the objectui#9256
 * string the flat mirror uses.
 *
 * ## What did not move
 *

 * they are the node as `ObjectMap` reads it after the hoist, and as

/**
 * `object-gantt` — `ComponentPropsMap['object-gantt']`, plus the node's
 * `dataSource` binding (objectui#10859, batch 6).
 *
 * ## Why the arm moved to the bag
 *
 * The spec's row is the published declaration of an authored `object-gantt`
 * node's props, and the spec's strict `PageComponentSchema` refuses a prop
 * written on the node itself as mis-layered (ADR-0089 D3a). This union used
 * to arm the node with the flat `ObjectGanttSchema` above, so `objectui
 * validate` refused the spec-shaped `{ type, properties }` document (its
 * record-source refinement found no source on the node) and accepted the flat
 * one `os validate` refuses. The seat's answer at PR objectui#11248's ACCEPT,
 * inherited from objectui#10872's triage answer A, is this arm: "The
 * `properties` bag is the contract". `ObjectMapBlockSchema` above is the same
 * move for `object-map` (batch 5).
 *
 * So it is built exactly as `ObjectTimelineBlockSchema` above is: `BaseSchema`
 * + the `type` literal + `properties`, which IS the row, by reference through
 * the objectui#8317 import boundary. Like that row, this one carries spec
 * defaults (inside `data`'s `api` provider), so the boundary hands back a
 * rebuilt copy with every default removed and every key still omissible. The
 * row is strict and carries the spec's own refusals: a flat `GanttConfig` key
 * written in the bag (`properties.startDateField`) is refused there with the
 * spec's prescription to move it into `gantt`, and so are the `search` pair
 * and `title`, which the row deliberately leaves out.
 *
 * ## The flat spelling is refused by name
 *
 * Every member of the row written FLAT on the node is refused on both faces,
 * with a message naming its bag member (`OBJECT_GANTT_FLAT_PROP_REFUSALS`
 * above). `data` is also a `BaseSchema` key; here the refusal overrides it,
 * because the gantt's `data` is the row's member. `label` is the one row member
 * that stays: the spec's page component declares a node-level `label` of its
 * own, so a `label` on the node is not mis-layered, and it keeps `BaseSchema`'s
 * member. The flat mirror's `GanttConfig` members and its `dependencyField`
 * alias are refused too, pointed at the bag's `gantt` block
 * (`OBJECT_GANTT_FLAT_CONFIG_REFUSALS` above). A flat key neither the row nor
 * that block declares — the mirror's `search` / `searchableFields`, which a
 * list view writes onto the node it composes, among them — is left as every
 * arm leaves an undeclared key: unjudged by the tolerant face, refused by the
 * strict one.
 *
 * ## The record source, `dataSource` and the content channels
 *
 * The record-source rule the flat mirror carries (`77cb489b4`, the maintainer
 * ruling recorded 2026-09-02) stays on the authored node, read in the bag, as
 * on `ObjectMapBlockSchema`: `requireRecordSource(…, 'properties')` asks for
 * one of `properties.data`, `properties.staticData` or
 * `properties.objectName`, or the node's `dataSource` binding naming its object
 * (a non-empty `dataSource.object`), which `ElementDataSourceGate` lands on
 * `objectName` (the registration is `elementDataSourceBlock`-wrapped). So a
 * node bound only through `dataSource` parses. ⚠️ The spec row is looser here:
 * it keeps all three optional and adds no such rule, so a node with no source
 * and no binding passes the spec's own page component and is refused by this
 * arm, as the flat mirror refused it. The binding itself is the spec's
 * `ElementDataSourceSchema` by reference, as on the arms above. Neither content
 * channel is read, so both are refused with the objectui#9256 string the flat
 * mirror uses.
 *
 * ## What did not move
 *
 * The TypeScript `ObjectGanttSchema` and its zod mirror above stay published:
 * they are the node as `ObjectGantt` reads it after the hoist, and as
 * `ObjectView` / `ListView` compose it when they flatten a stored gantt view. A
 * composed flat node keeps working, because `SchemaRenderer` reads both
 * spellings and no composed node passes through `safeValidateSchema`.

 * `object-grid` — `ComponentPropsMap['object-grid']`, plus the node's
 * `dataSource` binding (objectui#11276, the `object-grid` batch of triage's
 * routing call A).
 *
 * ## Why the arm moved to the bag
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s strict `PageComponentSchema` refuses a prop written on
 * a page component itself as mis-layered (ADR-0089 D3a), for every component
 * type: `properties` is the only home of a component's own props. This union
 * used to arm the node with the flat `ObjectGridSchema` above, so `objectui
 * validate` refused the spec-shaped document — the objectstack showcase's work
 * queues, `{ type: 'object-grid', properties: { objectName, columns, filter } }`
 * (its record-source refinement found no source on the node, and the strict
 * face named `properties` as an unrecognized key) — and accepted the flat one
 * `os validate` refuses. Triage's answer on objectui#11276 is this arm: "A
 * block schema takes the `properties` bag, while the flat mirror keeps the
 * `object-view` table slot."
 *
 * It is the construct `ObjectFormBlockSchema`, `ObjectMapBlockSchema` and
 * `ObjectGanttBlockSchema` use (objectui#10859, batches 4 to 6): `BaseSchema` +
 * the `type` literal + `NODE_ENVELOPE` + `properties`, which IS the spec's row,
 * by reference through the objectui#8317 import boundary. The row carries spec
 * defaults (inside `data`'s `api` provider), so the boundary hands back a
 * rebuilt copy with every default removed and every key still omissible. The
 * row is strict and carries the spec's own refusals and prescriptions: an
 * undeclared key in the bag is refused there, `properties.operators` with the
 * spec's "Did you mean `operators` → `operations`?", and the record form of
 * `filter` with the spec's ViewFilterRule prescription.
 *
 * ## The flat spelling is refused by name
 *
 * Every member of the row written FLAT on the node is refused on both faces,
 * with a message naming its bag member — `flatPropRefusals`, the shared helper
 * the `object-metric`, `object-master-detail-form` and `object-timeline` arms
 * above spread, read off the row's own key set. It already encodes the two
 * exceptions this row needs: `label` is a node-level key of the spec's page
 * component too (its display label), so a `label` on the node is not
 * mis-layered and keeps `BaseSchema`'s member; and `defaultSort` is a member
 * the row itself retires, so written flat it gets the row's own retirement.
 * `data` is also a `BaseSchema` key; here the refusal overrides it, because the
 * grid's `data` is the row's member.
 *
 * The flat mirror's own retirements that are not row members keep their
 * tombstones when written flat — the mirror's members, by reference:
 * `operators` (objectui#9739), and `rowSpecActions`, `bulkSpecActions`, `name`,
 * `placeholder`, `showFilters` (objectui#11068). `name` and `placeholder` are
 * `BaseSchema` keys, so without the tombstone they would parse again. In the
 * bag the row refuses each of them. `onNavigate`, which `ObjectGrid` reads off
 * the node, is declared exactly as the mirror declares it, an objectui#6124
 * runtime slot. A flat
 * key neither the row nor those declare — the mirror's `emptyState` and
 * `keyboardNavigation` among them — is left as every arm leaves an undeclared
 * key: unjudged by the tolerant face, refused by the strict one; the row
 * refuses both inside the bag too.
 *
 * ## The record source, `dataSource` and the content channels
 *
 * The flat mirror's record-source rule (objectui#11117: `objectName`, or the
 * node's binding naming the object) stays on the authored node, read in the
 * bag, as on `ObjectMapBlockSchema`: `requireRecordSource(…, 'properties')`
 * asks for `properties.objectName`, or the node's `dataSource` binding naming
 * its object (a non-empty `dataSource.object`), which `ElementDataSourceGate`
 * lands on `objectName` (the registration is `elementDataSourceBlock`-wrapped).
 * ⚠️ The spec row is looser here: it keeps `objectName` optional and adds no
 * such rule, so a node with no source passes the spec's own page component and
 * is refused by this arm, as the flat mirror refused it. The binding itself is
 * the spec's `ElementDataSourceSchema` by reference, as on the arms above.
 * Neither content channel is read, so both are refused with the objectui#9256
 * string the flat mirror uses.
 *
 * ## What did not move
 *
 * The TypeScript `ObjectGridSchema` and its zod mirror above stay published:
 * they are the node as `ObjectGrid` reads it after the hoist, and as code
 * composes it (`ObjectView`, `ListView`, the designers). The mirror also keeps
 * building the `object-view` `table` slot. A composed flat node keeps working,
 * because `SchemaRenderer` reads both spellings and no composed node passes

 * The public blocks above, as one arm of `AnyComponentSchema`
 * (objectui#10859, batches 2 to 6).
 *
 * A union of its own rather than more members of `ObjectQLComponentSchema`,
 * deliberately: that union mirrors the TypeScript union in `../objectql.ts`
 * member for member, and the authored node of each block here is declared by
 * the spec row its `properties` member reads, not there. `object-form`,
 * `object-map` and `object-gantt` are the spec-row arms with a member there:
 * each TypeScript twin is the node as its renderer reads it after the hoist,
 * not the authored document (batches 4 to 6).
 *
 * `object-chart` joined in objectui#11276, the one arm here with NO spec row:
 * `ComponentPropsMap` carries no `object-chart` entry, so its bag is the flat
 * `ObjectChartSchema` mirror's own members by reference, and its TypeScript
 * twin is likewise the node as `ObjectChart` reads it after the hoist.
 *
 * `object-grid` joined in objectui#11276's next batch, a spec-row arm like
 * `object-form`: its TypeScript twin is the node as `ObjectGrid` reads it after
 * the hoist, and its flat mirror keeps building the `object-view` `table` slot.
 *
 * `object-pivot` and `embeddable-form` joined in objectui#11440, two more arms
 * with NO spec row and, unlike `object-chart`, no flat mirror either: each bag
 * is built from the block's registration `inputs`, and no TypeScript
 * declaration in this package restates the node.
 *
 * Each arm also spreads `NODE_ENVELOPE` from `./public-blocks.zod.ts`,
 * the node-level `responsiveStyles` every public block declares by reference to
 * the spec's `PageComponentSchema` (objectui#10872 batch 8) — the same one
 * declaration, not a copy of it. `ObjectGridSchema` and `ObjectChartSchema`
 * above spread it too (objectui#10872 batch 9).
