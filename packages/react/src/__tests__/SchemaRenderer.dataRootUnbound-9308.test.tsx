 * objectui#9308 — the data-source ADAPTER stops being an expression root, and
 * `bind` starts resolving the scope channel instead.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling, 2026-09-13, option B, in two halves:
 *
 *   b1. `data: dataSource` leaves the evaluator scope `SchemaRenderer` builds.
 *       `data` is no longer a root this tier binds.
 *   b2. `useDataScope` stops walking `context.dataSource` and reads
 *       `usePredicateScope()` — the ambient scope a host publishes through
 *       `PredicateScopeProvider`, which app-shell's `ExpressionProvider`
 *       already feeds.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a new direction
 *
 * `ExpressionProvider` states the governing principle for the tier above:
 * "Every root below is one the engine accepts AND one this tier can actually
 * answer". objectui#8155 unbound `app` under it and objectui#8166 unbound
 * `data`. Against a conformant `DataSource` adapter every `data.*` path already
 * resolved `undefined`, so the renderer tier could not answer the root it
 * bound. This file applies the same principle one tier down.
 *
 * ## The legs, and what each one would have to break to go green wrongly
 *
 * Legs 1 and 2 are a PAIR on one coordinate: the injected object is the same
 * bag in both, and only the CHANNEL it arrives through moves. An
 * implementation that simply stopped resolving expressions would pass leg 1
 * and fail leg 2; one that kept the adapter bound would fail leg 1 and pass
 * leg 2. Neither can pass both.
 *
 * Leg 3 is the shadowing the ruling's own appendix named: `...predicateScope`
 * was spread BEFORE `data: dataSource`, so a host that legitimately published
 * `data` through the documented scope channel was silently overwritten by the
 * adapter. b1 removes the overwrite, and this leg is the only place that says
 * so.
 *
 * Legs 4-6 are the same coordinate pair for `useDataScope`, plus its own lit
 * control (a hook that returned `undefined` unconditionally would pass leg 5
 * and fail legs 4 and 6).
 *
 * Leg 7 records a VERDICT MOVE, measured rather than assumed. `data` was a key
 * whose value happened to be undefined-at-every-path; it is now ABSENT. The
 * engine distinguishes the two: `data.status == 'draft'` against
 * `{ data: undefined }` is a clean `false`, and against a scope with no `data`
 * key at all it THROWS `data is not defined` — which `evaluateCondition`
 * answers fail-soft with `true`. So a node whose `visible` gate read `data.*`
 * was hidden on every row before this card and is SHOWN on every row after it,
 * and the objectui#5454 reporter — which is the loud one, and the true one —
 * names it. That is the breaking half of this change, and it is pinned here
 * rather than discovered in a console.
 *
 * Module-scope imports, never `beforeAll` (AGENTS.md 测试纪律): registering a
 * renderer is an unbounded module load and must not be billed to a bounded
 * hook timeout.
