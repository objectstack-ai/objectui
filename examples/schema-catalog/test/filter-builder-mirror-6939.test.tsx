 * objectui#6939, the `filter-builder` group — the RENDER half. The
 * validator-side contract is pinned in
 * `packages/types/src/__tests__/filter-builder-mirror-6939.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why the render half is the discriminating half
 *
 * From objectui#6318's triage: a "correction" that renders identically proves
 * the SCHEMA was wrong, not the fixture. A repair on the schema side has to
 * clear the mirror image of that bar — the validator's verdict must change and
 * the renderer's output must NOT. `PRE_REPAIR` was measured on `origin/main` at
 * `3e01cb55f`, BOTH faces untouched, through THIS file's `measure()`.
 *
 * ⚠️ Measured directly through `SchemaRenderer`, never through a parse-then-
 * render path: at base four of these five entries FAIL `safeValidateSchema`, so
 * anything that validates first cannot run at base and the "before" column
 * would not exist.
 *
 * ⚠️ Element counts are harness-bound — the docs-gallery harness
 * (`catalog-gallery-render.test.tsx`: provider, `SidebarProvider`, a padded
 * wrapper) gives different absolutes for the same tile — so identity WITHIN one
 * harness is the claim that discriminates, and the numbers below are recorded
 * from this harness rather than carried over from the card.
 *
 * Three readings per tile, because a count alone cannot tell a swapped element
 * from an equal one: element count, a tag census, and the text (literally, plus
 * a SHA-256 of it).
 *
 * ## The second thing this file measures
 *
 * The mirror change is a set of key-name and vocabulary MOVES, so "identical
 * render" is necessary but not sufficient — each spelling the mirror now names
 * has to be a spelling the renderer actually distinguishes. `the vocabulary is
 * live` drives one condition row per member and reads the control it draws.
 * Every assertion in this file is legal in BOTH states of the change (the
 * renderer is untouched by it), so none of them can redden for the repair
 * rather than for the thing it controls for.

/**
 * Measured on `origin/main` @ `3e01cb55f` through `measure()` below, both faces
 * untouched. Four of the five reported `: Invalid input` from
 * `safeValidateSchema` at that commit — `search-interface` roots at `stack` and
 * validated, while the `filter-builder` it wraps did not — and every one of the
 * five drew exactly this.
 *
 * ⚠️ ⭐ The empty operator triggers this table used to record are GONE, and
 * that is the later fix this note was written for: objectui#7561 routed the
 * operator `Select`'s identity comparison through `normalizeFilterOperator`,
 * so `eq` / `gt` / `lt` — the spec's alias table, which these entries author —
 * now resolve to the mounted `SelectItem` and the trigger names the operator.
 * Three of the five readings moved with it, in `text` and `sha256` only:
 *
 *   `…Clear allCategoryRemove condition…` → `…Clear allCategoryEqualsRemove condition…`
 *
 * `elements` and the tag census did NOT move for any entry — the label lands
 * in a span the trigger already mounted — which is why those two columns are
 * untouched below and are the reading that says this was a text change, not a
 * structural one.
 *
 * ⛔ The values below are therefore no longer all `3e01cb55f`: the three
 * entries with condition rows are re-measured post-#7561 through this same
 * `measure()`, and the two empty ones are unchanged from the original run.
 * objectui#6939's claim is unaffected — ITS repair still moved the validator
 * and not the renderer; what moved the renderer was a different card, and
 * keeping a stale "before" here would only make the next reader hunt a
 * regression that is a deliberate, ruled repair.
