/**
 * A filter whose every key is SKIPPED must select the same rows on both
 * `find()` routes — objectui#9020.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `convertFiltersToAST` skips a key whose value is `null` / `undefined`. That is
 * this file's oldest documented behaviour and objectui#9020 did not touch it:
 * `{ a: null, s: 1 }` still lowers to `['s', '=', 1]`. But when EVERY key was
 * skipped, the general tail handed back the CALLER'S ORIGINAL OBJECT — and
 * `find()` has two routes to the server, which read that object differently:
 *
 * ```
 * plain  GET /data/account                        →  EVERY row
 * expand GET /data/account?populate=…&filter={"a":null}  →  the `a = null` rows
 * ```
 *
 * The plain route hands the value to `client.data.find`, whose non-AST branch
 * spreads a plain object's entries as query parameters and SKIPS the null ones,
 * so nothing at all was appended. The `$expand` / `$search` route
 * JSON-serialises the same object into `filter=`, and `{ a: null }` is a
 * well-formed `FilterCondition` — `null` is in the spec's
 * `ACCEPTED_FILTER_COMPARAND_TYPES` — so it arrived as a real predicate.
 *
 * ⭐ That last sentence is why triage graded this p2 and why the assertions
 * below are shaped the way they are: *"the deciding factor is unrelated to the
 * filter"*. A caller cannot predict which behaviour they get from the filter
 * alone, and **both routes look correct in isolation**. So the oracle is the
 * DISAGREEMENT between them, never a shape on either — a test that drove one
 * route and asserted a shape would go green on a repair that left the two
 * disagreeing differently.
 *
 * ## Why the assertions are shaped the way they are
 *
 * Every case is driven down BOTH routes and the two answers are compared with
 * each other before either is compared with a literal. Both halves are needed:
 *
 *   - agreement ALONE passes on two routes that agree on the wrong answer, so
 *     each case also names the row set it expects;
 *   - the row set alone cannot tell "honoured" from "dropped" for a filter whose
 *     correct answer is every row, so §0 proves the fixture can distinguish
 *     every-row from the `a = null` subset before any of it is read that way.
 *
 * The row sets are read through `ValueDataSource`'s matcher — the same AST/object
 * evaluator `@object-ui/core` ships — fed with exactly what each route put on the
 * wire, so "what the server would answer" is measured rather than asserted.
