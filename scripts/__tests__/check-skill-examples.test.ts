/**
 * objectui#7359 — the test for `scripts/check-skill-examples.mjs`.
 *
 * ## What this file covers, and what it deliberately leaves to `--self-test`
 *
 * Everything here runs on an UNBUILT tree: the fence scanner, the marker
 * convention, the JSON dialects, and the wiring. That boundary is not tidiness —
 * this suite runs inside `ci.yml`'s `Test (shard N/4)` jobs, which do not build
 * the workspace, and a test that needed `dist/*.d.ts` would either be flaky or
 * would quietly assert nothing there.
 *
 * The compiler half — a marked fence that holds up is clean, a marked fence with
 * a type error is red, an unparseable one is a SYNTAX failure and does not blind
 * the semantic phase for the rest — lives in the script's own `--self-test`,
 * which the workflow runs AFTER the build, and which refuses with
 * `PRECONDITION NOT MET` (exit 2) rather than skipping if the tree is not built.
 * `wiring` below pins that the workflow really runs it, because a probe nobody
 * runs is indistinguishable from a probe that passes.
 *
 * The fixtures are strings and throwaway trees, never the real guides: a
 * committed fixture guide would have to contain a deliberately broken example,
 * and something else in this repository would eventually scan it — the reasoning
 * `check-skills-paths.test.ts` states for its own trees.
