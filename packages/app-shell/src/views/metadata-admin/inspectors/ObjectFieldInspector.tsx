/**
 * ObjectFieldInspector — scoped editor for the selected Object field.
 *
 * Selection shape:  { kind: 'field', id: '<field_name>' }
 *
 * The inspector edits one field at a time. Sections:
 *   • Basic     — name (rename), label, type, required, unique, description
 *   • Specific  — picklist options / lookup target / formula / numeric
 *                 precision / max length, conditional on type
 *   • Advanced  — readonly, hidden, externalId, group
 *
 * All edits are applied as immutable splices of `draft.fields` via
 * the object-fields-io helpers, preserving the original array-vs-record
 * shape AND any unknown keys on the field definition — except the
 * spec-rejected keys `object-fields-io` strips on read
 * (`RETIRED_FIELD_KEYS`). The same holds one level down for a picklist
 * option: `readOptions` carries the keys the option editor has no control
 * for and `patchOptions` writes them back (objectui#7540), and an option the
 * editor cannot represent AT ALL is reported on its own row and written back
 * verbatim rather than shown blank and dropped (objectui#8632 — see
 * `classifyOption`).
 *
 * There is deliberately no `Indexed` control here (objectui#4644): the
 * spec has no field-level index flag, `FieldSchema.safeParse` rejects
 * `indexed` by name, and offering it only ever produced a 422 that blocked
 * the save. Object-level `indexes[]` is the real surface.
 *
 * Rename: changing the `name` rewrites the field's key in-place and
 * re-issues the selection so the inspector stays bound to the same
 * field. Other fields/options that reference the old name are NOT
 * auto-rewritten — callers should re-validate downstream.

/**
 * One row of the picklist option editor.
 *
 * `value` / `label` / `color` are the keys this editor DISPLAYS and owns — it
 * renders a control for each and is authoritative for their values. `rest`
 * carries every OTHER authored key of the same option verbatim, so a round
 * trip through this inspector is not lossy for keys it has no opinion about.
 * Today that is `default` and `visibleWhen`: both are ACCEPTED by
 * `SelectOptionSchema` and both are honoured by the platform (`default` is
 * ruled `enforce` on the object-field face, objectstack#7246 — the engine
 * seeds the insert path from the option holding it), yet neither had any way
 * to survive this editor before objectui#7540.
 *
 * Two properties of `rest` are load-bearing:
 *
 *   • It is EDITOR-INTERNAL and must never appear as a key of the WRITTEN
 *     option. `SelectOptionSchema` is strict (`unrecognized_keys` at
 *     `[options.<i>]` on `FieldSchema`), so leaking it would turn every save
 *     into a 422. `patchOptions` therefore spreads its CONTENTS and never
 *     spreads an `Option`.
 *   • The three parts move TOGETHER. Widening this type without moving both
 *     `readOptions` and `patchOptions` would declare keys the editor still
 *     cannot carry — the declared-but-not-carried divergence objectui#7014
 *     exists to remove.

/**
 * Why the reader stays STRICT — the ruling this function is the subject of.
 *
 * This reader used to open with `value: String(o?.value ?? '')`. That single
 * expression is consumer-side tolerance (AGENTS.md #0.1) and it produced BOTH
 * halves of objectui#8632, in two different directions, each measured on the
 * unfixed reader:
 *
 *   • It manufactured an empty value for every entry it could not read — a bare
 *     string, `null`, `5`, `true`, `{}`, `{ label }` with no `value`. The author
 *     saw a BLANK row: three authored options rendered as three empty boxes.
 *     Then `OptionsEditor.commit` — which persists only rows with a non-empty
 *     `value` — DELETED them. Measured trigger: one click on "Add value", with
 *     nothing typed, wrote `options: []` over three authored options.
 *   • It silently REWROTE every entry whose `value` it could stringify into
 *     something else: `{ value: 5 }` was written back as `"5"`, `{ value: true }`
 *     as `"true"`, `{ value: ['alpha'] }` as `"alpha"` (indistinguishable on
 *     screen from a well-formed option), `{ value: { a: 1 } }` as
 *     `"[object Object]"`. Same for the other two keys this editor owns:
 *     `label: 5` was written back as `label: ''`, and a non-string `color` was
 *     dropped from the document entirely.
 *
 * A repair that only caught the first family would have looked complete and
 * left the second one deleting authored content exactly as before, so the rule
 * here is one rule, not a list of shapes: an entry this editor cannot represent
 * FAITHFULLY is not represented. It is reported on its own row and carried
 * through verbatim, and the author removes or repairs it deliberately.
 *
 * Two boundaries this classifier deliberately does NOT cross, because both are
 * prior rulings in this file rather than oversights:
 *
 *   • A MISSING `label` is not malformed. `patchOptions` emits `label: ''` for
 *     it, which is the objectui#7014 Q2 ruling: `''` is what the Label box has
 *     been showing the author all along, and the spec accepts it. A present but
 *     non-string `label` is a different fact — there are authored bytes being
 *     destroyed — and that one IS malformed.
 *   • A `value` this editor can represent but the SPEC rejects (`'a'` — the
 *     select option's two-character minimum) stays an ordinary editable row.
 *     The author can see it and fix it in place, and the draft validator is the
 *     surface that names it. This reader reports only what it cannot show.

   * pattern-matching `entry.name` against the auto-generated placeholder
   * shapes (`field_<N>` / `<type>` / `<type>_<N>`) — and the first derivation
   * DESTROYS the very shape it gated on. Measured: typing `Health Score` one
   * key at a time renamed `field_10` -> `h` on the `H`, after which `h` no
   * longer looked auto-generated and every later keystroke was ignored. One
   * paste of the same string still worked, which is why a single-`change`
   * test never saw it.
   *
   * So RECORD the answer instead of re-deriving it from a string this feature
   * itself rewrites. Same posture the object/app create surfaces already use
   * (`CreateViewDialog`'s `nameTouched`, `useCreateDerive`'s touched set): the
   * derivation yields the moment the value has an authoritative source.
   *
   *   'label'  — this inspector wrote the name from the label; the next label
   *              change may move it again.
   *   'author' — the author typed the name into the API name box; nothing the
   *              label does moves it again. This is the third state the triage
   *              asked to be answered explicitly: an unconditional follow
   *              would silently erase what the author had just typed, which is
   *              worse than not syncing at all. It also covers the one case no
   *              string test can decide — a hand-typed `field_9` is the
   *              author's value, not `nextFieldName()`'s output.
   *
   * A name that arrived from the store (a saved field, e.g. `priority`) is in
   * NEITHER state: it matches no placeholder shape and carries no record, so
   * it is locked — #2260's "lock it on first save" boundary. The record is
   * per mounted inspector, so a reload always falls back to that check; what
