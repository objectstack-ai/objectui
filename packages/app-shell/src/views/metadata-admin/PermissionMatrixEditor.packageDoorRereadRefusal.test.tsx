/**
 * The package door REFUSES the save when its save-time fresh read REJECTS
 * (objectui#9420).
 *
 * ## The defect these pins reach
 *
 * `doSave`'s package-door arm documents an ADR-0086 P0 guarantee: merge only
 * this package's slice back onto a fresh read of the record, so rows
 * contributed by OTHER packages survive byte-for-byte. The fresh read used to
 * be `client.layered(...).catch(() => null)` with `base = fresh?.effective ??
 * payload`, and on the `.catch` arm the guarantee INVERTED: `payload` is the
 * editor's own draft, which the load path already sliced down to this
 * package's objects, so `mergePermissionSlice` had no out-of-scope rows left to
 * copy and the PUT deleted every other package's permission rows. 200, no
 * error, no warning, on a security surface.
 *
 * The card's one-shot probe on the real editor measured exactly that:
 * `saved.objects keys = ["a_account"]`, `saved.fields keys = []`,
 * `b_order present = false`.
 *
 * ## Why the pin drives the REAL editor and not `mergePermissionSlice`
 *
 * The three pins that existed when this file was written could not see this
 * defect, and the shape of each says why: `permission-slice.facetDrift.test.ts`
 * and `permission-slice.authoredKeys.test.ts` call `mergePermissionSlice`
 * directly with a real `base` — they never reach the fallback that CHOOSES the
 * base — and `PermissionMatrixEditor.packageDoorFacets.test.tsx` drives the
 * real `doSave` with `layered` resolving. The defect lives in the choice of
 * base, so a pin has to make that choice happen: real page, real `doSave`,
 * `layered` rejecting for the re-read.
 *
 * ## Why the absences below are readable
 *
 * "`client.save` was not called" is an absence, and an absence is worth nothing
 * without a control that can produce the presence. The resolving-arm test in
 * this file is that control: the same harness, the same edit, the same click —
 * only the re-read's answer differs — and it PUTs, with package B's rows
 * intact. The refusal test additionally asserts `layeredCalls === 2`, so the
 * empty `saved` cannot be a Save button that was never reached.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT refused
 *
 * A record the server does not hold answers the 404 shape, which
 * `MetadataClient.layered` resolves as `{ effective: null, … }` rather than
 * rejecting. That arm keeps the `?? payload` base: a set that exists only as a
 * package draft has no published rows for anyone to lose, and refusing there
 * would block the first save of every set created through the Studio Access
 * pillar's "+ New". Pinned here so the refusal cannot widen onto it by
 * accident.
 *
 * ## The second card in this file — the ENVIRONMENT door (objectui#9484)
 *
 * Same harness, opposite door, opposite ruling. At environment scope there is
 * no pre-save re-read; the `layered` call that rejects is the POST-save one
 * that re-anchors the display baseline, and by the time it runs the write has
 * already landed. Left bare it fell into `doSave`'s `catch`, which reported a
 * SUCCESSFUL permission write as an error, left `isDirty` true (so the
 * `beforeunload` guard kept firing on a persisted record) and skipped
 * `setDestructive(null)`. The two doors must NOT be unified: one refusal
 * protects a write that has not happened, the other would lie about a write
 * that has. The `ENVIRONMENT door is untouched` describe below pins what that
 * door WRITES; objectui#9484's describe pins what it then DISPLAYS.
