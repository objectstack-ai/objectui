/**
 * The form family's own feedback chrome, resolved through the locale packs
 * (objectui#11039): the success toast a form raises when the author declared
 * no `successMessage`, the note that rides it when a declared
 * `navigateOnSuccess` was refused, the thank-you panel's heading, the loading
 * line, the load-failure heading, and the default submit and cancel labels.
 *
 * These were English literals in `ObjectForm`, `TabbedForm`, `SplitForm` and
 * `MasterDetailForm`, so a zh session saw `Created`, `Loading form...` and
 * `Error loading form` beside a Chinese UI. Every one of them is a DEFAULT: an
 * authored `successMessage`, `submitText`, `cancelText` or thank-you `title`
 * still wins, exactly as before.
 *
 * `WizardForm`, `DrawerForm` and `ModalForm` already had a
 * `createSafeTranslation` hook of their own and carry the rows they need in
 * it; the rows are the same keys, and `pnpm check:i18n-keys` holds every table
 * to the `en` pack, so the copies cannot drift apart.

/**
 * What the submitter is told when a DECLARED `navigateOnSuccess` produced no
 * destination — objectui#5034 point 2.
 *
 * The write succeeded, so this rides on the success toast as a note rather than
 * becoming an error or a blocking panel: turning a successful write into an
 * error state would be a worse lie than the silence it replaces. What was
 * missing is one fact, and only one: the navigation the author declared did not
 * happen. Before this, the toast was byte-identical to the toast a form with no
 * `navigateOnSuccess` at all produces, so an author who mistyped the destination
 * — or whose record carried no usable id — saw a form that looked entirely
 * healthy and had silently stopped honouring a key they wrote.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-17: "A refused declared navigation is surfaced: the
 * success toast carries a note that the declared navigation was not performed —
 * never indistinguishable from the no-key case."
 *
 * The note names no REASON on purpose. `resolveSuccessNavigate` answers null for
 * two different causes (no usable id on the written record; a destination the
 * same-origin guard refused) and returns no discriminant, so a reason in this
 * copy could only be re-derived by reimplementing that helper's internals at the
 * call site — where it would drift from the helper, and would additionally bake
 * an acceptance rule into user-visible prose, which objectui#5034 has since
 * narrowed once already. The diagnosable detail — the template the author
 * actually wrote — goes to `console.warn` at each call site instead.
 *
 * The submitter sees it (it is the toast's description), so it is pack key
 * `form.navigateRefused` and each form renders `t('form.navigateRefused')`
 * (objectui#11039). This constant is that key's English default, read from the
 * table above so there is one spelling of it; `WizardForm` re-exports it,
 * because that is where it used to live and where its tests import it from.
 * Single-sourced so a wizard and a flat form cannot tell a submitter two
 * different things about one refusal; a test pins that they do not.
