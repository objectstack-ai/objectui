/**
 * The diagnostics that say out loud what `data-table` has always done silently
 * with a key the AUTHOR wrote.
 *
 * TWO questions, one channel. The file is named for the first because it came
 * first (objectui#6575); it was never limited to it.
 *
 *   1. `bind` was authored — and `data-table` does not read `bind` at all
 *      (objectui#6575, maintainer ruling 2026-08-27, option A: 「同意」).
 *   2. `data` was authored and is NOT an array — so the renderer dropped it to
 *      zero rows at `data-table.tsx`'s
 *      `Array.isArray(rawData) ? rawData : EMPTY_ROWS` (objectui#6665).
 *
 * They are deliberately two predicates asking two questions, not one widened
 * predicate. The nodes that trip #2 carry no `bind` AT ALL, so #6575 staying
 * silent on them is correct behaviour rather than a gap — the triage ruling on
 * objectui#6665 is explicit about that, and widening #6575's question would
 * have made its silence look like the defect. See {@link describeNonArrayData}.
 *
 * ## The first defect this names
 *
 * `bind` is the data-scope binding vocabulary: a path string resolved by
 * `useDataScope()`. `list`, `tree-view` and the `object-*` plugin widgets read
 * it. `DataTableRenderer` does NOT — it takes its rows from `data: rawData =
 * EMPTY_ROWS` off the node, and the file calls no such hook.
 *
 * A `bind` on a `data-table` is nevertheless accepted by every gate: the TS
 * side by `BaseSchema`'s `[key: string]: any`, the zod side by `BaseSchema`
 * being `.passthrough()` (which `DataTableSchema.extend(…)` inherits). So the
 * author gets a table drawing a correct-looking header over the "No results
 * found" empty state, with no error, no warning and no diagnostic — the
 * hardest failure shape for a human OR an AI author to self-check, because a
 * rendered header reads as a success receipt.
 *
 * The platform was already paying a teaching cost for it rather than a
 * diagnostic cost: `skills/objectui/rules/protocol.md` documents the pothole
 * verbatim, and `skill-guide-data-table-binding.test.tsx` pins the behaviour.
 * This module moves the warning from the docs to the console, where the author
 * who did not read the docs is standing.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It changes NO behaviour. `data-table` still does not read `bind`, and the
 * ruling is explicit that it must not start: making it a `useDataScope` reader
 * (option B) is a separate published-surface question needing its own ruling.
 * Refusing the key at parse (option C) stays blocked on the `.passthrough()`
 * ceiling (objectui#5155 / objectui#6269). So the trap stops being silent; it
 * does not stop being a trap.
 *
 * ⭐ The `data`-vs-`bind` PRECEDENCE half of that open question DISSOLVED at
 * objectui#9308 rather than being answered. While `useDataScope` walked the
 * injected adapter, `bind` and the node's own `data` were two spellings of one
 * idea — "where this table's rows come from" — and a reader of both would have
 * needed a rule. Since that ruling `bind` resolves a path in the ambient
 * predicate scope and `data` is an inline array on the node: different
 * channels, different questions, no precedence to decide. objectui#6575's
 * ruling that `data-table` must not read `bind` is untouched by that, and this
 * diagnostic's job is unchanged.
 *
 * ## Why a console warning, and only a console warning
 *
 * The same channel `plugin-grid`'s `columnSpellingDiagnostics.ts` uses for the
 * identical shape of failure ("you declared something and the renderer dropped
 * it"): a pure `describe…` function returning `string | null`, called from a
 * `useEffect` keyed on the schema slice, one `console.warn`, no NODE_ENV
 * branch. Deliberately the SAME shape rather than a second, differently-shaped
 * one next to it. Rendering an in-table message instead would be user-facing
 * copy needing all ten locale packs in `@object-ui/i18n`; a throw would take
 * the surrounding page down for a defect that costs one table.
 *
 * The rate limit is the `useEffect` key, and that is enough HERE for a reason
 * `visibilityDiagnostic.ts` does not have available: a node gate is evaluated
 * once per row, so it needs a module-level dedupe `Set` to keep one authoring
 * bug from printing N lines. A `data-table` is one node rendered once — the
 * effect key is one line per mount per distinct `bind`, which is already the
 * "one line per distinct authoring bug" ceiling that `Set` exists to buy.
 *
 * ## The message never asserts something it did not check
 *
 * A node can carry BOTH an inline `data` array and a `bind`. That table is not
 * empty, so the "header over an empty body" consequence would be false there —
 * and a diagnostic that overstates its own consequence teaches authors to
 * distrust it. The two cases get two different consequence clauses, decided by
 * looking at the rows the renderer actually resolved.

 *
 * ## Why this is not {@link hasAuthoredBind}'s question
 *
 * That one asks "was a `bind` authored?" — a key `data-table` does not read at
 * all. This asks about `data`, the key it genuinely does read, and asks a
 * SHAPE question about it rather than a presence one. The nodes that trip this
 * carry no `bind`, so #6575's predicate is correctly silent on them; that
 * silence is precisely why a second question had to be asked here instead of
 * the first one being widened.
 *
 * ## Why the predicate is not keyed on the `${...}` shape
 *
 * The expression string is the spelling that was REPORTED, but it is not the
 * defect. `Array.isArray(rawData) ? rawData : EMPTY_ROWS` swallows a number, an
 * object, a `null` and a plain string exactly as silently, so a predicate that
 * only caught `${...}` would leave the next non-array spelling to arrive as a
 * fresh card. The shape only chooses the wording (see {@link TEMPLATE_SHAPE}).

 * predicate, two readers.

/**
 * The message for a `data-table` node whose `data` is not an array, or `null`
 * when there is nothing to say.
 *
 * ## Why no measured-consequence clause, unlike {@link describeIgnoredBind}
 *
 * That one has to look at the rows the renderer resolved, because a node can
 * carry BOTH a `bind` and a real inline `data` array — "header over an empty
 * body" would be false there. Here it cannot be: `data` is the ONLY row source
 * `data-table` has, and this function is called exactly when that source is not
 * an array, so the body is `EMPTY_ROWS` by construction. The consequence is
 * stated because the predicate already established it, not asserted on faith.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT say
 *
 * It does not tell the author to move the expression under `properties`. The
 * same expression IS evaluated there — that contrast is what makes this a
 * defect rather than a design — but whether `properties` is an authoring
 * channel for the `ui:*` / `page:*` namespaces is an open contract question,
 * recorded in `skills/objectui/rules/protocol.md` rather than recommended by
 * it. A console line is the wrong place to settle that, so the message teaches
 * the one route the guides do teach: the host resolves the rows.
 *
 * It also changes NO behaviour. Making node-level `data` evaluate expressions
 * is a behaviour change on a published component; the objectui#6665 triage
 * ruling put that arm on the maintainer floor and dispatched only this one.
 * The trap stops being silent; it does not stop being a trap.
