/**
 * What an action is allowed to carry — objectstack#4075, all three steps.
 *
 * `ActionDef` used to end with `[key: string]: any`, so it accepted any key of
 * any type. Concretely (objectui#2990): deleting `ActionDef.execute` produced
 * ZERO compile errors even though the field had just been removed, and stale
 * metadata authoring `execute: 'markDone'` type-checked. The same deletion
 * against `@object-ui/types`' `ActionSchema` — which has no index signature —
 * correctly produced `TS2353` at the authoring site. One of the two readers
 * could catch a retired key; the other was structurally incapable.
 *
 * That asymmetry was the issue. An open key set on a DECLARED METADATA CONTRACT
 * is what lets a typo (`targt`, `exectue`) and a tombstoned key (`execute`) both
 * sail through to a runner that then silently does nothing — the #2169 "Mark
 * Done does nothing" shape.
 *
 * This module was step 1 of the staged narrowing: make the key set VISIBLE and
 * warn on anything outside it, without changing a single type. Step 2 promoted
 * the legitimate keys to explicit optional fields; **step 3 removed the index
 * signature**, so `tsc` now rejects a typo or a retired key outright.
 *
 * ── Why this module SURVIVES step 3 ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Step 1 wrote that the dev-mode warning "can retire" once the index signature
 * came down. Step 3 measured that and kept it, because the two mechanisms cover
 * DISJOINT populations rather than the same one twice:
 *
 *   - `tsc` sees action literals AUTHORED IN CODE. It rejects an unknown key at
 *     the construction site, which is the strongest possible signal — but only
 *     for actions that exist as TypeScript.
 *   - the warning below sees actions that arrive as DATA. objectstack#3903
 *     established that stored `sys_metadata` rows are rehydrated UNPARSED, so
 *     authored metadata reaches `runner.execute()` as a plain object no
 *     compiler ever looked at. That is the population `execute: 'markDone'`
 *     actually lives in, and no type can reach it.
 *
 * Retiring the warning would therefore have re-opened the runtime half of the
 * gap while closing the compile-time half — which is why `executeScript`'s
 * rename-prescription branch also survives, for the same rows and the same
 * reason. What DID retire with the index signature is the inverted pin in
 * `actionKeys.pin.test.ts` that asserted the signature was still there; it now
 * asserts the opposite, which was always its stated completion condition.
 *
 * The lists are pinned by `__tests__/actionKeys.pin.test.ts`, which re-derives
 * each one from its actual source. A hand-maintained list that drifts from the
 * interface it mirrors would be the same "declared ≠ enforced" trap this whole
 * thread is about.
 *
 * ── What the inventory found, and what step 2 did with it ────────────────────
 * Step 1 found `ActionDef` declaring 34 keys against the spec `ActionSchema`'s
 * 36, overlapping on 17. The two halves of the difference were different
 * problems, and step 2 (objectstack#4075) treated them differently:
 *
 * 18 keys the SPEC owns that `ActionDef` never declared — `ai`, `aria`,
 * `bodyExtra`, `bodyShape`, `bulkEnabled`, `component`, `icon`, `locations`,
 * `mode`, `objectName`, `order`, `recordIdField`, `recordIdParam`,
 * `requiredPermissions`, `requiresFeature`, `shortcut`, `variant`, `visible`.
 * These are authored today and used to reach readers through the index
 * signature. **Step 2 promoted all 18 to explicit optional fields**, typed by
 * DERIVATION from `@objectstack/spec`'s `ActionInput` rather than by hand-copied
 * shapes. The `as any` casts `ActionEngine` needed to read `visible`,
 * `locations` and `requiredPermissions` are gone with them — those casts existed
 * only because the fields were undeclared.
 *
 * Two of the 18 landed as `undefined` rather than as usable types, which is the
 * correct outcome: spec 17 retired `shortcut` and `bulkEnabled` as `retiredKey()`
 * tombstones (`z.never()`), so deriving turns "authoring this is a parse
 * rejection" into a compile error at no cost. Hand-copying would have quietly
 * re-legitimized two dead keys — which is why the types are derived.
 *
 * 16 keys `ActionDef` declares that the spec does not own — `actionType`, `api`,
 * `chain`, `chainMode`, `close`, `condition`, `confirm`, `endpoint`, `modal`,
 * `navigate`, `onClick`, `onFailure`, `redirect`, `reload`, `toast`,
 * `actionParams`. (`onSuccess` was the 17th until objectui#5934 retired the
 * runner's chained-callback meaning; the key is now spec-owned and derived,
 * like the 18 below.) Step 2 marked `@deprecated`, with the spec spelling to use
 * instead, ONLY the four the runner itself proves are aliases: `actionType` (→
 * `type`), `api` and `endpoint` (→ `target`; `executeAPI` resolves
 * `api || endpoint || target`), and `navigate` (→ flat `target`/`openIn`;
 * `executeNavigation` already falls back to them). The rest are runner mechanics
 * with no spec counterpart — chaining, toasts, post-execution reload/close — and
 * deprecating them toward a spelling that does not exist would be worse than
 * leaving them declared.
 *
 * ── What step 3 found the first two steps had missed ─────────────────────────
 * Deleting the index signature is the only thing that can name the keys still
 * hiding behind it, and it named five, in two groups:
 *
 * `to` / `external` / `newTab` / `replace` — the `navigation` alias's own
 * spelling. Step 1 had already ruled these legitimate and listed them below in
 * {@link NAVIGATION_ALIAS_KEYS}, but step 2's scope was the SPEC-owned keys, so
 * they were declared as data and never as fields; `executeNavigation` read them
 * through the index signature. Promoted, and deliberately not `@deprecated` —
 * step 2's acceptance ruled on exactly that point.
 *
 * `description` — objectui vocabulary from `@object-ui/types`' renderer view of
 * an action, forwarded by all four action renderers (`check:action-forward-parity`
 * requires it) and read by the param-collection dialog for its subtitle
 * (objectui#4192). Authorable, forwarded, read — and undeclared. These were the
 * only two `TS2353`s the deletion produced across the whole workspace.
 */

/**
 * Every property `ActionDef` declares, in declaration order.
 *
 * Kept as data because TypeScript types do not survive to runtime — `keyof
 * ActionDef` is erased along with the interface, so it cannot hand a runtime
 * classifier a list of anything. `actionKeys.pin.test.ts` re-derives this one
 * from the interface's AST, which is what keeps the data true.

 * Keys a HOST composes on the DISPATCH OBJECT at dispatch time — chrome the

 * no store ever holds.
 *
 * Distinct from every other list in this module, and the distinction is the
 * whole point: each of the three lists above restates one AUTHORED surface —
 * what `ActionDef` itself declares, what the spec's `ActionSchema` declares,
 * and the `navigation` alias's objectui dialect — so a key joining one of them
 * is a key an author may legally write. This list claims no such derivation and
 * must not acquire one: a key here is the opposite, and writing it in metadata
 * is still a compile error that must stay one. Maintainer ruling
 * 2026-08-22 fixes both halves of that: ⛔ the key is NOT declared on
 * `ActionDef` and ⛔ NOT added to {@link ACTION_DEF_KEYS}; it is declared at the
 * seam, on `packages/app-shell/src/consoleActionDispatch.ts`'s
 * `ConsoleActionDispatch`, and appears HERE only so the dev-mode warning below
 * stops calling it unknown.
 *
 * Why the warning has to know: `classifyActionKeys` sees the object the runner
 * was handed, which is the DISPATCH, not the stored metadata row. With the key
 * absent from the inventory, `warnOnUnknownActionKeys` told the author that a
 * key TWO files read is one "no reader recognizes", and prescribed promoting it
 * to `ActionDef` — the one shape the ruling forbids for it. A diagnostic that
 * fires on the product's own privileged path is how a console gets muted.
 *
 * {@link HOST_STASHED_PARAM_KEYS} below is the same category one level down —
 * host-composed keys inside `params` rather than on the action itself — and
 * cites `DeclaredActionsBar` by name for the same reason this does. Two lists
 * because the two warnings ask different questions of different objects, not
 * because the categories differ.
 *
 * `overrideNotice` — the privileged-override safety copy (objectui#5178),
 * naming the approvers about to be bypassed.
 * - producer: `packages/app-shell/src/views/DeclaredActionsBar.tsx`, on the
 *   `can_act:false && can_override:true` branch.
 * - readers: `packages/app-shell/src/hooks/useConsoleActionRuntime.tsx` and
 *   `packages/app-shell/src/views/RecordDetailView.tsx`, the console's two
 *   param-collection handlers, which render it ahead of the declared
 *   description in the dialog's subtitle.
 *
 * Anything added here must satisfy all three of: composed by a host in code,
 * never read back out of stored metadata, and read by the runtime. A key an
 * AUTHOR is meant to write belongs on `ActionDef` — or, when the spec owns it,
 * in `@objectstack/spec` first — and not in this list. `actionKeys.pin.test.ts`
 * pins the contents exactly, so growing the set is a deliberate, reviewed edit
