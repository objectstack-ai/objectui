/**
 * Home's metadata-authoring CTAs are gated on the SERVER's capability answer
 * (objectstack#8270).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * On the EE single-database multi-tenant deployment a workspace owner holds
 * `org_owner` + `organization_admin` but NOT `manage_metadata`. `HomePage`
 * gated its builder cover on `useWorkspaceAdminStatus()`, which reads the session's
 * POSITIONS (spelled `roles` until framework ADR-0090 D3 renamed it; see
 * objectui#5389) and finds `org_owner` there — so that owner saw "Build an app"
 * as the most prominent thing on their home page,
 * followed it into `/studio`, filled in the new-package dialog, and got a raw
 * English capability refusal at submit.
 *
 * The maintainer ruled (2026-08-13) that the missing grant is INTENDED — hosted
 * tenants do not author metadata — so the fix is presentational: the authoring
 * entry points are withheld with a visible, localized reason instead of leading
 * into a refusal.
 *
 * ## Why this file drives the REAL provider
 *
 * The ruling requires the gate to *consume the server's answer* rather than
 * re-derive permission logic client-side. Mocking `usePermissions` would assert
 * against a hand-written stand-in for that derivation and prove nothing about
 * it, so these cases mount the real `MePermissionsProvider` over the real
 * `/me/permissions` payload shape (`initialPermissions`, the provider's own
 * test/SSR seam) and let the genuine `systemPermissions` → `hasCapabilities`
 * path run. The payload in `eePayload` is the one recorded on the issue.
 *
 * ## Why `t` returns «key»
 *
 * The reason copy must resolve THROUGH i18n — an untranslated English sentence
 * at the point of refusal is half of what the card is about. A `t` that echoed
 * `defaultValue` would render identical text whether or not the key were wired,
 * so it echoes the KEY instead: an assertion on `«home.build.noCapability»`
 * fails if the string is ever hardcoded. That the key exists in all ten packs,
 * and that the call site's inline default matches `en`, is enforced separately
 * and mechanically by `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` and `check:i18n-keys`.

/* ── The `_drafts` double (objectui#7307) ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Every render of `HomePage` below mounts `PendingDraftsBanner`, which reads the
 * env-wide pending-draft count through `usePendingDrafts({})`. That hook fetches
 * `GET /api/v1/meta/_drafts` with the GLOBAL `fetch` — `usePendingDrafts.ts:48`,
 * no `apiFetch` seam anywhere on the path — from its mount effect
 * (`usePendingDrafts.ts:116` via `refresh` at `:94`). Under happy-dom that global
 * is a real HTTP client and the document URL defaults to `http://localhost:3000`,
 * so the relative path resolved to a live socket, once per case. The hook's read
 * is best-effort (its `catch` leaves `count` at `null`), which is why these cases
 * stayed green while the request always failed.
 *
 * Answered from a RECORDING double — the shape objectui#5225 settled on, carried
 * by `packages/plugin-report/src/__tests__/DatasetReportRenderer.test.tsx` and by
 * this burn-down's earlier batches. Deliberately NOT a blanket network stub: it
 * records every URL it is handed and `afterEach` fails on any URL outside the set
 * it serves, so an escape to somewhere else reds here instead of vanishing into
 * that `catch`.
 *
 * What it answers, and why that changes no assertion here: a known-EMPTY draft
 * ledger, in the `{ drafts: [...] }` envelope `fetchPendingDrafts` reads (the one
 * `MetadataClient.listDrafts` pins for this endpoint; the bare-array and
 * `{ data: { drafts } }` shapes parse to the same rows). Empty rather than seeded
 * is load-bearing: `PendingDraftsBanner` renders `null` when `(count ?? 0) <= 0`,
 * and the failing request produced `count === null` — so an empty ledger yields
 * byte-identical output to what these cases have always rendered, while a seeded
 * one would add a banner and a `pending-drafts-publish` button to every case's
 * tree. Routes are matched on the PATHNAME because the hook appends a
 * `?packageId=` scope for package-bound callers; the full URL is what gets
 * recorded.
