/**
 * objectui#9830 — a predicate whose string arm sits one `anyOf` DEEPER reaches
 * the condition builder, and the husk that means "nothing derived" still does
 * not.
 *
 * ## The defect, and why a flat pin never saw it
 *
 * `detectConditionWidget` gated on a ONE-LEVEL scan of `anyOf`
 * (`schema.anyOf.some(b => b.type === 'string')`). Every pin that exercised it
 * declared its predicate key as a bare `type: 'string'` or as a FLAT
 * `anyOf: [string, …]`, so all of them were green throughout — the shape the
 * platform actually serves for a predicate that ALSO accepts a boolean literal
 * was never in any fixture.
 *
 * ## Where the fixtures below come from — re-derivable, not invented
 *
 * Both predicate shapes are the real derivation of the installed
 * `@objectstack/spec`, through the same `z.toJSONSchema` call `/meta/types` is
 * served with. To reproduce either one:
 *
 * ```js
 * import * as z from 'zod';
 * import '@objectstack/spec';
 * import { getMetadataTypeSchema } from '@objectstack/spec/kernel';
 * const doc = z.toJSONSchema(getMetadataTypeSchema('action'),
 *                            { unrepresentable: 'any', io: 'input' });
 * doc.properties.visible               // NESTED — the subject
 * doc.properties.params.items.properties.visible   // FLAT — the control
 * ```
 *
 * `action`'s OWN `visible` wraps the CEL union inside a second union so a plain
 * `true` / `false` literal is also accepted; its `params[].visible` does not.
 * One product, one key name, two nesting depths — which is what makes the flat
 * arm below a control rather than a second copy of the subject.
 *
 * ## What this file pins
 *
 *  1. the NESTED predicate renders the condition builder — the arm that was
 *     dark, asserted through the face that renders and scoped to that field's
 *     own label id, not through a widget name or a source-text read;
 *  2. the FLAT predicate renders the SAME face in the SAME render — it was
 *     green before this change and must stay green, so case 1 cannot be read as
 *     a builder that now mounts on anything;
 *  3. ⛔ the HUSK — `anyOf: [ {}, {…envelope} ]`, what the output-mode
 *     derivation emits for `hook.condition`, `sharing_rule.condition` and
 *     `field.visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` — still gets NO
 *     builder. `{}` is JSON Schema for "anything", and it is equally what "this
 *     transform erased its own input type" looks like on the wire; reading it
 *     as a string arm would mount a CEL builder on a genuinely boolean-only key.
 *     That half of objectui#9830 needs a signal only the DECLARATION side can
 *     send and is reported, ⛔ not guessed here;
 *  4. a predicate-NAMED key is still required: a plain `label` string keeps its
 *     text input, so the shape gate is not doing the naming's job either.
 *
 * ⚠️ Case 3 is the one that makes this a pin rather than a ratchet: widen the
 * gate to treat `{}` as a string arm and it goes red, which is the intended
 * alarm and ⛔ not a test to relax.
