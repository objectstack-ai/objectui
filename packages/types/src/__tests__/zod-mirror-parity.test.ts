/**
 * Every hand-written zod mirror in `../zod/` accepts everything its TypeScript
 * declaration declares (objectui#5684).
 *
 * ## The class
 *
 * A mirror restates a TS declaration by hand. When the declaration widens and the
 * mirror does not follow, the result is `declared !== enforced` on a PUBLISHED
 * surface (`@object-ui/types/zod`): the validator refuses a spelling the published
 * types invite and the renderer implements. Two instances were found
 * independently before anything looked for them —
 *
 *   - objectui#4605 (fixed in #5680): `BaseSchema`'s mirror had drifted narrow on
 *     FIVE keys, three of which the card naming it did not know about.
 *   - objectui#5186: `FieldValidationRules`' mirror refused the object dialect the
 *     TS contract declares and admitted a flat one no read point consumed.
 *
 * Both are regression evidence here, not open questions.
 *
 * ## The construction, and why it is derived
 *
 * #5680 established the shape and this file generalises it unchanged: read the
 * mirror's OWN `.shape` and compare each key against the declaration, so the next
 * widening that forgets a mirror turns red WITH NO KEY LIST TO MAINTAIN. A
 * hand-written key list is the same artefact the drift keeps producing.
 *
 * It reads `.shape` and not `keyof z.input<typeof Mirror>` because that spelling is
 * vacuous — `.passthrough()` collapses the inferred key union to bare `string`.
 * `assertionNoVacuousEntry` below pins that for every registered entry at once.
 *
 * ## What is registered
 *
 * `MIRRORS` pairs a mirror with the declaration it restates. The PAIRING is the
 * only hand-maintained part; the key census under it stays derived. Pairing by
 * name alone is not safe — the const named `FieldConstraintsSchema` mirrors
 * `FieldValidationRules`, NOT the like-named legacy `FieldConstraints` in
 * `../field-types.ts` (the flat dialect #5186 removed), and a name-derived pairing
 * reports five drifted keys that do not exist.
 *
 * `EXCLUSIONS` carries every other exported const in `../zod/` WITH ITS REASON, and
 * the runtime census at the bottom asserts the two together account for every one
 * of them. That is what keeps the population honest: a new mirror added to the
 * directory fails this file until someone registers or excludes it, so an
 * incomplete population reads as a declared decision instead of an oversight.
 *
 * ## The population, and where each number came from (objectui#6141)
 *
 * ⚠️ Every count in this header is READ, not inherited. The three that used to
 * stand here — "163 pairs" twice and "13 entries" once — were stale, and they were
 * the numbers other cards quoted as the size of the drift problem (objectui#5927's
 * framing, and objectui#6058's own dispatch, both inherited "163").
 *
 * ⚠️ READ is not the same as CHECKED, and the gap between them is where this header
 * rots: a figure read once becomes prose the moment it is written down. The three
 * LEDGER ENTRY counts below — and the ratchet section's restatement of the first of
 * them — are compared to the ledgers they describe by 'the ledger entry counts the
 * header states are derived, not prose' at the bottom of this file (objectui#7733),
 * so an entry added or removed fails this file instead of leaving a stale digit
 * standing. Their KEY totals, and the cross-ledger figures beside them, are
 * compared the same way by 'the header key totals and cross-ledger figures are
 * derived, not prose' (objectui#8222) — that pin was filed because `KnownDrift`'s
 * key total had been one low since objectui#7664 while the file stayed green.
 *
 * ⭐ **Every LIVE figure in this header is now pinned or explicitly excluded**, and
 * that is the state to preserve. A figure here is LIVE when it describes the file as
 * it is now, so it rots when the file moves; the many figures that name a reading at
 * a NAMED PAST revision ("42 / 63 until objectui#7542 …", "121 when objectui#6058
 * seeded it") are historical and cannot rot — they are readings of a tree that is
 * fixed. Exactly one figure is excluded rather than pinned, and it says so where it
 * stands: the seed decomposition under `UnmirroredDeclared`, which needs a
 * key's PROVENANCE and no ledger in this file records that. ⚠️ It was LIVE when that
 * exclusion was written and is HISTORICAL now — objectui#8243 anchored the statement
 * at named revisions — so it is no longer an exception to the sentence above, and
 * ⛔ the exclusion is not licence to pin or refresh it (objectui#8248). ⛔ Do not add
 * a live figure here without a pin, and ⛔ do not pin one by writing a second constant —
 * every pin below reads the header's OWN spelling, so the count a human edits stays
 * exactly one per site (objectui#7733's principle, and objectui#7433's before it).
 *
 * ⭐ **The LIVE / HISTORICAL split governs this file's ASSERTION MESSAGES too**
 * (objectui#8248; maintainer ruling, decision batch #71). Judge a message CLAUSE, not
 * a whole message:
 *
 *   - a clause that RECORDS A MEASUREMENT ("we measured X at revision R", "the header
 *     carries no copy") is HISTORICAL — ⛔ never rewritten by a later card, because
 *     rewriting it erases what was true when it was written;
 *   - a clause that GIVES GUIDANCE ("do Y next", "⛔ do not add Z", "this figure is
 *     live") is LIVE — it must be true NOW, and a later card MAY and MUST amend it
 *     when the world moves under it, citing the card that moved it.
 *
 * ⛔ Neither licence extends to the other half: amend the guidance clause, leave the
 * record clauses byte-identical beside it, and name the card that moved the world.
 * Guidance that has gone stale is the exact failure this file exists to catch, and it
 * misleads toward DOING work — a reader told a historical figure is "live" goes off to
 * pin or exclude it. The first application is objectui#8248's amendment to
 * objectui#8222's exclusion note, at the bottom of this file.
 *
 * On a file whose entire subject is measurement that is worth stating explicitly:
 *
 *   - **the pair population** — `Object.keys(MIRRORS).length`, pinned to the single
 *     written-down constant `EXPECTED_MIRROR_PAIRS` by the runtime census at the
 *     bottom of this file (objectui#7433); `assertionRegistryHalvesAgree` already pins
 *     it equal to `keyof Declared`. ⛔ Read the constant, not this sentence — a digit
 *     here is the artefact that rotted four times. 159 until objectui#7068 RETIRED the
 *     `crud.zod.ts#ActionCallbackSchema` pair — the const and its `ActionCallback`
 *     declaration both DELETED (the objectui#7664 route for a standalone retired pair;
 *     the legacy `ActionSchema.onSuccess` / `onFailure` keys that carried it are `never`
 *     / `retirementTombstone()` on the two faces), a pair with no entry in any ledger,
 *     so no other count moved; 157 until objectui#7664 retired the
 *     three `DeclarativeKanban*` pairs and registered the five plugin-dialect ones
 *     (`KanbanCardSchema`, `KanbanColumnSchema`, `KanbanSchema`, `CardTemplateSchema`,
 *     `ColumnWidthConfigSchema` — the `'kanban'` arm rewritten to the shape the
 *     registered renderer reads, ruling (a)); 155 until objectui#7655 registered the
 *     `ChatbotEnhancedSchema` and `ChatbotFloatingSchema` twins; 154 until objectui#7352
 *     registered `data-display.zod.ts#DrillDownConfigSchema` — a nested config mirror
 *     paired with the local `DrillDownConfig`, the `ObjectMapConfigSchema` precedent —
 *     which carries no ledger entry. ⚠️ **This line rotted twice and was re-derived at
 *     objectui#7352 contract review** (objectui#7655's contract review measured the same
 *     rot independently: three instruments read 154 where the prose said 160). Its
 *     history, measured by running the same walk over this file at each revision
 *     rather than by reading the prose: `4ca30d044` wrote "160" when `MIRRORS` held
 *     **163**; `d88e20f55` (objectui#7432) took the registry to **154** without touching
 *     the sentence; objectui#7352 then added its 1 to the stale baseline and wrote 161.
 *     Two independent derivations agreed on the figure the constant now carries — a
 *     TypeScript AST walk counting
 *     `PropertyAssignment` nodes in the `MIRRORS` initializer, and a line-oriented parse
 *     of the same block — and they agree on the historical figures above. ⛔ Do not add
 *     a delta to this number; count the registry. Nothing asserts it against a written
 *     one, so this line is prose and can rot; the pin that cannot is the one
 *     comparing the two halves to each other.
 *   - **41 entries** in `KnownDrift`, **63 keys** across them — 40 / 61 until
 *     objectui#7804 DECLARED `objectql.zod.ts#ObjectKanbanSchema`'s
 *     `onCardClick` and `onQuickAdd` (director seat, decision batch #69), a new
 *     entry carrying TWO of the three keys the retirement below stranded on the
 *     surviving face. ⭐ The first entry this ledger has gained from an arm
 *     RETIREMENT leaving reads behind on a sibling: the keys did not move and
 *     no face drifted — the face that used to declare them stopped existing,
 *     and a different one picked up the obligation. ⚠️ TWO of the three, not
 *     three: `onCardMove` is measured `'retired'` on this face and
 *     `check:handler-key-reads` refuses that spelling while the renderer still
 *     reads the key, so neither face declares it and it is not drift at all.
 *     It was 40 / 61 until then, because
 *     objectui#8802 RETIRED the bare `kanban` node type key (maintainer ruling
 *     2026-09-09) and the `complex.zod.ts#KanbanSchema` pair with it, taking that
 *     entry's three RUNTIME SLOT keys (`onCardMove` / `onCardClick` /
 *     `onQuickAdd`) out of the ledger — ⭐ the first entry this ledger has lost by
 *     retiring a whole ARM rather than a key: the pair's TYPE LITERAL went, so a
 *     `{ "type": "kanban" }` document is refused before any member is compared.
 *     It was 41 / 64 until then, and 41 / 63 until
 *     objectui#8344 added `component` to `complex.zod.ts#DashboardWidgetSchema`, an
 *     existing entry (so the entry count did not move). 42 / 64 until
 *     objectui#8338 RETIRED the `feedback.zod.ts#ToastSchema` key on BOTH faces
 *     (ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove: `?: never` on the declaration, `retirementTombstone()`
 *     on the mirror), the entry's whole content, so the entry went with it. ⭐ The first
 *     entry this ledger has lost by RETIRING the key rather than by moving either face
 *     toward the other — and the only route open: the declaration had NO inhabitant to
 *     preserve, so "make the faces agree" had no mechanical direction. It was 41 / 63 until
 *     objectui#7760 SEEDED `feedback.zod.ts#ToastSchema` with its one key `action`
 *     (a pair born ledgered, not growth on an existing entry). ⭐ The first entry this
 *     ledger has gained from a face becoming READABLE rather than from a mirror or a
 *     declaration moving: the key's mirror face was `unknown` — which fits every
 *     declaration — until that card gave `SchemaNodeSchema` its input type argument.
 *     41 / 62 until
 *     objectui#7664 RE-KEYED the `kanban` arm (ruling (a)): the retired
 *     `DeclarativeKanbanSchema` entry carried `onCardMove` / `onCardClick`, and the
 *     plugin-dialect `KanbanSchema` entry that replaced it carries `onQuickAdd` as
 *     well — ONE ENTRY OUT, ONE IN, so the entry count did not move and the key
 *     total did. ⚠️ That is why this figure stood one low and fully green for four
 *     commits: the pin of the day (objectui#7733) read the entry count beside it,
 *     and the number that actually moved had nothing looking at it. objectui#8222
 *     measured it with two instruments and bisected it to this commit; the key
 *     totals are pinned from objectui#8222 onward. 42 / 63 until
 *     objectui#7542 REPAIRED `app.zod.ts#AppComponentSchema`'s one key `hidden` by
 *     restating the DECLARATION (`app.ts` now says `boolean`, what the spec-derived
 *     mirror enforced all along), the entry's whole content, so the entry went too —
 *     the ledger's first shrink on a SPEC-DERIVED pair, and the first by moving the
 *     declared face toward the mirror rather than the mirror toward the declaration;
 *     40 / 57 until
 *     objectui#7655 SEEDED the `ChatbotEnhancedSchema` and `ChatbotFloatingSchema` pairs
 *     with three runtime-slot refusals each (pairs born ledgered in the #6124 shape,
 *     not growth on an existing entry); 40 / 56 until
 *     objectui#7104 declared `AlertDialogSchema.onAction`, the action button's
 *     `onClick` the renderer had been reading UNDECLARED, as a RUNTIME SLOT on an
 *     already-ledgered pair (growth on an existing entry, both faces measured);
 *     39 / 55 until
 *     objectui#7455 SEEDED `app.zod.ts#AppComponentSchema` with its one
 *     spec-derived key `hidden` (a pair born ledgered, not growth on an existing
 *     entry: both faces read `boolean` until the base was widened, and only the
 *     DECLARED face moved — the entry objectui#7542 removed, above). It stood at 39 / 55 rather than
 *     39 / 56 because objectui#6940
 *     REPAIRED `DataTableSchema.rowActions` (the entry kept its other four keys, so
 *     the entry count did not move). It was 12 / 17 until
 *     objectui#6124 added the RUNTIME-SLOT class (28 pairs touched, 35 keys) — see
 *     the class note inside the ledger, above `ButtonSchema` — 36 / 52 until
 *     objectui#6576 minted `ObjectDataTableSchema` with one such arm (`onRowClick`),
 *     and 37 / 53 until objectui#7344 swept the string / `z.any()` handler mirrors:
 *     `DetailSchema` and `DetailViewSchema` entered (one `onBack` each) and
 *     `CalendarViewSchema` grew by `onEventClick`.
 *   - **14 entries** in `UnmirroredDeclared`, **86 keys** across them — 14 / 87 until
 *     objectui#7762 MIRRORED `ObjectGridSchema.exportOptions` (the entry kept its other
 *     fourteen keys, so the entry count held); 14 / 96 until
 *     objectui#7779 closed nine of `ObjectViewSchema`'s ten keys (maintainer ruling
 *     B, 2026-09-06): eight MIRRORED — `navigation`, `searchableFields`,
 *     `filterableFields` by reference to the spec's `ListViewSchema` slots,
 *     `allowCreateView` / `viewActions` by reference to the sibling
 *     `ViewSwitcherSchema` slots the renderer forwards them into, `defaultViewType`
 *     / `defaultListView` / `showViewSwitcher` as local literals after a reader
 *     census — and `viewTabBar` RETIRED (tombstoned on both faces, zero reads). The
 *     entry KEPT `listViews` on the ruling's own fallback clause (its two value types
 *     measured incompatible), so the entry count held and only the keys moved; the
 *     spec reference also moved the entry between the split's halves — see the
 *     split below. 13 / 94 until
 *     objectui#7655 SEEDED a `ChatbotFloatingSchema` entry with `displayMode` and
 *     `floatingConfig`, the two keys that face declares alongside `ChatbotSchema`
 *     (whose own entry keeps all three of its keys — a pair born ledgered, not a
 *     move); 15 / 96 until objectui#7352 MIRRORED both `drillDown` rows at once
 *     (`ChartSchema` and `ObjectDataTableSchema`, each the entry's whole content, so
 *     both entries went): the ledger's second and third shrink by REPAIR, on the route
 *     objectui#6639 opened. It read 17 / 98
 *     between objectui#6576, which SEEDED the new `ObjectDataTableSchema` pair with its
 *     one measured key `drillDown` (a pair born ledgered, not growth on an existing
 *     one), and objectui#7129, which RETIRED `DetailViewSectionSchema.hideEmpty` —
 *     the ledger's first shrink by removing the DECLARATION rather than by mirroring
 *     it, and the entry's whole content, so the entry went too. objectui#7623 took
 *     that route a second time for `DashboardComponentSchema.title` (16 / 97 →
 *     15 / 96), again the entry's whole content — and the first time it reached the
 *     SPEC-DERIVED half. ⚠️ It was
 *     **121** when objectui#6058 seeded it; objectui#6152 moved 23 callback-shaped
 *     keys to the ledger below by RECLASSIFICATION, not by fixing them, and
 *     objectui#6639 MIRRORED `ObjectGridSchema.title` — one key actually repaired.
 *     Anything citing "121" as the mirroring debt is citing a number that changed
 *     meaning. ⛔ **EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM THE PINS, and not restated here as
 *     digits** (objectui#8222): the comparable decomposition is survivors + mirrored
 *     + retired + reclassified, and every term but the last needs each key's
 *     PROVENANCE — which of today's keys descend from the seed. No ledger in this
 *     file records provenance; they record entry → key set as it stands. So no
 *     instrument here can derive this figure, and a copy of it in this header could
 *     only be prose. ⚠️ The copy that stood here WAS prose and had rotted: it read
 *     "95 + 1 mirrored + 2 retired + 23 reclassified", a survivor count that stopped
 *     being true when objectui#7352 and objectui#7779 closed keys out of the ledger.
 *     objectui#8222 measured that it had (⛔ do NOT read 95 against today's 87 — the
 *     two count different things: 87 is the ledger total, and two of those keys were
 *     seeded long after the 121). It is ⛔ not replaced with a fresh digit, for the
 *     reason above. The full statement is on that ledger, which owns it — read it
 *     there, and ⛔ do not copy it back.
 *   - **7 entries** in `RuntimeOnlyDeclared`, **24 keys** across them.
 *     **6 of the 7** are a subset of the **14** pairs above; `TreeViewSchema` is
 *     NOT — it is the first pair whose ONLY ledger entry is a runtime-only one
 *     (objectui#6150 declared `onNodeClick` on an otherwise clean pair), which is why
 *     the union of the two unmirrored ledgers is **15** pairs and not **14**.
 *     ⚠️ Four live figures sit in those two sentences and all four are pinned: the
 *     `6` (a quantity of its own — how many entries the two unmirrored ledgers
 *     share), and three RESTATEMENTS — the `7` beside it, and the `14` twice — of
 *     counts already stated above. The `6` and the `7` were spelled as English WORDS
 *     until objectui#8222, which is why no instrument had ever read them: a figure
 *     spelled "six" rots exactly as fast as one spelled `6`, it is just harder to
 *     point a regex at. ⛔ Do not spell a live figure out again, and ⛔ do not
 *     restate one without checking that the pin's spelling still reaches it.
 *   - **22 entries** in `WiderThanDeclared`, **35 keys** across them, and **45 arms**
 *     under those keys — split **6** SCHEMA-NODE, **29** CONCRETE, **0** MIXED, **10** unions.
 *     ⭐ objectui#8517 taught the operator to tell an OPEN record — `z.record(z.string(), V)`
 *     — from a partial record over a finite key union, and NOT ONE figure on this line moved
 *     with it. ⛔ Do not read that as the clause measuring nothing. It was built on two live
 *     keys, `layout.zod.ts#GridSchema::columns` and
 *     `reports.zod.ts#ReportComponentSchema::exportConfigs`, and reported BOTH at that card's
 *     base (`3f775eeb8`); objectui#8516 / objectui#8556 then narrowed both MIRRORS to
 *     `z.partialRecord` (`d4733f27e`, PR #8573) while the card was in review, so on the tree it
 *     landed on (`main` at `7bf133d58`) the two faces agree and the operator reports neither.
 *     Both readings are of FIXED trees and ⛔ neither can rot. ⇒ Every earlier reading of this
 *     ledger, objectui#7759's census included, was a FLOOR for the open-record shape and not a
 *     count; the two keys it was short are closed at the MIRROR instead of ledgered here. ⛔ Do
 *     not delete the clause as unused: it is what makes a re-widening of either mirror fail
 *     HERE, which is the file-level instrument objectui#8556 ruled that repair had to be
 *     pinned against rather than against an accept set alone. Its discrimination is pinned on
 *     synthetics at `assertionOpenRecordWideningIsReported`, with the `.passthrough()`
 *     caricature beside it.
 *     (objectui#8252 built the arm split; objectui#7760 moved every figure in it.) It
 *     read 23 / 36 / 47 — 6 / 30 / 0 / 11 — until objectui#8338 RETIRED
 *     `feedback.zod.ts#ToastSchema::action`, the entry's whole content, so the entry, its
 *     one key and BOTH its arms left together. ⚠️ Six figures moved on one key, and NOT
 *     in step: CONCRETE counts KEYS and fell by 1 while `arms` fell by 2 — ⛔ do not step
 *     these by hand, the derivation reads arms and keys through different reducers and a
 *     hand-stepped CONCRETE was wrong by one when this was written. It
 *     read 34 / 52 / 61 — 24 / 27 / 1 / 9 — until objectui#7760 gave seven of the ten
 *     recursion-breaking mirrors their existing TypeScript declaration as an explicit
 *     INPUT type argument. ⛔ That repaired no mirror and no declaration: it made a face
 *     READABLE that had been `unknown`. 19 keys across **18** pairs LEFT
 *     (**13 emptied + 5 reduced = 18**) because the reading they recorded was the
 *     annotation, and 3 keys
 *     ENTERED — `feedback.zod.ts#ToastSchema::action` (⚠️ history: that row is GONE,
 *     retired by objectui#8338 above — ⛔ do not look for it below),
 *     `navigation.zod.ts#HeaderBarSchema::logo`, `overlay.zod.ts#TooltipSchema::content`
 *     — real widenings the erased face had been HIDING. ⚠️ **pairs** there counts every
 *     entry the move TOUCHED — an entry that lost a key and KEPT others is still one it
 *     moved — and `emptied` is the subset that lost its whole content. Both readings are
 *     written down because a bare pairs figure had already forked: this line read `16`,
 *     which is NEITHER of the two readings above — ⛔ and they are not restated here as
 *     digits, because a restatement no pin reaches is the objectui#7733 shape one line
 *     further in. It was the one figure in this paragraph no pin reached, while every
 *     other one moved correctly with objectui#7760.
 *     objectui#8458 re-derived it by running this file's own `ledgerEntryMembers` over
 *     `WiderThanDeclared` at `645ecb98c` and `a480f797a` — PR #8354's parent and its
 *     merge — and diffing entry → key pairs; the decomposition is pinned by 'the
 *     objectui#7760 movement figures reconcile with themselves' at the bottom of this
 *     file. ⛔ That pin reads this sentence and nothing else: the movement is a
 *     HISTORICAL reading of two fixed trees, and pointing it at the live ledger is the
 *     hand re-derivation objectui#8243 removed. ⭐ All three are the
 *     `z.union([SchemaNodeSchema, z.array(SchemaNodeSchema)])` single-or-list spelling
 *     objectui#7069 called systematic and could not judge, which is the whole reason
 *     that card's ledger declared this region EXCLUDED. MIXED is 0 because its one
 *     member is among the 19. ⚠️ Until #8252
 *     this ledger had NO figure in this header, and it is the one other cards quote as
 *     the size of the wider direction: objectui#7759 published its two halves as
 *     "27 keys / 21 pairs" SCHEMA-NODE and "27 keys / 18 pairs" CONCRETE, and
 *     objectui#8252's own card body inherited the first 27. Re-derived here the
 *     SCHEMA-NODE half is 24 pure plus the 1 MIXED — the figure had rotted by two while
 *     every pin in this file stayed green, which is the objectui#8222 shape on the one
 *     ledger objectui#8222 did not reach. The CONCRETE half has not moved. All six
 *     figures are read off `WIDER_ARMS` and the mirrors by 'the WIDER ledger's header
 *     figures are derived from its ARMS'; the per-KEY class is derived from the arm
 *     verdicts, never written down beside them, so a MIXED key cannot be filed whole.
 *   - **the pairs with no entry in either** unmirrored ledger — the population minus
 *     the union of the two ledgers above. ⛔ Not written down here in any form: the
 *     census derives it and pins it (objectui#7433). ⚠️ This line used to carry a
 *     running chain of deltas (141 → 142 → 143 → 144 → 147, one per card). Every one
 *     of those was computed against the stale pair count above, so they were
 *     arithmetic on a wrong base and are NOT re-derivable from this file; objectui#7352
 *     contract review replaced the chain with a measurement, which then rotted the
 *     same way the count under it did. ⛔ Do not restart the chain and ⛔ do not
 *     restate the difference as a digit — subtract the union from the registry count,
 *     both read from the file, which is what the census does.
 *   - **the pairs with no `KnownDrift` entry** — the population minus that ledger,
 *     the "pairs with no entry" `LedgerMismatch` speaks of. Derived by the same
 *     census, and likewise not written down here.
 *
 * ## Two ratchets, because the forward comparison has two halves
 *
 * The forward comparison runs over the UNION of the mirror's keys and the
 * declaration's, and a declared key can fail it in two structurally different ways:
 * the mirror declares the key and REFUSES its declared type (`NarrowerThanDeclared`
 * → `KnownDrift`), or the mirror has never heard of the key at all
 * (`UnmirroredDeclaredKeys` → `UnmirroredDeclared`). The second half was invisible
 * until objectui#6058 — an unmirrored key did not compare unequal, it left the
 * comparison entirely — so it is ledgered separately, seeded at its own measured
 * debt, and `KnownDrift` keeps its meaning and its citable history untouched.
 *
 * The second half is itself recorded in TWO ledgers, because its keys do not share
 * a remedy (objectui#6152). `UnmirroredDeclared` holds the keys where MIRRORING is
 * the fix; `RuntimeOnlyDeclared` holds callback-shaped keys that are runtime slots
 * and must never be mirrored at all. Both are reconciled against ONE measurement,
 * through the union at `RecordedUnmirrored`, so a key cannot fall between them.
 *
 * ## And a THIRD direction, which is a different comparison (objectui#7069)
 *
 * Both halves above are the FORWARD comparison: they ask whether everything the
 * declaration admits survives the mirror. Neither can see the reverse inequality —
 * a mirrored, data-shaped key whose mirror ACCEPTS a spelling the declaration
 * refuses. `NarrowerThanDeclared` finds the declared type fits, so the key is
 * silent; `UnmirroredDeclaredKeys` finds the key present in `.shape`, so it never
 * enters. The blindness is structural, not an omission, and it is pinned as such at
 * `assertionNarrowerOperatorIsBlindToAWidening` and
 * `assertionUnmirroredOperatorIsBlindToAWidening` rather than argued here.
 *
 * It is the direction that faces the AUTHOR: the mirror is what validates written
 * metadata, so a wider key returns a green `safeParse` on a spelling `tsc` refuses.
 * `WiderThanDeclaredKeys` → `WiderThanDeclared` is the third ledger, reconciled by
 * `assertionWiderMatchesLedger` and seeded at its own measured debt.
 *
 * ⚠️ Its measurement has a stated hole, and the hole is where the producer that
 * motivated the card lives: a slot spelled through `SchemaNodeSchema` reads
 * `unknown` on the input face, because that const is annotated `z.ZodType< any >`
 * to break its own recursion. `Unconstrained` excludes that face and says why; the
 * runtime leg at the bottom of this file bounds the excluded region by pinning that
 * every lazy node under the registry is that one const.
 *
 * ## KNOWN_DRIFT is a ratchet, not a waiver
 *
 * 41 of the registered pairs carry TYPE drift TODAY (measured, not assumed). Each is
 * pinned to its EXACT drifted key set, so the entry fails when new drift appears on
 * that mirror AND when the recorded drift is fixed — a stale entry cannot rot
 * quietly. Correcting them is not one change: the pairs below split into DISJOINT
 * vocabularies where one side is dead, required-vs-optional mismatches, structural
 * pairs that ride @objectstack/spec unification (objectui#2231), and one DELIBERATE
 * divergence that must stay expressible (`PageNodeSchema.pageType`). Each carries
 * its measurement and its reason inline.
 *
 * It was 17 until objectui#5927 landed the seven STRICT WIDENINGS (group A of that
 * card's grouping) — the class where the TS side is simply a superset and the
 * renderer was measured to implement the missing spellings. Four entries left the
 * ledger outright (`SelectSchema`, `ButtonGroupSchema`, `ObjectChartSchema`,
 * `ViewSwitcherSchema`) and two shrank to the keys that are NOT widenings
 * (`DataTableSchema` kept `rowActions`, `FormSchema` kept `fields`/`mode`). The
 * remaining classes are rulings, not edits, and are deliberately still here.
 *
 * Then 12 became 36 with objectui#6124, which is the opposite movement from #5927's
 * and must not be read as regression: 24 pairs ENTERED (and 4 grew) because the
 * ruling put a NAMED REFUSAL on the mirror side of 35 runtime-slot handler keys while
 * their TypeScript twins stay callable. That drift is the ruling's intended shape,
 * ledgered so the ratchet holds it exactly — a pair leaving this class means either
 * the mirror accepts a function again or a renderer lost its callback.

 * what the mirror accepts at RUNTIME, where the lazy union does validate. Comparing
 * there would report the annotation and not the accept-set, so those keys are not
 * measured. The runtime leg at the bottom of this file is what bounds the region.
 *
 * ⭐ The hole was TEN consts wide and objectui#7760 took it to THREE. That card gave
 * seven of them their existing TypeScript declaration as both type arguments, on the
 * maintainer ruling of decision batch #69 — no runtime accept set moved and no
 * declaration moved, so what changed is only what this comparison can SEE. The three
 * that kept the annotation each refused the argument for a MEASURED reason, recorded
 * on that card: `app.zod.ts#NavigationItemSchema` and
 * `complex.zod.ts#FilterBuilderConditionSchema` because the mirror already accepts
 * more than the declaration states (`id` optional against a required one; `is_null` /
 * `is_not_null` against `FilterBuilderOperator`), so the assignment `tsc` performs to
 * check the annotation IS this ledger's comparison and it fails; and
 * `complex.zod.ts#FilterGroupSchema` transitively, since its `conditions` arm is the
 * first of those two. ⛔ None of the three is an inference cycle — that was the risk
 * the ruling time-boxed a trial for, and it did not fire on any of the ten.
 *
 * ⚠️ What that bought, and it is the point of the card: the producer objectui#7069
 * called systematic — the `z.union([SchemaNodeSchema, z.array(SchemaNodeSchema)])`
 * spelling — is INSIDE the comparison now, and the three keys it had been hiding are
 * in the ledger below. The exclusion is still live, so this predicate is not dead
 * code; it now covers the three consts above rather than the whole schema-node face.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is deliberately NOT recursive, and that is a measurement rather than a
 * preference. A version descending into object properties and array elements was
 * written and withdrawn: on the pairs with the most structure it drove the whole
 * `WiderOf< K >` instantiation to `any`, and `any` is assignable to `never`, so the
 * invariant below went SILENTLY GREEN on precisely those pairs — a guard that
 * cannot fail, wearing the shape of a stricter one.
 * `assertionNoVacuousWiderMeasurement` exists because of that attempt and pins the
 * failure mode, so the next deeper predicate cannot land unnoticed.
 *
 * What the shallow form costs: an `unknown` NESTED one level further down — a
 * schema node inside an array element's property — is not excluded, so those
 * entries record the annotation rather than an accept-set gap. They are seeded and
 * labelled, under the ledger's SCHEMA-NODE class note.

 *
 * ## Why the assignability test cannot see it
 *
 * `Record[string, number]` and `Partial[Record[BreakpointName, number]]` are
 * MUTUALLY assignable: TypeScript grants an implicit index signature to mapped and
 * anonymous object types, so the partial record fits the open one, and the open
 * one fits the partial one because every member it could supply is `number` where
 * `number | undefined` is wanted. ⇒ `[A] extends [B]` and `[B] extends [A]` are
 * BOTH true, so neither this direction's operator nor `NarrowerThanDeclared`
 * reports the pair. That is not one direction missing a case; the pair is
 * invisible to that predicate outright. Measured on `GridSchema.columns` at this
 * card's base (`3f775eeb8`), where `safeParse({ type: 'grid', columns: { xxl: 6 } })`
 * returned green and `tsc` refused the same node. ⚠️ That reading is HISTORICAL:
 * objectui#8516 (`d4733f27e`) narrowed that mirror to a `z.partialRecord`, so the
 * pair is clean on both faces today and this clause is what would report it if the
 * mirror were widened back. ⛔ Do not restate it as a live one.
 *
 * ## The bound, stated because a predicate that does not state one reads as wider
 *
 * This looks at the TOP-LEVEL union arms of the slot and no deeper — not into array
 * elements, not into an arm's own properties. Same shallowness as `Unconstrained`
 * above and for the same reason: a recursive version of this predicate has the
 * failure mode that one had, where descending drove whole instantiations to `any`
 * and the invariant went silently green on exactly the pairs with the most
 * structure. ⇒ An open record NESTED one level down is NOT reported, and a future
 * card widening the reach has to re-run the census, not just the pins.
 *
 * ## Where it sits in the operator, and why that placement is the guarantee
 *
 * It runs ONLY on the branch the assignability test already called clean. A key
 * this file reports today therefore cannot stop being reported by anything here —
 * the change is additive by construction, not by assertion. Every ledgered pair is
 * reconciled against the measurement anyway by `assertionWiderMatchesLedger`, and
 * the additivity itself is pinned on a synthetic carrying BOTH classes at once
 * (`assertionOpenRecordClauseIsAdditive`), because a guarantee nobody has watched
 * fail is not a guarantee. ⛔ A bare count of the pairs stood here and was removed:
 * no pin reached it, which is the objectui#7733 shape this file is about.

 * `NarrowerThanDeclared` asks whether the DECLARED type fits through the mirror;
 * this asks whether what the MIRROR accepts fits inside the declaration. The two
 * are independent — a pair can fail both (disjoint vocabularies), either, or
 * neither — which is why the reverse inequality never entered the forward
 * comparison, and `UnmirroredDeclaredKeys` cannot see it either because a wider key
 * IS mirrored and so never leaves the comparison. Both blindnesses are PINNED as
 * synthetic recognition cases below rather than asserted in prose.
 *
 * Why this direction is not cosmetic symmetry: the mirror is the AUTHORING
 * boundary. A wider key hands an author a green `safeParse` on a spelling `tsc`
 * refuses, so the two published faces disagree about the accept-set and the runtime
 * reader receives input the published types say cannot exist.
 *
 * `DeclaredKeys` and not `keyof D` supplies the declared half, for the reason
 * `WithoutIndexSignature` gives: most declarations carry `BaseSchema`'s string
 * index signature, which resolves `D[K]` to `any` for a key the declaration does
 * not really state — and `any` absorbs the comparison in this direction exactly as
 * silently as in the other one.

/* ── The measured unmirrored-declared ledger (objectui#6058) ────────────────── */

/**
 * Exact DECLARED-BUT-UNMIRRORED key set per pair: keys the published TypeScript
 * invites an author to write and the published validator has never heard of.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE QUOTING THE NUMBER — every figure in this heading is a
 * ## READING AT THE CARD THAT PRODUCED IT, never today's: 121 at objectui#6058, 98 by
 * ## RECLASSIFICATION at objectui#6152, 97 by the first REPAIR at objectui#6639, 96 by
 * ## RETIREMENT at objectui#7623, 94 by REPAIR again at objectui#7352, 87 by MIRRORING
 * ## BY REFERENCE at objectui#7779. Abridged — it names one card per step and skips
 * ## three movements the neighbouring steps absorb (objectui#6576 +1, objectui#7129
 * ## −1, objectui#7655 +2); the unabridged chain is the `UnmirroredDeclared` bullet in
 * ## the file header. ⛔ None of these is today's figure. Today's is one line down.
 *
 * objectui#6058 seeded this ledger at **121 keys**, and — on ONE line, because the
 * pin below reads this sentence off disk —
 * **86 keys** is what this ledger records today.
 * The movements between the two are different facts. objectui#6152 measured the 23
 * callback-shaped (`on*`) keys and ruled that mirroring is the wrong remedy for every
 * one of them;
 * they moved, intact and still pinned, to `RuntimeOnlyDeclared` below — ⛔ nothing
 * was mirrored, no declaration was removed, nothing was waived by that move. Then
 * objectui#6639 MIRRORED `ObjectGridSchema.title` (census-directed maintainer
 * ruling 2026-08-29, declare branch) — one defect actually repaired, the ledger's
 * first shrink by repair. Then objectui#7129 and objectui#7623 each RETIRED a key by
 * deleting the DECLARATION (`DetailViewSectionSchema.hideEmpty`;
 * `DashboardComponentSchema.title`) — shrinks by removal, which is neither a repair
 * of the mirror nor a waiver: the key stops being offered to authors at all. Then
 * objectui#7352 MIRRORED the two `drillDown` keys (`ChartSchema`,
 * `ObjectDataTableSchema`) by minting the `DrillDownConfigSchema` both entries named
 * as their remedy — the second and third repairs, and the first to close two entries
 * in one change. Then objectui#7655 SEEDED a `ChatbotFloatingSchema` entry with two
 * keys — growth, and the only growth this ledger has seen since the seed. Then
 * objectui#7779 MIRRORED eight of `ObjectViewSchema`'s keys BY REFERENCE and RETIRED a
 * ninth (`viewTabBar`) — the largest single shrink, and the movement this docstring
 * did not follow: the figure above read 94, fully green, until objectui#8243.
 *
 * ## The decomposition of "121" — a reading at NAMED REVISIONS, so it cannot rot
 *
 * ⛔ What "121" used to mean is no longer restated as a LIVE decomposition, and
 * ⛔ do not restore one. objectui#8222 removed the file header's copy for a reason
 * that applies here too: every term but the reclassification needs each key's
 * PROVENANCE — which of today's keys descend from the seed — and no ledger in
 * this file records provenance; they record entry → key set as it stands. So no
 * instrument here can derive it, a live decomposition is unpinnable, and this one duly
 * rotted: it stood as `94 − 1 seeded + 3 mirrored + 2 retired + 23 reclassified`
 * from objectui#7352 through four ledger movements, three of which moved one of its
 * terms.
 *
 * What CAN be written down is a reading at NAMED REVISIONS — nothing later can make
 * it false, so it needs no pin against the ledger and no hand re-derivation at the next
 * repair. Measured by the walk `ledgerEntryMembers` performs, run over this file at two
 * commits:
 *
 *   - MEASURED at `beccf1c6b` — this repository's oldest reachable commit, after
 *     objectui#6152's RECLASSIFICATION and before objectui#6639's first REPAIR —
 *     this ledger held **98 keys**.
 *     ⭐ That is the positive control for the whole walk: it is exactly the
 *     `121 became 98` the heading states, arrived at from the other direction.
 *   - MEASURED at `ed7178bf3` (objectui#8242's landing, and the revision objectui#8243
 *     measured on), by SET INTERSECTION on entry → key pairs rather than by
 *     subtracting one total from another:
 *     **85** of those keys were still in the ledger and **13** had left.
 *   - So the seed decomposes, completely and with every term measured, as
 *     **85 + 13 + 23 = 121** — survivors, departures, and objectui#6152's
 *     reclassification. Those figures are pinned against each other by objectui#8243:
 *     arithmetic among historical readings only, and ⛔ nothing in that pin reads
 *     the live ledger, which is the whole reason it cannot rot.
 *
 * ⚠️ **One split below this is PROSE-DERIVED and must not be folded into the
 * figures above.** The 13 departures divide **10 MIRRORED / 3 RETIRED**, and that
 * division is read off the cards, not off any ledger: objectui#6639 mirrored
 * `ObjectGridSchema.title`; objectui#7129 retired `DetailViewSectionSchema.hideEmpty`;
 * objectui#7623 retired `DashboardComponentSchema.title`; objectui#7352 mirrored
 * `ChartSchema.drillDown`, the only one of its two `drillDown` rows that was ever part
 * of the 121 — `ObjectDataTableSchema`'s was seeded later by objectui#6576 and is in
 * neither measured set; objectui#7779 mirrored eight of `ObjectViewSchema`'s keys and
 * retired `viewTabBar`. 10 + 3 = 13 reconciles with the measurement, ⛔ which is not
 * the same as being measured. **The 13 is measured; the 10 / 3 is not**, and a later
 * reader must not collapse the two into one confident figure. (Measurable in principle
 * — a MIRRORED key is in the mirror today, a RETIRED one is declared nowhere —
 * but that would be a LIVE instrument, and a live instrument here is exactly the
 * maintenance cost this section was rewritten to remove.)
 *
 * ⚠️ Today's figure is NOT 85. Two keys entered this ledger AFTER the 121 —
 * `ChatbotFloatingSchema`'s `displayMode` and `floatingConfig`, seeded by objectui#7655
 * — so the survivors plus those two are what the live figure above counts.
 * ⛔ Do not update the 85 when the ledger moves: it is a reading at `ed7178bf3` and
 * it stays one. The live figure is the pinned one, and it is the ONLY figure in this
 * docstring that moves.
 *
 * A card that cites 121 as the size of the mirroring problem, or any reading in the
 * heading's chain as a shrink from it, is wrong in both directions. objectui#6141 is
 * the standing example of what a silently moved count costs — it is why this
 * paragraph is in the ledger rather than in a commit message.
 *
 * ## ⛔ SHRINK-ONLY, and why a seed is a FLOOR rather than a waiver
 *
 * The obvious misreading is that seeding a ledger at 121 facts waives 121 defects.
 * It is the opposite, and the reason is that **before this ledger the guard saw
 * ZERO of them**. `NarrowerThanDeclared` maps over the INTERSECTION
 * `MirroredKeys< M > & keyof D`, so a declared key the mirror never mentions did
 * not compare unequal — it LEFT THE COMPARISON. Nothing that was previously caught
 * is being let through, because there was no such thing. Seeding takes the count of
 * VISIBLE, RATCHETED facts from 0 to 121 and installs a floor: the problem cannot
 * grow while they are worked off, and a new declared-but-unmirrored key on any of
 * the registered pairs reddens immediately (`assertionRatchetRejectsFreshDrift`) —
 * including a callback-shaped one, which reddens until it is filed in
 * `RuntimeOnlyDeclared` (`assertionSplitLedgerRejectsFreshCallback`).
 *
 * Same instrument and same discipline as objectui#6133's `KNOWN_HAND_TYPED_GUARDS`,
 * which is the landed precedent for this shape in this repo: seed at the measured
 * debt, fail on growth, fail on staleness, never offer a route that raises a line.
 *
 * ## What each entry is, and where the remedy lives
 *
 * ⚠️ The remedy is NOT uniformly "mirror the key" — objectui#6058's ruling is
 * explicit that forcing the 121 per-key decisions now would be wrong. Two splits
 * are recorded here so whoever works them off does not re-derive them:
 *
 *   - **SPEC-DERIVED (3 entries, 17 keys)** — it was 2 / 3 until objectui#7762 MIRRORED
 *     `ObjectGridSchema.exportOptions` as the spec's object arm BY REFERENCE, which
 *     re-derived that entry (its fourteen remaining keys) into this half: the #7779
 *     membership mechanism a second time, and the first entry to arrive here by a single
 *     mirrored member. ⚠️ Its keys' remedy did NOT change with the half — they are still
 *     plain local omissions; the reading is on the entry. Then `DashboardWidgetSchema`, and since
 *     objectui#7779 `ObjectViewSchema` again, by MEMBERSHIP this time rather than by
 *     the old false positive: that card made the mirror reference
 *     `SpecListViewSchema.shape.navigation` / `.searchableFields` /
 *     `.filterableFields` in CODE, so `SPEC_DERIVED_PAIRS` re-derives the pair
 *     here, and its one remaining key, `listViews`, is a value-type question the
 *     card's fallback clause left with the maintainer — NOT objectui#2231's
 *     unification (ruled out for this pair by name). It was 1 / 2 until then; 2 / 12
 *     until objectui#7279 RE-DERIVED `ObjectViewSchema`'s side and moved that entry
 *     (ten keys) to the LOCAL half — a RECLASSIFICATION on evidence, not a repair:
 *     no key moved between ledgers and no mirror changed. It was 3 / 13 until
 *     objectui#7623 RETIRED
 *     `DashboardComponentSchema.title` by deleting the DECLARATION — the
 *     objectui#7129 route, reaching this half for the first time. That key was never
 *     going to be answered by #2231 unification: the spec's strict `DashboardSchema`
 *     refuses a root `title` outright, and objectui#7509 had already retired every
 *     read of it, so the local declaration was offering a member the spec models
 *     nowhere and no renderer consumed. ⚠️ objectui#6705 invalidated the
 *     evidence for `ObjectViewSchema`: it was no longer in
 *     `SPEC_DERIVED_PAIRS` below (until objectui#7779 put a real code reference
 *     there), because it had never referenced a spec schema — it was
 *     `BaseSchema.extend({…})` of local literals, and the pre-#6705 text scanner
 *     charged it a neighbouring private const's `Spec…` token. That misclassification
 *     was left STANDING as #6705 found it — re-routing those keys from #2231's
 *     unification question to a local mirror edit is a remedy decision on the
 *     `UnmirroredDeclared` ledger, which #6705 was fenced out of — until
 *     objectui#7279 re-derived the side on two measurements. (a) The mirror
 *     (`objectql.zod.ts`, `ObjectViewSchema = BaseSchema.extend({…})`) took NO
 *     shape from the spec THEN (objectui#7779 later gave it three spec slots by
 *     reference, which is what re-derives it into this half today): every member was a local literal or a `z.lazy` to a
 *     sibling objectui mirror, and the `Spec…` consts below it (`KanbanConfig`,
 *     `ViewKindEnum`) feed `ListViewSchema`. (b) Read through the pin
 *     (`@objectstack/spec@17.2.0`, `ui` entry, all 122 exported object schemas
 *     walked; control keys `objectName` / `columns` hit), the spec models FOUR of
 *     the ten keys on View-shaped schemas — `listViews` on `ViewSchema`;
 *     `navigation`, `searchableFields`, `filterableFields` on `ListViewSchema` and
 *     `ObjectListViewSchema` — and SIX nowhere: `allowCreateView`,
 *     `defaultListView`, `defaultViewType`, `showViewSwitcher`, `viewActions`,
 *     `viewTabBar`. Neither fact makes the pair spec-derived: this route exists for
 *     a mirror that IS the spec schema by reference, where growing a key means
 *     diverging from the spec; this mirror can grow any key without touching it.
 *     So the entry is LOCAL and its remedy is the ordinary local route
 *     (objectui#6152's worklist) — a widening of ten keys is a remedy on the manual
 *     floor, ⛔ not performed by #7279. The 4 / 6 reading is recorded on the entry
 *     for whoever mirrors: the four take their shape BY REFERENCE from the spec slot
 *     that models them, the six are plain hand-written omissions.
 *     For `DashboardWidgetSchema` the reading is unchanged (reconfirmed on the tree
 *     by objectui#7279: `specFieldsExcept(SpecDashboardWidgetSchema.shape, …)`):
 *     its mirror takes its shape BY REFERENCE from `@objectstack/spec`. An
 *     unmirrored declared key there means the LOCAL declaration carries members the
 *     spec schema does not model, which is objectui#2231's unification question and
 *     NOT a local mirror edit. They are marked, not exempted: exempting them in the
 *     instrument would re-blind exactly the pairs objectui#5927 leaned on hardest.
 *   - **LOCAL (11 entries, 69 keys)** — plain omissions from a hand-written mirror.
 *     It was 12 / 84 until objectui#7762 MIRRORED `ObjectGridSchema.exportOptions`: one key
 *     REPAIRED and the entry's other fourteen carried out of this half with it, because the
 *     spec reference that repair introduced re-derives the pair into the SPEC-DERIVED half
 *     above — the same two-effects-in-one-move shape objectui#7779 had on `ObjectViewSchema`.
 *     It was 13 / 94 until objectui#7779 MIRRORED eight of `ObjectViewSchema`'s ten
 *     keys and RETIRED a ninth, and the spec reference that mirroring introduced
 *     re-derived the entry (down to `listViews`) into the SPEC-DERIVED half — 12 / 84
 *     again, the figure this half read before objectui#7279, the same entry leaving by
 *     the opposite mechanism. 12 / 84 until objectui#7279 RECLASSIFIED the `ObjectViewSchema` entry
 *     (ten keys) into this half from the SPEC-DERIVED one — the split's first move
 *     of an ENTRY between its halves; no key and no mirror moved. Before that it
 *     was 13 / 84 until objectui#7129 RETIRED `DetailViewSectionSchema.hideEmpty`,
 *     a shrink by removing the DECLARATION rather than by mirroring it, 12 / 83
 *     until objectui#7352 MIRRORED `ChartSchema.drillDown` — its whole entry — and
 *     11 / 82 until objectui#7655 SEEDED a `ChatbotFloatingSchema` entry with the two
 *     keys that face declares alongside `ChatbotSchema` — an entry and two keys
 *     gained; `ChatbotSchema`'s own entry did not move.
 *
 * ⚠️ Both counts moved with the reclassification: the spec-derived side lost
 * `ObjectViewSchema.onNavigate` (14 → 13) and the local side lost the other 22
 * (107 → 85; 84 since objectui#6639 mirrored `ObjectGridSchema.title`, 83 since
 * objectui#7129 retired one). The pair COUNTS did not move under the
 * reclassification — every affected pair kept keys here — so the split read 16
 * entries / 97 keys after it. Three later changes moved the entry count itself:
 * objectui#6576 SEEDED `ObjectDataTableSchema` (a 17th entry, in neither half
 * above), objectui#7129 RETIRED an entry from the LOCAL half, objectui#7623
 * RETIRED one from the SPEC-DERIVED half (13 → 12 keys there), objectui#7352
 * MIRRORED two — the LOCAL `ChartSchema` entry and the seeded `ObjectDataTableSchema`
 * one — and objectui#7655 SEEDED the LOCAL `ChatbotFloatingSchema` entry, born with
 * two keys. objectui#7279 then moved `ObjectViewSchema` between the halves (2 / 12
 * and 12 / 84 before it) without moving the totals. objectui#7779 then shrank that
 * same entry from ten keys to one (96 → 87 keys; the entry count held) and moved it
 * back to the SPEC-DERIVED half by membership — the ledger's first shrink by
 * MIRRORING BY REFERENCE across most of an entry, and its second RETIREMENT on the
 * LOCAL half (`viewTabBar`). objectui#7762 then did both halves of that move again on
 * `ObjectGridSchema` with ONE key: mirroring `exportOptions` as the spec's object arm by
 * reference shrank the ledger 87 → 86 and re-derived the entry (fourteen keys) from the
 * LOCAL half into the SPEC-DERIVED one, so the entry count held while BOTH split figures
 * moved. The seeded pair is no longer
 * among them, and the ledger now totals — on ONE line, because the pin below reads
 * this sentence off disk —
 * **14 entries / 86 keys** — 3 / 17 spec-derived, 11 / 69 local.
 *
 * ⛔ The four split figures above and this totals line are PINNED: 'objectui#7279'
 * at the bottom of this file derives every one of them from the `UnmirroredDeclared`
 * ledger and `SPEC_DERIVED_PAIRS` membership and compares them with the figures read
 * off this header. A figure edited by hand without the ledger moving is red, and so
 * is a ledger that moved without its figure — which is exactly how this split drifted
 * three times between objectui#6058 and objectui#7279.
 *
 * ## How this was measured, and the trap that makes the number hard to get
 *
 * ⚠️ **Do not read the offending set off the compile error.** objectui#6058 lost a
 * pass to this. The behaviour is not "TypeScript truncates", it is that the two
 * spellings of the same assertion print DIFFERENTLY, and the worse one gives no
 * sign that it is incomplete. Both measured:
 *
 *   - through a NAMED alias — the spelling `assertionDriftMatchesLedger` uses via
 *     `LedgerMismatch` — TS prints the ALIAS NAME and elaborates with exactly ONE
 *     member: `Type 'LedgerMismatch' is not assignable to type 'never'. Type
 *     '"complex.zod.ts#ChatbotSchema"' is not assignable to type 'never'.` There is
 *     no ellipsis, so 23 offending pairs read as one. `--noErrorTruncation` does NOT
 *     expand it, and neither a distributive conditional nor a template-literal
 *     wrapper forces expansion — both re-associate to the alias.
 *   - written INLINE, as `assertionUnmirroredMatchesLedger` below is, TS resolves the
 *     union and prints it WITH a truncation marker: ten neutralised entries printed
 *     five names, `... 4 more ...`, and the last. Honest about being partial.
 *
 * That is the whole reason the new assertion is spelled inline. It is still only a
 * pointer: the authoritative read is the compiler API — build a Program over
 * `tsconfig.test.json`, declare one binding per pair, and walk each type's union
 * members reading `isStringLiteral().value`, bypassing type printing entirely. Its
 * non-vacuity control on the seeding run: it read all 158 pairs and returned an
 * EMPTY set for 142 of them, so it is discriminating rather than uniformly silent.

/**
 * Callback-shaped declared keys that are RUNTIME SLOTS rather than authorable
 * metadata: kept on the declaration, deliberately never mirrored, separately pinned.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ THIS IS WHERE 23 KEYS WENT — a RECLASSIFICATION, not a fix
 *
 * `UnmirroredDeclared` above was seeded at **121 keys** by objectui#6058, and — on
 * ONE line, because the pin below reads this sentence off disk —
 * `UnmirroredDeclared` records **86 keys** today.
 * These 23 moved here whole. Keys have since left that ledger by MIRRORING and by
 * RETIREMENT, but the move recorded HERE is neither and repaired nothing. ⛔ Nothing
 * was mirrored by it, no declaration was removed, no defect was repaired and nothing was
 * waived: the same 23 facts are still measured, still declared-but-unmirrored, still
 * reconciled against the same measurement — under a different remedy.
 *
 * ⚠️ **23 is a HISTORICAL figure and this ledger no longer holds exactly those 23.**
 * It counts what objectui#6152 RECLASSIFIED, which is a past event and cannot change;
 * objectui#6150's `TreeViewSchema.onNodeClick` arrived afterwards, so the live total is
 * larger. ⛔ Do not "correct" the 23 to match it, and ⛔ do not restate the live total
 * here — it is written down once, in the file header, where objectui#8222 pins it.
 *
 * ⛔ The decomposition of "121" is NOT restated here. ONE site owns it — the
 * `UnmirroredDeclared` docstring above, where it is written as a reading at named
 * revisions and therefore cannot rot. objectui#8222 removed the file header's copy
 * for the same reason and deferred to that site; a second copy standing beside a
 * corrected one is how this figure rotted in the first place (objectui#8243: this
 * paragraph and the one above it both read 94 for a day after objectui#7779 took the
 * ledger to 87, and every pin in the file was green). objectui#6141 is the standing
 * example of what a silently moved count costs — and the pair count in the file
 * header is the second, re-derived at objectui#7352 contract review.
 *
 * ## Why mirroring is the wrong remedy for these (the objectui#6152 ruling)
 *
 * Measured on the SHIPPED `dist/*.d.ts`, all 23 are already function-only —
 * `((row: any) => void) | undefined` and the like, with no string alternative:
 *
 *   - ⛔ **Mirroring them enforces nothing.** The only available spelling is
 *     `z.function()`, which **no serialized authored document can satisfy**. It would
 *     move 23 rows off a ledger while adding validator surface no authored payload
 *     can ever populate — converting VISIBLE debt into INVISIBLE non-enforcement,
 *     which is the "declared ≠ enforced" shape this whole file exists to close.
 *   - ⛔ **Narrowing the declaration is not available.** objectui#4453's precedent
 *     narrowed a key that accepted `string | function` to `typeof === 'function'`;
 *     there is no string branch left here to remove.
 *   - ⛔ **Removing the declaration would break shipped renderers.** 21 of the 23 are
 *     read off `schema.*` in renderer source. ⭐ Measured by AST, because a plain
 *     `schema.onX` grep UNDERCOUNTS — `renderers/complex/data-table.tsx` DESTRUCTURES
 *     four of them (`const { onPageChange, … } = schema`) and a grep reads those as
 *     unread. The values reach the renderer by a third channel that is neither
 *     authored metadata nor a React prop: a sibling component SYNTHESISING a
 *     schema-shaped object in code and rendering it through `SchemaRenderer`
 *     (`ObjectGrid.tsx:2937` builds `const dataTableSchema: any`, rendered at
 *     `:3735`; `ListView`, `ObjectView`, `RelatedList`, `ObjectKanban`,
 *     `ObjectCalendar`, `ObjectGantt` and `ObjectGallery` all do the same).
 *
 * Authored anywhere: **zero of 23**, positive-controlled — a planted `"onRowClick"`
 * value in a schema-catalog fixture made the same search return exactly that line.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The 16/7 split — these 23 did NOT all arrive the same way
 *
 * Read as "the mirrors omit callbacks by policy" this ledger would be wrong about two
 * thirds of itself. Measured across `../zod/`: **73 `on*` keys are ALREADY mirrored**
 * (56 `z.function()`, 11 `z.string()`, 3 `z.any()`, 3 named schemas).
 *
 *   - **16 were OVERSIGHTS.** `DataTableSchema`'s own mirror already declares four
 *     callbacks (`onRowEdit`, `onRowDelete`, `onSelectionChange`, `onColumnsReorder`),
 *     `FormSchema`'s three (`onSubmit`, `onChange`, `onCancel`), `DetailViewSchema`'s
 *     one (`onBack` — and in the OTHER dialect, `z.string()`). The omitted keys sit in
 *     the same object literals as the included ones.
 *   - **7 are POLICY.** `objectql.zod.ts` carries zero `on*` and zero `z.function()`
 *     in the entire file, and says so in passing at `:164`, where `successMessage` is
 *     described as what applies "when no `onSuccess` handler is given" — the mirror
 *     naming the authored alternative to a runtime callback it deliberately does not
 *     model. Those seven are `ObjectFormSchema`'s 5, `ObjectGridSchema`'s 1 and
 *     `ObjectViewSchema`'s 1.
 *
 * Reclassifying all 23 is still right — the remedy is the same for both groups — but
 * they are not the same fact, and a later reader must not infer uniform intent from
 * uniform treatment.
 *
 * ## Standing prior art, reached independently for 3 of the 23
 *
 * `docs/audits/2026-07-objectview-detailview-schema.md` ruled this before either
 * ledger existed. At `:148`, on `onNavigate`: "A function. Non-serializable; cannot
 * live in a JSON protocol." — filed under **Keep local**. At `:237-241`: `onNavigate`,
 * `onTabChange` and `onAddComment` are "live state and callbacks, not metadata", they
 * "must never enter a serializable protocol", and "their existence on a schema is
 * itself the smell: they are why this 'schema' cannot be validated, persisted, or
 * authored — it is a props bag wearing a schema's clothes". objectui#4650 is the same
 * split expressed in types: `ObjectFormPropsSchema` is "serialisable authoring keys
 * only", `ObjectFormComponentProps` is the renderer's props, "none of which can exist
 * in authored metadata".
 *
 * ⭐ And one piece of evidence that the declaration was ALREADY not trusted:
 * `DetailView.tsx:1402` reads `onTabChange` through an `(schema as any)` cast — at its
 * ONLY read site, for a key that IS declared on the type.
 *
 * ## ⛔ What this category is NOT
 *
 * Not a waiver, not a bucket. Three pins hold it to its meaning, and none of them is
 * prose: `assertionUnmirroredMatchesLedger` reconciles ONE measurement against the
 * UNION of both ledgers (`RecordedUnmirrored`), so a NEW callback-shaped unmirrored
 * key reddens until it is filed here and a recorded one that leaves the measurement
 * fails as STALE naming its own pair — both directions pinned on synthetic pairs at
 * `assertionSplitLedgerRejectsFreshCallback` and `…RejectsStaleRuntimeOnly`;
 * `assertionRuntimeOnlyIsCallbackShapedOnly` refuses a non-callback key here; and
 * `assertionNoCallbackShapedKeyInUnmirroredDeclared` refuses a callback key over
 * there. The move is one-way and shape-checked.
 *
 * ⚠️ The end state is objectui#4650's two-layer split — an authored-metadata type and
 * a renderer-props type per pair, mirroring only the authored half. This ledger is its
 * first honest step: it RECORDS what these keys are without pretending they are fixed.
 * If objectui#6152's escalated second question is ever answered "an authored handler
 * EXPRESSION is a supported dialect" (the 11 `z.string()` mirrors), an `on*` key can
 * become genuinely authorable — that is a RULING, and it moves the key back with the
 * shape pin relaxed deliberately, never by quietly refiling it.

/**
 * Exact WIDER key set per pair, measured against `origin/main`: keys whose mirror
 * admits a spelling the declaration refuses. Pinned exactly, like the ledgers
 * above — a new widening on a listed mirror fails, and so does a listed one that
 * has been repaired.
 *
 * ## Two classes, and only one of them is an accept-set gap
 *
 * **CONCRETE** — both faces are concrete, so the comparison means what it says: an
 * author can write the spelling, `safeParse` returns green, and `tsc` refuses it.
 * `FormSchema.layout` and `SliderSchema.defaultValue` are the plainest instances,
 * and the second is the shape objectui#7069 was filed about, still alive on a pair
 * nobody had looked at.
 *
 * **SCHEMA-NODE** — the mirror's face carries `unknown` NESTED inside an array
 * element or a property, from a recursion-breaking `z.ZodType< any >` annotation
 * (see `Unconstrained`, which excludes such a face at the top level and one array
 * deep but not deeper). These entries record the ANNOTATION, not an accept-set
 * gap: at runtime the lazy union does validate. ⛔ They are not defects to repair
 * one by one, and repairing one would not move this ledger — only re-annotating the
 * const the reading comes from would. They are seeded so the ratchet still covers
 * those pairs: a CONCRETE widening appearing on one of them changes its key set and
 * reddens the invariant.
 *
 * ⭐ That last sentence was tested in full by objectui#7760, which re-annotated seven
 * of the ten consts and took this class from 24 keys to 6 in one commit. ⛔ The class
 * is therefore not a permanent residency: read it as "the instrument cannot see this
 * key YET", and the way a key leaves it is that someone makes the face readable. The
 * three keys that ENTERED this ledger under that card were SCHEMA-NODE readings the
 * day before and are CONCRETE divergences today, with no mirror and no declaration
 * touched.
 *
 * The runtime leg at the bottom of this file is what keeps the second class from
 * silently spreading: it pins the SOURCES — every lazy node under the registered
 * mirrors is one of the named consts — so a new annotated recursive mirror cannot
 * enlarge the region unnoticed.
 *
 * ## Seeded, and why that is a floor and not a waiver
 *
 * Seeded at the debt this direction was already carrying, the shape every ledger in
 * this file landed with (objectui#6058 for the unmirrored direction, objectui#6124
 * for the runtime-slot class). ⛔ No mirror and no declaration was moved to make it
 * green: every entry here is a disposition still to be made, and each is its own
 * card. `assertionRatchetRejectsFreshDrift` above is what makes the floor hold —
 * a widening on a pair this ledger does not name reddens immediately.
 *
 * ## Overlap with `KnownDrift` is expected, not a double-filing
 *
 * A pair can be narrower on one key and wider on another, and a single key can be
 * DISJOINT — each face refusing something the other admits — in which case it is
 * recorded in both ledgers, measured from both sides. That is not the double-filing
 * `assertionLedgerHalvesAreDisjoint` refuses: that one is about the two UNMIRRORED
 * ledgers, which record one measurement between them. This ledger records a
 * SECOND, independent measurement.
 *
 * ## When it fires
 *
 *   1. the message names the pair;
 *   2. resolve `WiderOf< 'THE PAIR' >`, and for each key in the difference resolve
 *      `MirrorInputOf< 'THE PAIR', 'THE KEY' >` beside
 *      `DeclaredTypeOf< 'THE PAIR', 'THE KEY' >` — the two faces side by side are
 *      the whole diagnosis;
 *   3. a key APPEARED — the mirror now accepts a spelling the declaration refuses.
 *      ⛔ Widening the declaration to match is not the default remedy: the mirror is
 *      the authoring boundary, so the contract-first move is to NARROW THE MIRROR
 *      unless the declaration is the face that is wrong;
 *   4. a key DISAPPEARED — the faces agree again; correct or delete the entry.

 *
 * The ledger above records a class per ENTRY, in prose, and its clause for
 * `complex.zod.ts#DashboardComponentSchema.widgets` was three words — "`widgets` is
 * SCHEMA-NODE". True of the widget-envelope arm; false of the other, a
 * `BaseSchema.extend({ type: z.enum(DASHBOARD_COMPONENT_WIDGET_TYPES) })` component
 * node the TypeScript face was missing WHOLE, so the maintainer-ruled `metric-card`
 * node parsed green and `tsc` refused it with no annotation an author could write
 * (objectui#7952, ruled under objectstack#8593 and declared by PR #8296, `c842594`).
 * ⭐ One key, two arms, and the artifact in one absorbed the real divergence in the
 * other. objectui#7759 sorted its whole SCHEMA-NODE bucket out of its disposition
 * lane on verdicts of that shape, which is what objectui#8252 re-judged.
 *
 * ## What is measured here and what is judged
 *
 * The ARM ENUMERATION is a MEASUREMENT — `measureMirrorArms` walks the mirror VALUE,
 * for the same reason the blind-region leg at the bottom of this file is at runtime:
 * at the type level every unconstrained face looks alike. The per-arm VERDICT is a
 * judgement, and this table is where it lives so that three things can be pinned
 * that prose could not carry: every ledgered key names one verdict PER MEASURED ARM
 * (a mirror that grows an arm reddens until someone judges it), the row set is
 * exactly the ledger's key set, and objectui#7952's key cannot collapse back to a
 * single verdict.
 *
 * ⛔ The verdicts are NOT derived. At runtime BOTH of `widgets`' arms reach
 * `SchemaNodeSchema` — the component arm through `BaseSchema`'s own `body` /
 * `children` slots — so "reaches a lazy node" separates neither arm from the other
 * and would classify every component-node arm in this repo as an artifact.
 * ⚠️ objectui#7952 describes that arm as having "no schema-node recursion in it at
 * all"; measured, it has, through the base. Its conclusion survives the correction,
 * because what makes the arm CONCRETE is its own `type` enum and passthrough shape,
 * not the absence of the artifact underneath it.
 *
 * ## The census objectui#8252 ran, on `c842594`
 *
 * Every key in the ledger, arms enumerated from the mirror and judged. Most keys are
 * single-arm, and for those the arm verdict IS the key verdict — a single-arm key
 * has no sibling to hide behind, which is the entire mechanism, so they are recorded
 * rather than reasoned about. Of the keys that ARE unions, exactly one sits in the
 * SCHEMA-NODE bucket and it is objectui#7952's own; the rest were already CONCRETE
 * in objectui#7759's lane, arm by arm, so nothing was re-filed. ⇒ Measured, the
 * shape does not recur. The header bullet carries the figures and they are pinned.
 *
 * ⚠️ Two bounds, stated because a census that does not state them reads as wider
 * than it is. It looked ONE LEVEL DOWN as well — each arm's own shape properties,
 * for a union mixing a schema-node arm with a concrete one — and found none. It does
 * ⛔ NOT answer whether a single-arm SCHEMA-NODE key's reading has a SECOND, concrete
 * cause underneath the artifact: that is a different mechanism from hiding behind a
 * sibling, and it needs a two-face comparison per key rather than an arm count.

/* ── Which exports reference a spec symbol (AST, not raw text) ───────────────── */

/**
 * The exported consts in ONE mirror source whose definition references a `Spec…`
 * symbol — the input to `SPEC_DERIVED_PAIRS`' re-check below.
 *
 * ## Why this parses instead of scanning text (objectui#6705)
 *
 * This used to slice the source between `export const` boundaries and test the
 * slice against a `\bSpec[A-Z]` word pattern. Raw text cannot tell a reference from a mention,
 * and the boundary is not the declaration's end, so the rule had two independent
 * defects that both fired on ONE docstring:
 *
 *   - **A comment counted as a reference.** A docstring naming `SpecGanttConfigSchema`
 *     in PROSE made this test red with nothing about the emitted types, the runtime
 *     or the mirror's actual spec dependency having moved.
 *   - **The window charged text to the wrong declaration.** The docstring sat above
 *     the PRIVATE `GanttConfigExtensionFields` const, which lives textually between
 *     the `ObjectTreeSchema` and `ObjectGanttSchema` exports — so the slice starting
 *     at `ObjectTreeSchema` ran on past its own end and the failure named
 *     `ObjectTreeSchema`, a mirror that references no spec schema at all. The person
 *     who edits a docstring gets a red naming an innocent neighbour several
 *     declarations away.
 *
 * The workaround that shipped (PR #6704) was a docstring reworded to dodge the
 * literal token plus a comment asking the next editor to remember — a convention
 * held by discipline, which is what a gate is supposed to replace.
 *
 * ## What it does instead
 *
 * `Spec…` identifiers are collected from the AST, so a mention inside a comment or
 * a string literal is not a reference — those are not `Identifier` nodes and never
 * reach the test. There is no comment-stripping regex to get wrong on a string that
 * contains `*` `/` sequences, because nothing strips anything.
 *
 * Attribution is by DECLARATION, not by text window: each top-level declaration
 * owns exactly its own initializer. A private const between two exports is charged
 * to neither — except through the one link that is a real dependency, which this
 * follows: a mirror that spreads a private const built from a spec schema IS spec
 * derived, so file-local references are resolved to a fixed point before the
 * exported names are read off. `ObjectGanttSchema`'s dependency survives whether it
 * extends `SpecGanttConfigSchema` inline or through a local field map.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is a precision fix, and the direction that must not be lost is the
 * POSITIVE one: a scanner that stopped seeing comments AND stopped seeing real
 * references would go green on the list below while checking nothing. The fixture
 * suite asserts both directions, and the re-check itself is the live positive
 * proof — every pair in `SPEC_DERIVED_PAIRS` is found by code reference alone.

WHICH SIDE TO CHANGE — decide by what your diff touched, not by which number looks
right (git diff -- packages/types/src/__tests__/zod-mirror-parity.test.ts):

  * you added or removed a ledger KEY (an arm of an entry's union), or an ENTRY that
    carries keys
    => correct BOTH docstring figures to the derived one below, and ADD the history
       sentence the narrative keeps for every move. Expect objectui#7279's split pin
       to fail alongside this one; if it did NOT, the entry count held while the key
       total moved (the objectui#7664 shape) and that asymmetry is information.
  * you edited a docstring figure by hand, or carried one in from a card or a comment
    => put it back to the derived value. The ledger is the measurement; the docstring
       only records it.

⛔ Never reconcile the two by editing a ledger KEY SET: the key sets are pinned against
the mirrors themselves elsewhere in this file, so a key edited to satisfy a sentence
fails there instead — and that is route 1, which objectui#6141 predicted and
objectui#8243 was filed to stop being taken for these two paragraphs specifically.

    arm totals at the top of that bullet, pinned by the objectui#8252 block above.

    prose edit. The two commits are fixed, so a different reading means the INSTRUMENT
    changed, not the history. Re-run \`ledgerEntryMembers('WiderThanDeclared')\` against
    the file at both revisions and diff entry -> key pairs before touching a digit.

  * you reworded the sentence => the spellings this pin reads are
    \`N keys across **M** pairs LEFT\` and \`**E emptied + R reduced = M**\`, each exactly
    once. A reword that drops one is red here rather than quietly unpinned, which is
    the objectui#7733 principle; ⛔ do not "fix" it by deleting the pin.
