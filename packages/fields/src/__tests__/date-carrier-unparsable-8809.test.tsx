/**
 * objectui#8809 — the readonly `date` widget faces draw `formatDate`'s
 * em-dash through the shared `EmptyValue` affordance. **The carrier changes,
 * the glyph does not.**
 *
 * ── The defect, stated precisely ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * The dash these faces drew for an unparsable value was NOT an unnoticed
 * accident. objectui#8194 enumerated the four `formatDate` sites, fed each
 * the same `'not-a-date'`, and split them 3-1 ON PURPOSE — three inherit the
 * shared function's empty face, `GridField` keeps the raw stored string
 * ("showing the user what is actually stored beats hiding it", objectui#3569).
 * That card chose the GLYPH and pinned it.
 *
 * What was still defective is the CARRIER: the dash was painted in a plain
 * span with no `data-slot` of `empty-value` and no accessible name, so a
 * screen reader got naked punctuation — the objectui#8475 (`RelatedList`) /
 * objectui#8491 (`ObjectGrid`) class of defect. This card repairs exactly
 * that and nothing else.
 *
 * ── Why the compatibility claim is the interesting half ──────────────────
 * `EmptyValue`'s OWN default glyph is the em-dash
 * (`components/src/custom/empty.tsx`, `glyph = "—"`). So the rendered TEXT is
 * unchanged, and objectui#8194's three landed `textContent` assertions stay
 * green. That is not a lucky accident — it is the whole reason this repair is
 * available to this card at all. Moving these faces to the raw string instead
 * would reverse #8194's documented, pinned choice and turn its pin red; that
 * is a maintainer-level reversal, deliberately NOT taken here.
 *
 * Every case below therefore asserts BOTH halves: the affordance is present
 * (the repair) and the text is still a dash (the compatibility claim). A
 * future change that satisfies one and breaks the other fails here.
 *
 * ── Directions ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Reverting either site's guard to its former `formatDate`-into-a-plain-span
 * spelling turns `THE REPAIR` red at that site (no affordance, no accessible
 * name) while leaving `THE COMPATIBILITY CLAIM` green — the text is a dash
 * either way, which is precisely why a text-only pin could never have caught
 * this defect and why these cases read the DOM instead.
 *
 * `LIVE CONTROL` is what stops this file passing over a harness that rendered
 * nothing: a populated value must still render its formatted face and must
 * NOT carry the affordance. An empty container fails it.
