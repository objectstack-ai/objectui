ObjectUI follows the **Universal Adapter Pattern**. UI components do not hardcode transport details. They receive a `DataSource` implementation from `SchemaRendererProvider` and call a stable CRUD/query contract.

This keeps the renderer backend-agnostic: ObjectStack, REST, GraphQL, and proprietary backends can all be adapted behind the same interface.

## The Interface

The canonical interface lives in `@object-ui/types`:

```typescript
import type { BatchTransactionOperation, QueryParams, QueryResult } from '@object-ui/types';

export interface DataSource<T = unknown> {
  find(resource: string, params?: QueryParams): Promise<QueryResult<T>>;
  findOne(resource: string, id: string | number, params?: QueryParams): Promise<T | null>;
  create(resource: string, data: Partial<T>): Promise<T>;
  update(
    resource: string,
    id: string | number,
    data: Partial<T>,
    opts?: { ifMatch?: string },
  ): Promise<T>;
  delete(
    resource: string,
    id: string | number,
    opts?: { ifMatch?: string },
  ): Promise<boolean>;

  // Optional: atomically persist an ordered set of cross-object operations
  // (master-detail save). `{ $ref: <op index> }` links a child to a parent
  // created earlier in the same batch. Adapters without server-side atomicity
  // may emulate it — see below.
  batchTransaction?(
    operations: BatchTransactionOperation[],
  ): Promise<{ results: any[] }>;

  getObjectSchema(objectName: string): Promise<unknown>;
}
```

`find()` returns a `QueryResult<T>` so components can receive both rows and pagination metadata:

```typescript
interface QueryResult<T = unknown> {
  data: T[];
  total?: number;
  page?: number;
  pageSize?: number;
  hasMore?: boolean;
  cursor?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

## Available Adapters

### ObjectStack Adapter (Official)

Use `@object-ui/data-objectstack` for ObjectStack-compatible backends.

```bash
pnpm add @object-ui/data-objectstack
```

```typescript
import { createObjectStackAdapter } from '@object-ui/data-objectstack';

const dataSource = createObjectStackAdapter({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.your-instance.com'
});
```

## Usage

Inject the data source at the renderer boundary:

```tsx
import '@object-ui/components';
import '@object-ui/fields';
import { SchemaRenderer, SchemaRendererProvider } from '@object-ui/react';
import { createObjectStackAdapter } from '@object-ui/data-objectstack';
import type { BaseSchema } from '@object-ui/types';

const dataSource = createObjectStackAdapter({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com'
});

const mySchema: BaseSchema = { type: 'table', objectName: 'users' };

function App() {
  return (
    <SchemaRendererProvider dataSource={dataSource}>
      <SchemaRenderer schema={mySchema} />
    </SchemaRendererProvider>
  );
}
```

## Creating a Custom Adapter

If you have a proprietary backend, wrap its SDK or client in a `DataSource` implementation. Keep transport details in the adapter, not in renderers.

```typescript
import type { DataSource, QueryParams, QueryResult } from '@object-ui/types';

type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type BackendClient = {
  listUsers(params?: QueryParams): Promise<{ rows: User[]; total?: number }>;
  getUser(id: string | number): Promise<User | null>;
  createUser(data: Partial<User>): Promise<User>;
  updateUser(id: string | number, data: Partial<User>): Promise<User>;
  deleteUser(id: string | number): Promise<boolean>;
  describeObject(name: string): Promise<unknown>;
};

class UserDataSource implements DataSource<User> {
  constructor(private readonly client: BackendClient) {}

  async find(resource: string, params?: QueryParams): Promise<QueryResult<User>> {
    if (resource !== 'users') {
      return { data: [], total: 0 };
    }

    const result = await this.client.listUsers(params);
    return {
      data: result.rows,
      total: result.total,
    };
  }

  findOne(_resource: string, id: string | number): Promise<User | null> {
    return this.client.getUser(id);
  }

  create(_resource: string, data: Partial<User>): Promise<User> {
    return this.client.createUser(data);
  }

  update(_resource: string, id: string | number, data: Partial<User>): Promise<User> {
    return this.client.updateUser(id, data);
  }

  delete(_resource: string, id: string | number): Promise<boolean> {
    return this.client.deleteUser(id);
  }

  getObjectSchema(objectName: string): Promise<unknown> {
    return this.client.describeObject(objectName);
  }
}
```

## Query Parameters

ObjectUI uses OData-style query keys for broad compatibility:

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — continues the adapter block above: dataSource is the adapter created there, and repeating its construction here would bury the query keys this section is about -->
```typescript
await dataSource.find('users', {
  $select: ['id', 'name', 'email'],
  $filter: { status: 'active' },
  $orderby: { name: 'asc' },
  $skip: 0,
  $top: 25,
  $count: true,
});
```

Data-aware plugins may also use optional methods such as `batchTransaction`, `bulkUpdate`, `bulkDelete`, `getView`, or `listViewOverrides` when an adapter supports them. Keep the required CRUD methods implemented first, then add optional capabilities as your UI needs them.

### Cross-object atomic writes (`batchTransaction`)

Master-detail saves (a parent record plus its child line items) go through
`dataSource.batchTransaction(operations)` — one ordered list of cross-object
create/update/delete operations, where a child's foreign key can be
`{ $ref: <parent op index> }` to point at a parent created in the same batch.
The `@object-ui/data-objectstack` adapter maps this to the published
`@objectstack/client` `data.batchTransaction` SDK method, which drives the
server's atomic `POST /api/v1/batch` endpoint (commit-all-or-roll-back-all).
Adapters without a
transactional endpoint don't need to hand-write orchestration: call
`emulateBatchTransaction(dataSource, operations)` from `@object-ui/core`, which
executes the operations sequentially (resolving `$ref`s) with best-effort
compensation on failure. UI components never branch on atomicity — they call
`runBatchTransaction(dataSource, operations)` (also from `@object-ui/core`),
which uses the adapter's method when present and emulates otherwise.

The `@object-ui/data-objectstack` adapter decides whether it can trust server
atomicity **declaratively**, at connect time: it reads the
`capabilities.transactionalBatch` flag from `GET /api/v1/discovery`
(framework #3298). When the backend advertises `true`, the adapter treats any
`/batch` failure as a real error — no non-atomic client-side compensation. When
the flag is `false` or absent (a backend predating #3298), it keeps the legacy
behaviour: probe `/batch` and fall back to the non-atomic emulation on
`404`/`405`/`501`. Atomic cross-object saves are therefore guaranteed only
against backends that advertise the capability; older ones still save, but
best-effort. See the
[adapter README](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectui/blob/main/packages/data-objectstack/README.md#cross-object-atomic-batch-batchtransaction)
for the full capability table and minimum-backend note.

## Per-element data binding on a page (`dataSource`)

A metadata page component carries its own data binding —
`PageComponentSchema.dataSource`, the spec's `ElementDataSourceSchema` — so one
page can show several objects without a page-level object context:

```json
{
  "type": "list-view",
  "dataSource": { "object": "account", "view": "hot", "limit": 10 }
}
```

This is metadata, **not** the data-source adapter. The two share a name and are
different things: the adapter is injected by the host (`SchemaRendererProvider`),
while `dataSource` on a schema node is JSON describing *what to query*. A
renderer therefore reads the binding off `schema.dataSource` and gets its adapter
from context — never from a prop the schema could occupy. `SchemaRenderer` strips
the binding from the props it spreads for exactly this reason.

`view` names a **saved view** of that object; its columns, filter, sort and page
size are applied to the render, so a page never has to keep a second copy of a
view's configuration. `filter` is *additional* criteria — it AND-combines with the
view's filter rather than replacing it — while `sort` and `limit` override the
view's. Only a usable `limit` overrides: a binding cap the contract refuses (`0`,
a negative, a non-integer) is treated as not authored and yields to the view's
cap exactly as an absent one would, and the view's cap is held to the same rule. A `view` name that does not resolve is reported as a configuration error;
it never degrades into an unfiltered query for the object.

`@object-ui/react` exposes `useElementDataSource(schema, dataSource?)` for
renderers that need the same resolution, and `@object-ui/core` exposes the pure
parts (`isElementDataSourceConfig`, `resolveSavedView`,
`composeElementDataSource`).

### Which blocks consume it, and which keys each one honours

The binding is declared on every page component, but a component can only honour
the keys it has a read site for — a calendar has no page to cap, a metric is one
aggregated number, a form edits one record. Each block therefore maps the keys it
reads and leaves the rest alone; a key written onto a schema slot the block
ignores would be accepted and dropped, which is the defect this binding removes.

| block | `object` | `view` | `filter` | `sort` | `limit` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `list-view` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `object-grid` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `element:record_picker` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `record:related_list` | ✅ | columns / filter / sort / limit | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `object-calendar` | ✅ | filter / sort | ✅ | ✅ | — platform ceiling |
| `object-kanban` | ✅ | filter / limit | ✅ | — no ordering | ✅ (`limit`) |
| `object-chart` | ✅ | filter | ✅ | — engine orders | — no page |
| `object-metric` | ✅ | filter | ✅ | — single value | — single value |
| `object-gantt` | ✅ | filter / sort | ✅ | ✅ | — platform ceiling |
| `object-map` | ✅ | filter / sort | ✅ | ✅ | — platform ceiling |
| `object-pivot` | ✅ | filter | ✅ | — grouping orders | — totals need all rows |
| `object-timeline` | ✅ | filter / sort / limit | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (`limit`) |
| `object-form` | ✅ | error-checked only | — no collection query | — | — |
| `embeddable-form` | ✅ | error-checked only | — no collection query | — | — |
| `object-master-detail-form` | ✅ | error-checked only | — no collection query | — | — |
| `record:line_items` | ✅ (`childObject`) | filter / sort / limit | ✅ (AND parent scope) | ✅ | ✅ (`limit`) |

Reading the `view` column: it lists what a named saved view actually contributes
on that block. A view name that does not resolve is reported as a configuration
error on **every** block in the table, including the ones that take nothing else
from the view — so a typo never passes silently, whatever the block.

Reading the `object` column: it lands on the block's own object key, which is
`objectName` everywhere except `record:line_items`, where the collection the panel
lists, fetches and writes is `childObject`. Its `relationshipField` is *not* part
of the binding and stays the author's — it has to name a field on the bound child
object, so rebinding `object` without updating it is an authoring error the panel
cannot paper over.

On `record:related_list` and `record:line_items` the composed filter is
AND-combined with the parent relationship condition, never substituted for it: a
child panel is always scoped to the record it appears on, and an *additional*
criterion can only narrow that set further. (Until objectstack#7118
`record:related_list` declared `filter` without reading it, so a named view
contributed its columns / sort / limit while its filter was dropped — the list
could be wider than the view it named. That gap is closed; the `filter` cell above
is what closed it.)

`object-timeline` and `record:line_items` were the two residual gaps in this table
until objectstack#7137. Neither had a `filter` / `sort` read site at all — the
timeline's whole fetch was `find(objectName, { options: { $top: 100 } })` and the
line-items panel's was the parent FK plus a fixed `$top: 500` — so a `view` named
on either resolved (a typo reported) and then contributed nothing: the rendered
rows could be **wider than the view they named**, with no error anywhere. Both now
read `filter`, `sort` and `limit`, so the cells above are ✅. Two notes on what
came with that:

- The timeline's default window is `limit ?? 100` and it is now a real `$top`.
  The old `{ options: { $top: 100 } }` nested the cap under a key that is not a
  `QueryParams` field and that no adapter in this repo reads, so the intended cap
  never reached the wire; a timeline over a large object fetched whatever the
  server chose to return. Authoring `limit` (or a view's `pagination.pageSize`)
  now sets it.
- `record:line_items` still does **not** take a view's `columns`: they are editable
  `GridColumn` objects (`{ field, type, … }`) rather than a field-name projection,
  so a view's column list would be the wrong *shape*, not merely a wider answer.

`object-kanban` carried the same nesting, and until objectui#4025 this table read
`— fixed window` in its `limit` cell. There was no window: the board's cap was
written `{ options: { $top: 100 } }` — `$filter` at the top level where the
adapters read it, the cap one level down under a key that is not a `QueryParams`
field — so a board over a large object fetched every row the server would return
and grouped all of it into lanes, client-side. The cap is now a real `$top`,
defaulting to 100, and the `limit` cell is ✅ because the read site exists: a
`limit` authored on the block, the binding's `limit`, or the named view's
`pagination.pageSize` all set it. The board's `sort` cell still reads `— no
ordering` — lanes come from `groupBy` and the fetch declares no `$orderby`, so
mapping `sort` would be the accepted-and-dropped defect one block over.

Note the two `limit`s on a board are different keys at different levels: the row
cap above is `limit` on the **board**, while `limit` on a **column** is that
lane's WIP limit (how many cards it may hold before it warns), which is display
behaviour and never touches the query.

Reading `— platform ceiling` on `object-calendar` / `object-gantt` / `object-map`
(and on `object-tree`, which predates this table): those four are the **non-grid**
visualisations, and objectui#7210's maintainer ruling settled what their row
behaviour is. They fetch the whole **filtered** result set — a gantt cannot
compute a truthful `min(start) → max(end)` from one page, a map fits its camera to
every marker, and a tree assembled from a page loses every node whose parent fell
outside it — but the fetch is **bounded** by `NON_GRID_ROW_CEILING`
(`@object-ui/react`, currently 2,000). Past it the view draws the first N rows and
shows a footnote naming both N and the total. Silent truncation is the failure
that ruling exists to prevent: a cut-off schedule still looks like a schedule.

The `limit` cell stays "not ✅" for all four because the ceiling is **not
authorable and must not become one** — a named constant in the renderer, by the
same ruling. An authored `limit`, a binding's `limit` and a named view's
`pagination.pageSize` all still fail to reach these queries, which is what the
cell has always meant. What changed is only that "no cap at all" is no longer
true.

Remaining gap, recorded rather than papered over:

- `object-form` / `embeddable-form` / `object-master-detail-form` resolve `view`
  only to report an unresolvable name; a view that does resolve contributes
  nothing, because a list view's columns are not a form layout. On the
  master-detail form the bound object is the **parent**; child collections come
  from `details[]`, by FK.

Blocks not in the table (`dashboard`, the other `record:*` panels) do not consume
the binding yet.
