 * The ONE read point for a `record:*` block's `aria` bag (objectui#9556)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The protocol declares an `aria` bag on every `record:*` block this package
 * renders a container for, and `@object-ui/types` mirrors it as
 * {@link RecordComponentAriaProps}. Before objectui#9556 the family read it in
 * three different ways at once, which is what made an authored accessible name
 * a coin flip:
 *
 *   - five containers read NOTHING, so a spec-valid `aria` was accepted at
 *     publish and dropped at render — the author got a success receipt for an
 *     accessibility declaration that reached no user;
 *   - `record:path` read ONLY `aria.label`, the one spelling the shared ARIA
 *     shape refuses, so the spec-valid `aria.ariaLabel` was the value it threw
 *     away;
 *   - `record:quick_actions` read `ariaLabel ?? label` (objectui#4663). This
 *     module applies its CANONICAL half to all of them; the alias half was
 *     retired by objectui#9945 (see below).
 *
 * ⛔ This module does not write down which blocks declare the bag, nor which
 * member spellings the shape accepts. Both are re-derived from the installed
 * `@objectstack/spec` artifact on every run by
 * `__tests__/recordComponentAria-9556.test.tsx` (AGENTS.md #9).
 *
 * ## Why an authored name needs a ROLE to go with it
 *
 * `aria-label` on a bare `div` reaches nobody: a `div` is `generic`, and
 * browsers expose no accessible name on a generic element. `record:path`'s own
 * history is the measured case — `aria-label="Alternative terminal stages"` sat
 * on a `div` and was inert rather than merely untranslated
 * (`record-path.containerLabel.test.tsx` pins the removal). So emitting the
 * attribute alone would have been a change CI calls green and a screen-reader
 * user cannot hear. {@link useRecordAriaProps} therefore emits a role whenever
 * it emits a name.
 *
 * `defaultRole` is each caller's CURRENT role, so a block that renders no
 * `aria` today renders byte-identical DOM: the five containers pass none and
 * stay bare `div`s until an author declares something, `record:path` passes
 * `'list'`, `record:quick_actions` passes `'toolbar'`. The author's own
 * `aria.role` wins over both, which is the precedence `@object-ui/plugin-list`
 * already ships (`ListView`'s `role={schema.aria?.role ?? 'region'}`), and
 * `'region'` is the fallback for the same reason it is ListView's.
 *
 * ## An empty name is no name
 *
 * `||` for the built-in default, as objectui#4663 chose: a declared
 * `ariaLabel: ''` resolves to no name at all, so the block's built-in default
 * wins, which matches `ListView`'s own read point (it emits no `aria-label` for
 * an empty `ariaLabel`).
 *
 * ## ⛔ The refused `aria.label` spelling is REPORTED, never read (objectui#9945)
 *
 * `label` is the shared ARIA shape's alias entry: refused on parse, declared
 * on no authoring face, in no registry `inputs` list and not on
 * {@link RecordComponentAriaProps}. Two renderers used to fold it in behind
 * the canonical spelling as back-compat for documents written before the
 * contract closed: `record:path`, which read it and nothing else before
 * objectui#9556, and `record:quick_actions`, which objectui#4663 gave the fold.
 * Ruling `5749677059` on objectui#9945 retired that fold under the standing
 * rule that a deprecated alias retires at once, with no staged window unless a
 * named external user needs one. So this module reads `aria.ariaLabel` and
 * nothing else, on every block. One strict contract, no second dialect
 * (AGENTS.md #0.1).
 *
 * The ruling also made the retirement LOUD. A stored document that names one
 * of those two blocks with `aria.label` alone used to be announced by that
 * name, and now announces the block's default name. That is a change a screen-reader
 * user hears and an author cannot see. So when the caller names its block (the
 * `block` option), a served `aria.label` gets one `console.warn` naming the
 * block and the canonical spelling. This is the channel this package already
 * uses for a declaration the spec refuses and the block ignores: the row-cap
 * refusal (`describeRefusedFeedLimit`, objectui#9925 / objectui#10097). It
 * fires from an effect keyed on the message, never from render, so a re-render
 * with the same bag says nothing a second time.
 *
 * `record:path` and `record:quick_actions` pass `block`, because only those
 * two ever read the spelling in a release, so only there does a stored
 * document's name change. The other five blocks never read it in a release
 * (objectui#9935, as merged, kept the fold off them), and objectui#9945 keeps
 * them out of its scope. The refusal on every block is pinned by
 * `__tests__/recordComponentAria-9556.test.tsx`; the default name and the
 * report on those two by `__tests__/recordAriaLabelRetired-9945.test.tsx`.
