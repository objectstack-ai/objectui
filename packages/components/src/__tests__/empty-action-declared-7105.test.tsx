/**
 * `EmptySchema.action` is DECLARED, MIRRORED, ADVERTISED — and enforced exactly
 * as declared (objectui#7105).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `empty` has rendered an `action` node, and `content/docs/components/feedback/
 * empty.mdx` has documented it, for a long time. Four surfaces disagreed:
 *
 *   * `EmptySchema` (TypeScript) declared `type` / `title` / `description` /
 *     `icon` and no `action`;
 *   * `feedback.zod.ts`'s mirror declared the same four;
 *   * the renderer's `registrationMeta.inputs` listed `title` / `description` /
 *     `className`, so the designer could not offer the key either;
 *   * only the docs row said the capability existed.
 *
 * The read compiled because `BaseSchema` ends in `[key: string]: any`, and the
 * renderer spelled it `(schema as any).action` — which is also why
 * objectui#6150's census, scanning for `schema.KEY`, could not see this reader.
 *
 * And the slot was NARROWER than a node slot: the renderer required
 * `typeof actionSchema === 'object'`, so a bare string `action` was silently
 * DROPPED rather than rendered.
 *
 * ## What is pinned here, and why each half is needed
 *
 * Ruled (maintainer, decision batch #69, 2026-09-07): declare `action?:
 * SchemaNode`, mirror it, and RELAX the renderer's guard so declared equals
 * enforced. The ruling names the pin — the shipped demo must compile against the
 * declared type AND a string `action` must render. A pin that proved only the
 * type would be half a pin: it would hold with the object-only guard still in
 * place, which is the exact state this card exists to end.
 *
 * ## Non-vacuity — every assertion below fails on the pre-change tree
 *
 *   * the `Equal` assertion: `EmptySchema['action']` resolved to `any` through
 *     the index signature, and `Equal<any, SchemaNode>` is false;
 *   * `shape` membership: asserted on the mirror's OWN shape, never on parse
 *     acceptance. `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()` and `.extend()` carries that
 *     through, so `action` ALREADY parsed green as an unexamined key — under
 *     passthrough, acceptance cannot tell "declared" from "admitted"
 *     (the form `undeclared-but-consumed-keys-6150.test.ts` established);
 *   * the value control: `{ label: 'x' }` with no `type` was admitted by
 *     passthrough before and is refused by `SchemaNodeSchema` now. This is the
 *     VALUE half — key membership above and value judgement here are two
 *     different facts and are asserted separately;
 *   * the string-renders leg: the behaviour change itself;
 *   * the `inputs` leg: `action` was absent from the registration.
 *
 * The demo is read OFF DISK rather than hand-copied, and the literal the
 * compile-time assertion is written against is checked byte-for-byte against
 * it — so the two cannot drift apart silently.
 *
 * Module-scope import of the renderers, not `beforeAll` (AGENTS.md §测试纪律):
 * registering them is an unbounded module load and must not be billed to a
 * bounded hook timeout.
