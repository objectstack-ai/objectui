/**
 * Arm selection for a failing union (`a5d55472b`).
 *
 * ## What this exists for
 *
 * `safeValidateSchema` runs `AnyComponentSchema`. When it was a `z.union`, a
 * document matching no arm got ONE top-level issue — `invalid_union` · `Invalid
 * input` · `path: []` — with every arm's real diagnosis hung off that issue's
 * `errors` array. `validate.ts` used to print only the top level, so the author
 * got a bare verdict on the whole document even when the schema had diagnosed
 * the defect precisely, remediation text and all. ⚠️ Since objectui#8498 that
 * union discriminates on `type`: the root issue sits at `['type']` when nothing
 * matches and there is no root union issue at all when something does; the shape
 * above still arrives from the undiscriminated unions at nested slots.
 *
 * The 2026-09-02 maintainer ruling chose **B — discriminator-selected arm**:
 * print the issues of the single arm that accepts the authored `type`, and
 * nothing from the others; when no arm accepts it, print a note plus a CAPPED
 * list of the nearest candidate arm names. Printing every arm (option A),
 * picking the arm with the fewest issues (option C) and the status quo (option
 * D) were all rejected.
 *
 * This module performs the SELECTION only. Every `console.*` call stays in
 * `validate.ts`, which remains the repository's only zod-issue printer — so no
 * second rendering surface is created and no shared renderer is warranted.
 *
 * ## Measured facts this rests on (Zod 4.4.3, re-measured on this tree)
 *
 * 1. A union that TRIES EVERY ARM reports `errors`, positionally aligned with
 *    its options: `errors[i]` is option `i`'s issues. Selection here never
 *    relies on that alignment — see (2) — but it is why the arm lists can be
 *    read as arms at all. ⚠️ `AnyComponentSchema` stopped being such a union in
 *    objectui#8498: it discriminates on `type`, so it produces NO `errors` array
 *    at all. This fact now describes the unions that remain undiscriminated —
 *    `MenuItemSchema` and its kind, reached at nested slots — which is where the
 *    fallback at the bottom of `explain` earns its keep.
 * 2. **A union names the literals it accepts.** THREE shapes do it, and (c) is
 *    the one objectui#8498 added — the previous count of two was a totality
 *    claim, and it is restated rather than patched because it went false:
 *      - (a) `invalid_value` at `['type']`, carrying `values: ['app']` — an
 *        object arm whose `type` is a `z.literal`;
 *      - (b) `invalid_union` at `['type']` with `note: 'No matching
 *        discriminator'` and `options: ['div', 'box', …]` — a
 *        `z.discriminatedUnion` sitting as an ARM of a wider union, reporting
 *        relative to its own node;
 *      - (c) the same `invalid_union` · `No matching discriminator` · `options`
 *        issue reported for the union the document was measured against
 *        DIRECTLY, at `[…node, 'type']` — no arms, nothing to select among,
 *        because the discriminator already answered. `AnyComponentSchema` is
 *        this shape now, so it is the shape `objectui validate` meets first.
 *    So the accepted-literal set is still derivable from the error tree ALONE.
 *    This module therefore never imports or introspects the schema, and cannot
 *    drift from it.
 * 3. **Paths inside `errors` are RELATIVE to their union's node.** The nested
 *    union at `['items', 0]` reports its arm issues at `['type']`, not at
 *    `['items', 0, 'type']`. Printing them raw would name the wrong node, so
 *    every path here is rebased onto its parent's prefix.
 * 4. Every leaf arm of `AnyComponentSchema` carries a DISTINCT `type` literal —
 *    no literal is claimed by two arms — so "exactly one arm accepts that
 *    literal" is total and unambiguous at the document root. Stated as a
 *    property and not as a count on purpose: the number of arms moves every
 *    time a component lands, the distinctness does not, and it is the
 *    distinctness the selection rests on.
 *
 * ## The third branch, and why it is not option A
 *
 * The ruling partitions on "exactly one arm accepts" vs "no arm accepts". Both
 * presuppose arms that DECLARE a `type` contract. Not every union has them:
 * `MenuItemSchema` — the union this card was filed about — is a two-arm
 * `z.union` whose arms both declare `type` as an ADR-0049 retirement tombstone
 * (`z.never()`), so neither names a literal and no discriminator exists to
 * select on. Measured: its arms report `invalid_type` (`expected: 'never'`)
 * with no `values`.
 *
 * Routing that to the "no arm accepts" branch would be literally true and
 * exactly wrong: the candidate list would be empty and the objectui#6523
 * remediation text — the very text this card exists to deliver — would be
 * dropped. So a union with NO declaring arm falls back to the ruling's own
 * named fallback, "A with a cap": every arm reported, capped by
 * {@link MAX_UNION_ARMS_REPORTED}. This is not option A at the root, which the
 * ruling rejected on the arm-count noise argument — the root is always
 * discriminated (fact 4), and undiscriminated unions in this mirror are small
 * (`MenuItemSchema` has two arms).

 *
 * Five, from a measurement rather than taste. The candidate set is the union's
 * arm names, and the document root carries far more of them than five, so the
 * cap is the whole distance between a hint and the option A the ruling
 * rejected.
 *
 * Ranking those arm names by edit distance against four authored typos gave the
 * same shape every time: the intended arm is rank 1 and ALONE in its distance
 * band (`dropdwn-menu` -> `dropdown-menu` at 1, one name at that distance;
 * `dropdwon-menu` -> `dropdown-menu` at 2, one name; `Page` -> `page` at 1, one

 * would print the winner with nothing around it and read as a confident answer
 * rather than as a ranked list — the same over-claim
 * `known-type-case-suggestion.ts` refuses on the sibling surface. Five is also
 * the conventional shell and compiler suggestion size and holds one terminal
 * line at these name lengths.

 * select on (see this module's header). Both lists answer the same question —

 * option A was rejected for — so they share one constant rather than inviting a
