/**
 * objectui#6010 — ONE authored `visibleWhen` text, every binding surface, one
 * verdict.
 *
 * The three surfaces ADR-0068 D1 names are page/app-nav, per-option, and form
 * section/field; the table below runs five rows, because "form section/field"
 * is two declarations sharing one call site and because the deprecated
 * `visibleOn` alias is the same key by ADR-0089 D2 and must not become a sixth
 * spelling with a scope of its own.
 *
 * ADR-0068 D1 states the contract this file pins: *"a predicate authored
 * against any one form evaluates identically"* — `current_user` (plus the
 * `user` / `ctx.user` / `os.user` aliases) is the canonical identity root on
 * every runtime record surface, and ADR-0089 D1 repeats it from the naming
 * side (*"runtime record surfaces bind `record` + `current_user`"*).
 *
 * It was true on two surfaces and false on the third. `ExpressionProvider`
 * builds the scope; `SchemaRenderer` consumed it for a page/app-nav node, and
 * `form.tsx` forwarded it to `resolveCascadingOptions` for per-option
 * `visibleWhen` — but every `resolveFieldRuleState` call passed `undefined`,
 * so a form SECTION or FIELD predicate saw `record` and `previous` and nothing
 * else. `'sales_manager' in current_user.positions` therefore named an UNBOUND
 * root there, and `resolveFieldRuleState` passes `true` as the visibility
 * fallback — so the gate did not hide the field from the people it named, it
 * showed the field to EVERYONE. Fail-open in the dangerous direction, silent
 * except for one deduped console line.
 *
 * ## Why a parity file and not three per-surface assertions
 *
 * The defect exists precisely because two of three surfaces got the scope and
 * one did not. No pin that looks at a single surface can express "they agree";
 * only a table that runs the SAME predicate text through all of them can. That
 * is the deliverable here — the argument change in `form.tsx` is not.
 *
 * ## The three cases, and why the second one is the important one
 *
 * Each surface is asked the same three questions:
 *
 *   1. **DENIED** — the predicate evaluates and resolves FALSE ⇒ hidden.
 *   2. **ALLOWED** — the same predicate text, a user it admits ⇒ still SHOWN.
 *      This is the counter-probe, and it is the half that matters: "the
 *      predicate is now evaluated" is otherwise satisfiable by hiding
 *      everything, which is a worse bug than fail-open and is completely
 *      invisible to case 1 on its own.
 *   3. **FAULTED** — a predicate naming a genuinely unbound root ⇒ still
 *      SHOWN. Fail-open is EXISTING behaviour that #6010 does not change, and
 *      pinning it is what keeps case 1 meaningful: without it, "hidden" and
 *      "the root is not bound" are the same observation. With it, the file
 *      distinguishes *evaluated-and-false* from *faulted*.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted BEFORE running)
 *
 * Revert the `scope` argument on ONE of the three `resolveFieldRuleState` call
 * sites and the DENIED row for that surface — and only that surface — goes
 * red, in the SHOWN direction (the element starts rendering again), because
 * the fallback is fail-open. The ALLOWED and FAULTED rows stay green
 * everywhere, on every surface, which is exactly why case 1 alone would not
 * have caught the regression's shape.

 *
 * ⚠️ It is also the only shape in which this comparison is about the SCOPE.
 * Measured while writing this file: a BARE STRING carrying the CEL membership
 * operator is not portable across the surfaces, and for a reason that has
 * nothing to do with `current_user`. The form renderer treats a bare string as
 * CEL (`fieldRules.ts`'s `toExpression` defaults `dialect` to `'cel'`), while
 * `SchemaRenderer` routes it to the LEGACY expression engine, which has no `in`
 * operator and rejects it — *"Unexpected token \"i\" at position 16"* — then
 * fails open. Pinning the bare string here would therefore have compared two
 * dialects and read the difference as a scope difference. Dual-dialect routing
 * is existing, documented behaviour on the node gate; it is not #6010 and is

 * ⛔ No `data` (objectui#8166) and no `app` (objectui#8155). A transcription

 * The aliases are not decoration — `SchemaRenderer` re-derives

 * would gate correctly on the two form surfaces and NOT on the page one, which
