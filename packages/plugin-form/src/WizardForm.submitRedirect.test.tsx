 *
 * What `WizardForm` DOES with a declared `submitBehavior: { kind: 'redirect' }`
 * (objectui#4989) — the wizard half of `ObjectForm.submitRedirect.test.tsx`.
 *
 * Both components consume the ruled key through the SAME module
 * (`submitRedirect.ts`), so the value-level verdicts are pinned once, in
 * `submitRedirect.test.ts`, against the spec's own schema. Two component files
 * exist anyway because the card filed the defect at two call sites and each has
 * its own terminal-state rendering: a wizard's refusal has to replace a STEP form
 * (with its footer Create button living outside the `<form>`), and a shared module
 * cannot prove that either call site actually reaches it. Deleting one call site
 * leaves the unit file entirely green, which is exactly why the consumption is
 * pinned per component.
 *
 * **Defect 4 (mount-blindness) is fixed separately**, by the optional injected
 * navigation seam ruled on 2026-08-17 and pinned in
 * `submitRedirect.injectedNavigation.test.tsx` (which covers this component
 * too). No host provider is mounted here — a supported state, and the one that
 * keeps `window.location.assign` — so these tests assert the string it receives
 * and double as the pin on that fallback being unchanged.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification — predicted first, then measured (counts are measured)
 *
 * See `ObjectForm.submitRedirect.test.tsx` for the full account; the numbers for
 * this file:
 *
 * 1. **Restoring the old same-origin guard around the old assign**
 *    (`isSameOriginUrl(behavior.url)`; the helper was deleted by objectui#5034,
 *    so the mutation is now spelled inline): **6 of
 *    the 7 tests go RED**, the survivor being `navigates to a ruled relative
 *    path` — behaviour the old line also had. The same-origin-absolute test fails
 *    on the assign (the old guard answers yes and navigates — defect 3); the
 *    protocol-relative test fails on the refusal being absent (defect 2's
 *    silence); the interpolation tests fail because the old line assigned the
 *    authored string with its braces intact.
 * 2. **Deleting only the refusal arm**, keeping the parse: **exactly the 3 tests
 *    in the refusal block go red**, all 4 in-contract tests stay green.
 * 3. **Replacing the spec's refusal with a local sentence**: the 2 refusal tests
 *    asserting the spec's wording go red (18 red overall across the three files).
 * 4. **Deleting the `encodeURIComponent`**: `escapes an interpolated value into
 *    one segment` goes red here (10 red overall).

/**
 * A refusal CITES THE RULING it comes from, in either spelling the spec uses.
 *
 * This is the assertion that proves the sentence on screen is the live schema
 * parse's and not a local hand-written string (mutation probe 3 below). It was
 * spelled `toContain('#7496')` and pinned the citation FORM: `@objectstack/spec`
 * 17.3.0 restated the same provenance as `(ruled 2026-08-11)`, so the token
 * vanished while the refusal, its reasoning and its prescription all stayed.
 * ⛔ Not re-pinned to the new prose verbatim — that moves the brittleness
 * instead of removing it.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why there is no bare `#\d{3,}` alternative any more
 *
 * The first spelling of this regex was
 * `/\(ruled \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\)|#\d{3,}/` — two alternatives, to admit
 * either form upstream uses. The loose half discriminated NOTHING
 * (objectui#7122 contract review): this repo's own hand-written messages
 * routinely cite `objectui#NNNN`, so a locally authored sentence satisfied it,
 * and telling those two apart is this assertion's entire job. Only the
 * `(ruled …)` half was ever load-bearing.
 *
 * It was also unnecessary, which is the measurement that settled it. Both
 * spellings, read off the installed artifacts rather than recalled:
 *
 *   17.2.0  "… and this is an absolute URL (ruled 2026-08-11 on #7496)."
 *   17.3.0  "… and this is an absolute URL (ruled 2026-08-11)."
 *
 * The issue number never appears OUTSIDE that parenthesis, so `(ruled ` + a
 * date already matched both releases on its own. The optional ` on #NNNN` tail
 * keeps the 17.2.0 spelling admissible — the two-form latitude the alternative
 * was added for — without admitting a bare local `#7122`.
