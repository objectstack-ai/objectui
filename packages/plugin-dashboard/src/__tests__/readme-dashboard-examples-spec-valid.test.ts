/**
 * Every dashboard example on this package's front page must survive the SHIPPED
 * contract — `@object-ui/types/zod`'s `DashboardComponentSchema`, the same
 * schema `objectui validate` runs.
 *
 * ## The hole this closes (objectui#7035)
 *
 * The README taught two widgets spelled `type: 'card'` with a nested `body`.
 * `'card'` is not a member of `DashboardWidgetTypeName` — the vocabulary
 * objectui#4600 closed — so `DashboardComponentSchema.safeParse` refused the
 * whole document, and a reader who copied the block got a rejection. Three
 * gates were green on it the whole time, each for a stated reason:
 *
 *   - `check:doc-snippets` compiles fenced `ts` against the built `dist/`, and
 *     these blocks are untyped `const schema = { … }` literals, so nothing was
 *     annotated for tsc to refuse. Its own header names schema-key validity as
 *     the question it does NOT answer.
 *   - `check:doc-types` asks whether a `type` literal names a REGISTERED
 *     component, and its surface is `content/docs/**` plus the root README —
 *     package READMEs are outside it. (`card` is registered anyway; what
 *     rejected the widget was the widget vocabulary, not the registry.)
 *   - `check:readme-exports` judges import bindings, not metadata literals.
 *
 * So the one question nobody was asking is the one this file asks: does the
 * example still validate. It is deliberately narrow — this document only.
 *
 * ## Why the blocks are evaluated rather than parsed as JSON
 *
 * They are TypeScript object literals with comments and trailing prose, not
 * JSON. Evaluating them is what keeps this test reading the BYTES a reader
 * copies instead of a hand-maintained twin that drifts from the page.
 *
 * A block this harness cannot evaluate FAILS — it is never skipped. An
 * unexaminable block that reads as a clean one is the failure shape the doc
 * gate family exists to prevent (objectui#4846), and the fix when a new block
 * needs an ambient name is to add it to `AMBIENT` below, deliberately.
 *
 * `plugin-gantt`'s `readme-navigation-example.test.ts` is the same idea one
 * package over — its README's `json` fence against the shipped navigation
 * schema — so this is that pattern applied here, not a new one.
