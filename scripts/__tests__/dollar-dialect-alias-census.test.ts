/**
 * Pins for `scripts/dollar-dialect-alias-census.mjs` (objectui#8568).
 *
 * Every assertion below corresponds to a way this instrument can lie, and all
 * but one of them lie in the SAME DIRECTION: an alias the scanner cannot see is
 * an alias the census reports as absent, with exit 0 and no error — and the
 * number it prints is the one the maintainer is being asked to price a BREAKING
 * change against. A confident zero is the expensive failure here.
 *
 * The one that lies in the other direction is the sibling dialect. Counting a
 * `FILTER_OPERATOR_ALIASES` row as `$`-dialect reliance would make option 1
 * look expensive for filters option 1 does not touch, which is the mirror-image
 * mistake and just as decision-breaking.
 *
 * Five groups, failing for five different reasons:
 *
 * 1. THE DERIVATION. The alias set comes out of the map and the spec, so a
 *    changed map changes the census. A regression here silently freezes the
 *    census on a dialect the code no longer speaks.
 * 2. THE SYNTAXES. One case per shape an author can write. A regression here
 *    shrinks the population without changing what was scanned.
 * 3. THE CONFLATION GUARD. Case-sensitivity and the `$` requirement, which are
 *    the two things separating this dialect from the tolerant sibling one.
 * 4. THE CLASSIFICATION. Payload vs mention, and role by path — the axes that
 *    stop a flat total from reading as adoption.
 * 5. THE CONTROLS AND THE TREE. The controls must be capable of failing, and
 *    the tree as it stands today must still satisfy them.
