/**
 * objectui#8755 — a `dependsOn` LOOKUP param on the BULK action dialog gates,
 * UNGATES, and filters, exactly as the option params beside it already did.
 *
 * The twin of `app-shell/src/views/ActionParamDialog.lookupDependsOnReach-8672.test.tsx`
 * at the third and last surface that reads `CASCADE_OPTION_WIDGET_TYPES`.
 *
 * ## What was broken, and why it is NOT a new authoring route
 *
 * `BulkActionDialog`'s `ParamField` threaded its in-progress `values` to the
 * OPTION widgets only (`select` / `multiselect` / `radio` / `checkboxes`, the
 * members of `CASCADE_OPTION_WIDGET_TYPES`, supplied since objectui#4757). A
 * `lookup` param is in none of those, so `LookupField` fell through to the
 * `SchemaRendererContext` tail that objectui#7206 measured as unconditionally
 * `{}` — unsettable, not merely unset — `dependenciesMissing` could never
 * clear, and the trigger rendered DISABLED FOREVER, prompting for the very
 * param the user had just filled.
 *
 * ⭐ The load-bearing measurement is `leg A / already-live`: the SAME key, on
 * the SAME surface, arriving through the SAME route, has always been honoured
 * for the option family. `bulkParamToField` does not destructure `dependsOn`
 * out, so it rides `...extra` onto the field bag, and `SelectField` /
 * `RadioField` read `field.dependsOn` through `useCascadingOptions`. So this
 * change introduces no key, no spelling and no route — it stops one of the two
 * widget families that both read `dependsOn` here from reading it into a dead
 * control. Retiring the key instead (ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove, the other
 * disposition this card offered) would have deleted a shipping capability.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ And it is NOT licensed by the bulk param schema — leg B says so
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s `BulkActionParamSchema` "accepts" `dependsOn`. That
 * accept is a NULL READING: leg B fires a nonsense key at the same schema in
 * the same run and it is accepted too, so the schema refuses nothing and its
 * acceptance authorises nothing. The strict sibling `ActionParamSchema` refuses
 * both. ⛔ Nobody may cite the bulk schema's accept as evidence that the key is
 * authorable — that inference is the trap this card was filed to close, and leg
 * B is here so it fails loudly rather than being re-derived.
 *
 * ## Every reading has a lit control beside it
 *
 * - leg A pairs the subject with a CONTROL lookup identical but for `dependsOn`
 *   (enabled throughout), with a KEYSTROKE WITNESS whose option set re-resolves
 *   on the same keystroke — so "the gate lifted" is read against a keystroke
 *   proven to have reached the dialog — and with a NEGATIVE control that an
 *   empty parent still gates, so the fix cannot be read as "the gate was
 *   deleted";
 * - leg B pairs every refusal and every accept with a positive control document
 *   that must PARSE and a nonsense-key document whose verdict is the strictness
 *   reading itself;
 * - leg C reads both families in both directions;
 * - leg D offers two records under one reference and asserts the declared param
 *   sees one while the control param sees both — so a narrowed list cannot be a
 *   picker that simply failed to load.
