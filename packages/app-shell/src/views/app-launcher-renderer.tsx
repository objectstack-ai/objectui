/**
 * `app:launcher` — the app launcher grid, addressable from a page schema
 * (`969ba84f4`).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `app:launcher` is a first-class member of `@objectstack/spec`'s
 * `PageComponentType`. The maintainer ruling of 2026-08-26 (objectstack#12183)
 * kept it declared and made it Phase 1 of the decomposition precisely because
 * it is PURELY METADATA-DRIVEN: the app list is metadata the shell already
 * holds, so nothing had to ship before the renderer could. Nothing rendered it,
 * so a page that authored it drew a dashed box.
 *
 * ⚠️ The two Phase 1 members were NOT symptomatic in the same way, which is
 * worth recording because it changes what "before" means for each. Measured on
 * `592acafbe`, in a harness that imports `@object-ui/components` and nothing
 * else:
 *
 *   - `nav:menu` is in `PALETTE_PLACEHOLDER_BLOCKS`, registered EAGERLY, so it
 *     drew `PlaceholderRenderer`'s literal "Component Placeholder" scaffold in
 *     every host;
 *   - `app:launcher` is only in `PROTOCOL_COMPONENTS`, registered solely when a
 *     host opts in via `registerPlaceholders()` — which just `apps/console`
 *     does (`apps/console/src/main.tsx:53`). So it drew the scaffold in the
 *     console (which is what objectstack#12183 measured in a browser) and
 *     `SchemaRenderer`'s red OBJUI-001 "Unknown component type" panel
 *     everywhere else.
 *
 * ## What backs it — nothing new
 *
 * The app registry: `useMetadata().apps`, which `MetadataProvider` fetches
 * eagerly (`app` is in its `EAGER_TYPES`, i.e. `GET /api/v1/meta/app` on
 * mount). That is the SAME read the top-bar `AppSwitcher` and the Home page
 * make, and the openable-apps filter is the shared `filterActiveApps` helper
 * rather than a second copy of the `active`/`hidden` rule. This is the ruling's
 * "no external data-source dependency" claim, discharged: the block issues no
 * request of its own and reaches no adapter.
 *
 * The grid itself is `HomeAppsStrip` — the console's existing launcher, already
 * the answer to "how does this product draw a wall of apps" — so an authored
 * launcher and the Home launcher cannot drift into two looks for one thing.
 *
 * ## Declared propless, deliberately
 *
 * `ComponentPropsMap['app:launcher']` is an EMPTY shape ("declares no props at
 * all" is the recorded intent), so this registration publishes NO `inputs`.
 * Declaring even `className` here would advertise an authoring key the contract
 * rejects by name — the forward direction of
 * `apps/console/src/__tests__/registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts` is a vice on
 * exactly that move. The node-level `className` the SchemaRenderer threads
 * through is a NODE key (`PageComponentSchema`), not a prop.
 *
 * One consequence of propless-ness worth stating rather than leaving implicit:
 * `HomeAppsStrip`'s marketplace shortcut is gated on `isAdmin`, and this block
 * passes `false`. Installing a template is a Home-page/admin affordance, and
 * with an empty prop shape there is no authoring key that could ever turn it on
 * — so wiring the admin probe here would publish behaviour no author can
 * address, describe or disable.
 *
 * Registered in app-shell rather than `@object-ui/components` for the same
 * reason `global:search` is (`f99932a42`): the providers are here.
 * `@object-ui/components` depends on neither `@object-ui/layout` nor
 * `react-router-dom` (measured against its `package.json` on `592acafbe`), and
 * this block needs the router to open an app. The eager palette placeholder in
 * `components/renderers/placeholders.tsx` STAYS: it is the fallback for a host
 * that embeds `@object-ui/components` without app-shell, and this module
 * imports that package, so its registration always runs first and this one
 * overwrites it.
 *
 * This does NOT put the block in the Studio page palette: `PALETTE_EXCLUSIONS`
 * still records `app:launcher` as a shell singleton, and that is a palette
 * decision about authoring ergonomics, independent of whether a declared type
 * renders — exactly as `f99932a42` left `global:notifications`.
