/**
 * Setup › Packaged automation (ADR-0126 §7.4) — behaviour.
 *
 * Five properties, in the order the page exercises them:
 *
 *   1. **scope** — the list is packaged flows only. The rule itself lives in
 *      `packagedFlows.ts` and is measured directly in `packagedFlows.test.ts`;
 *      what is checked here is that the rendered page applies it.
 *   2. **round-trip** — flipping the switch calls the toggle route with the
 *      requested state and the shown state follows the SERVER's answer.
 *   3. **refusals, verbatim** — the three shapes this page must relay: the
 *      §5 posture gate (403 `PERMISSION_DENIED`), the §7.3 subflow guard
 *      (409 `DELETE_RESTRICTED`, which NAMES the callers) and the §7.1 clone
 *      name conflict (409). Each is asserted as the exact server string. Two
 *      of the three are transcribed character-for-character from the runtime's
 *      own message builders; what is under test either way is that the page
 *      renders what it was sent, unedited.
 *   4. **clone** — completes with the new name, and puts EXACTLY
 *      `{ name, label }` on the wire. The carried-over definition is not an
 *      editable form field (the #11753 discipline).
 *   5. **no ancestry** — the withdrawn §9 shapes are absent. The sharpest case
 *      is last: even when a response carries a `clonedFrom` key, the page must
 *      not display it. Pinning the rule at the RENDERER and not only at the
 *      wire is the point — a response field is the cheapest place for ancestry
 *      to reappear.
 *   6. **the unbound reason** (objectui#9217) — a runtime row's `reason` is the
 *      platform's sentence for why the flow is not armed. It is shown VERBATIM
 *      and muted, never as an alert, whether it names the deployment policy or
 *      a real binding failure; a row without one renders exactly as before.
