/**
 * objectui#8447 — the OBJECT (`$`-dialect) matcher executes the operators the
 * spec declares, and refuses the rest instead of waving them through.
 *
 * ## The defect these cases have to be able to see
 *
 * `find()` picks its matcher on nothing but the SHAPE of `$filter` — two arms
 * of one `if`. The array arm (`matchesASTFilter`) refuses an unknown node,
 * excludes the row and logs; the object arm (`matchesFilter`) ended its switch
 * with `default: break`, which adds NO constraint, so an unrecognised operator
 * selected EVERY row in silence. Same file, opposite defaults, and nothing
 * tells an author which dialect their filter took.
 *
 * ## Why every case is a non-empty PROPER subset
 *
 * Two wrong implementations have to fail here, not one:
 *
 * 1. **the bug** — no constraint, so the answer is the full set;
 * 2. **the caricature** — a matcher that answers `false` for everything, so the
 *    answer is the empty set. It is strictly WORSE than the bug and it passes
 *    every assertion whose expected value is `[]`.
 *
 * A row-set equality against a non-empty proper subset of `ROW_IDS` is red for
 * both. The refusal cases below, whose expected row set IS empty, therefore
 * carry the `console.warn` assertion as the half that discriminates: the
 * caricature refuses nothing, so it logs nothing.
 *
 * Both were RUN, not reasoned about, and both were RE-RUN after the contract
 * review flipped `$exists` from refused to executed — the survivor list is not
 * carried forward across that edit, because the edit changes the shape of one
 * of the assertions in it:
 *
 * | ablation | red | green | of |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | the bug — `ValueDataSource.ts` restored to its pre-card bytes | 38 | 24 | 62 |
 * | the caricature — `matchesFilter` returns `false` unconditionally | 54 | 8 | 62 |
 *
 * ⚠️ The two counts above are objectui#8447's run against objectui#8447's file,
 * and the denominator has since moved: objectui#8513 rewrote §4 when it made
 * `$and` / `$or` EXECUTE, so this file now holds 66 cases rather than 62. The
 * table is kept as the record of that run — it is what justified the shape of
 * §1-§3 and §5, which #8513 did not touch — and it is ⛔ NOT re-derived here,
 * because re-running an old card's ablation against a new file would replace a
 * true historical measurement with a number that describes neither card. #8513
 * ablated its own change instead; that run is recorded in
 * `ValueDataSource.filterLogicConformance-8513.test.ts`.
 *
 * The eight survivors of the caricature are named rather than counted, because
 * which ones survive is the finding: the two `{}` cases and the AST-group case
 * never reach `matchesFilter` at all, the `FILTER_OPERATORS` parity guard reads
 * no rows, and the remaining FOUR are the card's own `$nin` / `$startsWith` /
 * `$null` / `$exists` examples — the quotable ones, and they cannot tell this
 * fix from an empty result set. They are kept in §5 and labelled as a scope
 * declaration.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The one mover across the flip**, measured rather than predicted:
 * `$exists false selects neither row` was RED under the caricature before the
 * flip and is GREEN after it. Nothing else moved — the red count is 54 in both
 * runs. It discriminated only because it asserted the refusal was LOGGED, and
 * executing the operator removed the log. §5 therefore has no case left that
 * tells the fix from the caricature EXCEPT its last one, which asserts the
 * complement of all four and is four non-empty answers.
 *
 * Assertions name ROWS (`['a','c']`), never a container shape (objectui#8495).
