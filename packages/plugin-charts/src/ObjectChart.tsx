/**
 * The category axis this chart plots BY — resolved ONCE, for every reader.
 *
 * ## Why this is a function and not three inline reads
 *
 * "Which column is the category?" was spelled three times in this file, at
 * three fidelities, and the refusal below would have been a fourth. That is the
 * objectui#5042 / objectui#7544 drift shape — a second opinion of one question
 * that nothing keeps in agreement — and objectui#7544's fix
 * (`resolveListChartBinding` in `plugin-list/src/ListView.tsx`) is the same move
 * one layer up, on the AUTHORED list-view chart block.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is one layer up, not this layer. `resolveListChartBinding` reads
 * `{ chart, options.chart }` with `xAxisField` / `categoryField` / `yAxisFields`
 * — the block an author writes on a LIST VIEW. By the time a schema reaches
 * this component the relays have already translated that block into
 * `{ objectName, aggregate, xAxisKey, series }`, and the producers that never
 * had such a block at all (the two dashboard surfaces, and directly authored
 * `object-chart` metadata) compose the translated shape straight away. So the
 * upstream resolver cannot be CALLED here — asked for `schema.chart` it would
 * read `undefined` off every chart this component renders and answer
 * "unresolvable" for all of them. What is shared is the QUESTION and the rule
 * for answering it; the vocabulary is necessarily this layer's.
 *
 * ## The three legs, in the order the render pipeline applies them
 *
 * 1. A structured `GroupBy` node (`{ field, dateGranularity }`) — its `field`
 *    IS the category, and nothing substitutes for it: `runAggregate` sends the
 *    node itself as the server's `groupBy`, so a node naming no field has no
 *    other spelling that could rescue it.
 * 2. A legacy string `aggregate.groupBy`.
 * 3. Otherwise the chart plots rows as fetched, and the category is whatever
 *    `normalizeChartSchema` — this package's ONE translation of the spec's
 *    author-facing chart shape into the renderer's internal contract — resolves
 *    for the x axis: `xAxisKey`, else spec `xAxis.field`, else a bare string
 *    `xAxis`. Reading `schema.xAxisKey` alone here would have refused a chart
 *    that authored the spec spelling and renders correctly today, because
 *    `ChartRenderer` normalizes DOWNSTREAM of this component.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` only when the schema names no category by any declared
 * spelling — a real answer, and what {@link ObjectChart}'s refusal keys on.
 *
 * ⚠️ LEDGERED, on purpose: this is the one `normalizeChartSchema` call in the
 * package that passes NO language (objectui#8943). It is safe here and only
 * here — the call reads `.xAxisKey`, a COLUMN NAME, and nothing else. No
 * `I18nLabel` slot on the result is ever read through this path, so there is no
 * label for a language to resolve. Keeping the function pure (it is called from
 * plain module scope, outside any component) is worth more than a language
 * argument that would change no byte of its answer. ⛔ If this ever starts
 * reading `title` / `subtitle` / `description` / an axis `title` / a series
 * `label`, it needs the viewer's language and can no longer be called from
 * outside a component.

  // --- Drill-down --------------------------------------------------------
  // Charts can opt into drill-down via `schema.drillDown`. Clicking a bar
  // segment / pie slice opens a Sheet rendering the underlying records,
  // filtered by the click context (category → groupBy field). The drilled
  // table is rendered via SchemaRenderer + the registered "object-data-table"
  // component (provided by plugin-dashboard).
  //
  // This read used to be `(schema as any).drillDown`, and framework#5022 is the
  // issue that untyped read produced: the block drove a real capability that
  // the PROTOCOL declared nowhere, so the spec's own migration prose ended up
  // prescribing a key no schema had. The protocol now declares it —
  // `ChartDrillDownSchema` in `@objectstack/spec/ui`, published on this block's
  // react contract — and the registry `inputs` below carry it, so the SDUI save
  // gate treats it as a contract prop instead of an unknown one.
  //
  // TODO(framework#5022): narrow this to the spec type once the pin advances.
  // `@objectstack/spec` is pinned at `^17.0.0-rc.2` here and the declaration
  // lands in the NEXT rc, so importing `ChartDrillDown` today would not compile
  // against the published package. Re-declaring the shape locally instead is
  // exactly the fork that would let the two drift, so the read stays on
  // `DrillDownConfig` — the renderer-side type five widgets already share —
  // until the bump. Note the two are not the same set on purpose: the spec type
  // is the CHART subset (`enabled`/`filter`/`title`/`target`/`columns`/
  // `maxRows`), while this one also carries the table/pivot/metric keys
  // (`mode`, `report`) that this component does not read.
  //
  // objectui#3354 shrank the gap from the other side: the whole `target` union
  // — including `'navigate'` — is honoured below, and the two keys no renderer
  // read at all (`view`, `sort`) are gone from `DrillDownConfig`.
  //
  // ⚠️ The asymmetry this paragraph used to describe IS GONE, and the correction
  // is recorded rather than quietly deleted because the stale claim outlived the
  // fact by two releases. It said `ChartDrillDownSchema` declares
  // `target: 'drawer' | 'dialog'`, so the protocol's union was narrower than
  // what this renderer delivers and `'navigate'` could not be advertised without
  // colliding with the publish gate. objectstack#5435 extended the union — the
  // spec now declares `['drawer', 'dialog', 'navigate']`
  // (`@objectstack/spec/ui`, `ChartDrillDownSchema.target`), and the publish
  // gate parses that same schema, so it accepts `'navigate'` today.
  //
  // ⇒ What is left is NOT a protocol gap: it is an unmade decision about the
  // designer palette. The `description` on the registry `inputs` below still
  // lists two arms, and `index.test.ts` pins that withholding by name. Widening
  // an advertised authoring vocabulary is a contract decision about `drillDown`,
  // a key objectui#7946 declares on NEITHER published face — it belongs to
  // objectui#8885, which owns `drillDown` there and already records these sites.
  // So this round corrects the false statement and leaves the advertisement
  // alone; see this PR's acceptance notes for the named successor.

  /**
   * objectui#8168 — REFUSE an object-bound chart that declares no category axis.
   *
   * The twin of `ObjectTimeline`'s screen (objectui#7459), which is the settled
   * in-repo shape for this: an object-bound view that names no axis is told so
   * instead of being composed from a name nobody wrote. `ObjectCalendar` and
   * `ObjectGantt` carry the same answer for their own axes. This component was
   * the one of the four with no such screen at all.
   *
   * ## What it replaces
   *
   * `runAggregate` passes `schema.aggregate` to `ds.aggregate(objectName, {
   * field, function, groupBy, filter })` with no guard on `groupBy`, and the
   * `ds.find` leg hands the same bag to `aggregateRecords`, which buckets every
   * record on `record[groupBy] ?? 'Unknown'`. With no category declared, the
   * first asks a driver to group by `undefined` and the second collapses the
   * whole object into one `'Unknown'` bar. Which of those a reader saw was
   * decided by the data source, not by this component — and neither says the
   * binding is missing. The only loud states here are a fetch `error`
   * (`chart-error`) and a generic "No data yet"; neither is a statement about
   * an absent binding.
   *
   * ## Why it keys on the CATEGORY alone
   *
   * `resolveListChartBinding`'s `resolves` (the upstream gate, objectui#7544)
   * is `Boolean(categoryField && valueField)`, so its negation refuses when
   * EITHER is missing. That is the right question for a capability gate deciding
   * whether to OFFER a chart, and the wrong one for a renderer deciding whether
   * to DRAW one: a measure may legitimately be absent, because `count` takes no
   * field (`aggregateValueKey` projects it under the literal `'count'`), so
   * refusing on an absent measure would refuse `count` grouped by a declared
   * category — a chart that renders correctly today. The category has no such
   * out. This is `ObjectTimeline`'s clause 2 in this file's vocabulary: that
   * refusal "keys on the START axis alone", for the same reason.
   *
   * ## Three things this condition is careful about
   *
   * 1. `schema.dataset` — an ADR-0021 dataset chart selects dimensions and
   *    measures BY NAME and may legitimately declare no dimension (a single
   *    aggregate), exactly as `resolveListChartBinding`'s dataset leg says. It
   *    is a different shape with a different answer and is never refused here.
   * 2. Authored rows — `schema.data` or a `bind` scope. Those rows are handed
   *    to `ChartRenderer` as they are; no field NAME is read to fetch them, so
   *    a literal chart needs no object binding and must not be refused for
   *    lacking one. Same carve-out, same reason, as `hasAuthoredItems` in
   *    `ObjectTimeline` and as the `!boundData && !schema.data` guard on the
   *    empty state below.
   * 3. Placed above `error` and `loading`, because it is the same KIND of fact
   *    as the timeline's: a static authoring fact that no fetch outcome
   *    changes. A skeleton that resolves into a refusal, or a network error
   *    shown first, would both send the author to debug the wrong layer.
   *
   * ## What this does NOT do
   *
   * It does not retire the six `'name'` / `'value'` floors at the three relay
   * faces — that is the remainder of objectui#7547 and is mechanical only once
   * this screen exists. Until they go, the relays always hand this component a
   * category, so this branch is reached today only from a directly authored
   * `object-chart` that declares none. Pinned by
   * `ObjectChart.absentCategoryAxisRefusal-8168.test.tsx`, which measures both
   * halves: that the refusal fires, and that it does NOT fire on the schema
   * every producer composes today.

  // Query succeeded and returned nothing → a self-describing empty state, NOT

  // ## What the bare frame actually rendered — measured, not assumed
  //
  // The card was filed on the hypothesis that "a chart frame with axes is
  // arguably self-describing": an empty table is a blank rectangle, but an
  // empty chart still draws labelled axes telling the reader what WOULD have
  // been plotted. Rendered in a real browser at 220c18d05, that is false.
  // Recharts derives its ticks FROM the data, so with `data: []` there is no
  // domain and no tick to label: the bar/line families emit an SVG containing
  // two hairline axis rules and ZERO `<text>` nodes, and pie/donut emit an
  // empty `<svg>` with no marks at all. Measured against a populated control
  // in the same render, which emitted eight `<text>` nodes. So the frame is
  // not self-describing — it is a blank tile beside a `chart-error` box that
  // at least says something, which is precisely the hotcrm#1212 failure:
  // nothing on screen says whether the chart failed or is simply young.
  //
  // ## Why this is not the KPI carve-out
  //
  // `DatasetWidget` deliberately exempts metric families — "a metric (single
  // value) over an empty dataset is 0, not an empty state" — and names charts
  // on the OTHER side of that line in the same comment: "Charts and tables
  // keep the empty state (there is genuinely nothing to plot)." A KPI's `0` is
  // a datum; a chart's blank frame is an absence. So a dataset-bound chart has
  // rendered this state since #7124 and the object-bound one did not: same
  // family, same empty result, two answers. This is the surface that ruling
  // did not reach, not a new judgement.
  //
  // ## Why `DataEmptyState` and not `WidgetEmptyState`
  //
  // The seam #7124 built is `plugin-dashboard`-local and unexported (absent
  // from that package's `index.tsx`), and `plugin-charts` does not depend on
  // `plugin-dashboard`. Reaching it would mean promoting it to public API for
  // a foreign plugin — the cross-surface abstraction objectui#7132 owns.
  // `DataEmptyState` is instead the primitive that is ALREADY shared and
  // already consumed by plugin-list / plugin-kanban / plugin-detail and by
  // `WidgetEmptyState` itself, out of `@object-ui/components`, which this
  // package already depends on. Nothing is promoted, no dependency edge is
  // added, and when #7132 converges the defaults this call site collapses the
  // same way the other four do.
  //
  // The copy is the keys #7124 landed in all ten packs — no new key, and no
  // promise of recovery: it states that the load SUCCEEDED, which is the one
  // fact the reader of a blank tile cannot otherwise get. `role="status"`
  // against the `role="alert"` on the `chart-error` box above is the machine
  // check that the two states are distinct.
  //
  // Gated on a QUERY-backed chart: a chart handed inline `data: []` by its
  // author never ran a query, so "its query returned no records" would be
  // false of it, and those charts render byte-for-byte as before.
