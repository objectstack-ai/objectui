 * objectui#7210, half 2 — maintainer ruling a′ (2026-09-02), on the gantt.
 *
 * The ruling, and the pin it names: a non-grid visualisation may fetch the
 * whole FILTERED result set, because a truthful range needs all of it, but the
 * fetch carries a platform-level hard ceiling expressed as a named constant in
 * the renderer, not an authorable view key. Past the ceiling the visualisation
 * draws the first N rows and shows a LOUD FOOTNOTE naming both N and M.
 * Below it: no footnote, and the full set draws.
 *
 * ⛔ The direction the ruling calls dangerous is SILENT truncation — "a cut-off
 * schedule still looks like a schedule". That is precisely what these cases
 * exist to make impossible to reintroduce: the first one would still pass if
 * the footnote were deleted and only the cap kept, so it asserts the note's
 * text and BOTH numbers, not merely the row count.
 *
 * ⛔ This is the CAP, not the gate. objectui#7225's half gates the gantt's
 * DUPLICATE schema-driven query; nothing here is about that, and the two are
 * separate commits on this branch for that reason.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — MEASURED, and corrected from what this docblock used
 * to predict (objectui#7507). Removing `$top: NON_GRID_ROW_CEILING_TOP` from
 * `ObjectGantt`'s reload turns the truncation case red at the **`$top`
 * assertion**, 1 failed / 2 passed; the below-ceiling case stays green.
 *
 * ⚠️ It does NOT go red at the footnote. The prediction that it would — "no
 * probe row ⇒ `truncated` false ⇒ no note" — reads the mechanism backwards,
 * and a wrong mechanism in a docblock is worse than none, because the next
 * reader trusts it while deciding what an edit is safe to break. What actually
 * happens: an adapter with no `$top` answers with the WHOLE filtered set, so
 * `applyNonGridRowCeiling` sees far more rows than the ceiling, slices to it,
 * and reports `truncated` from the rows in hand. The drawn count stays 2,000
 * and the note still names both numbers. The probe row bounds the RESPONSE; it
 * is not what makes truncation detectable once an unbounded one has arrived.
 * So in this file the `$top` is graded by the `$top` assertion and by nothing
 * else — which is the reason that assertion is not redundant with the note.
