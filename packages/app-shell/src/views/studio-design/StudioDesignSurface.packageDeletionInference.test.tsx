/**
 * objectui#7821 — `onManageChanged` read a FAILED package-list refresh as
 * "the package was deleted" and evicted the author out of the Studio.
 *
 * The callback runs after every package lifecycle action fired from the
 * `PackageDetailSheet` (disable / duplicate / delete / publish / manifest
 * edit). It refreshed the list into a LOCAL `list`, initialised to `[]`, and
 * swallowed the rejection under a comment reading "keep the stale list" —
 * true of the `pkgs` state, which is simply not written, and false of the
 * local, which stayed `[]`. Three lines later `!list.some((p) => p.id ===
 * managedId)` was therefore UNCONDITIONALLY true after a failure, so the code
 * took the branch labelled `// Deleted`; when the managed package was the one
 * under the editor it navigated away, and `list[0]` being `undefined` made
 * the destination `/home`.
 *
 * Net effect: one transient `GET /api/v1/packages` failure — a 503 from the
 * durable half, a network blip, an auth expiry — threw the author out of the
 * editor, with no toast and no confirmation, while the package was still
 * there. That is the sibling defect of objectui#7368 escalated: not a
 * swallowed failure, but a swallowed failure that then decides the OPPOSITE
 * of the truth.
 *
 * These pins are behavioural, and there are three of them because the fix has
 * two ways to be wrong:
 *   1. a FAILED refresh causes NO navigation (the defect), and
 *   2. it is still REPORTED, through this file's existing objectui#7368
 *      posture (`formatMetadataError` on the shared sonner id, recorded so
 *      the trigger reads `failed`) — a fix must not buy pin 1 with silence;
 *   3. a REAL deletion — the list comes back successfully WITHOUT the package
 *      — still navigates exactly as before. ⛔ Not optional: pinning only 1
 *      and 2 lets the fix degrade into "never navigate", which strands the
 *      author on a package that no longer exists.
 *
 * ⛔ The `.catch` is deliberately still a `.catch` (one 503 must not take the
 * Studio down — objectui#7368's ruling) and there is deliberately still no
 * retry (count / backoff / what-after-giving-up are unruled policy).
