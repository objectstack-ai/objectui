 * The DIFFERENTIAL cross-file line-address citation gate (objectui#8875).

 *
 * ## The ruling this implements, and the one word that decides its shape
 *
 * The maintainer ruled on 2026-09-10, verbatim and untranslated:
 *
 *   跨文件的「某文件第几行」引用， 这种完全没必要吧，是否应该避免
 *
 * The direction taken from it (objectui#8875, comment 5617612419) has five
 * clauses. Clause 2 is this file, and its load-bearing word is DIFFERENTIAL:
 *
 *   > 相对 base 新增的跨文件 `path:line` 形引用（卡面测过的四种语法 + 无文件名
 *   > 的续写地址）即红；存量 540 条不作为门的分母，⛔ 不搭车清扫。指向重生成
 *   > 文件（`dist/*.d.ts`）的记 unresolvable，不计。
 *
 * ⛔ AN ABSOLUTE COUNT WAS EXPLICITLY REFUSED, and not on taste. It was refused
 * on a measurement: PR #8887's line shifts flipped one citation from `drifted`
 * to `resolves` BY ACCIDENT, moving the tree-wide false count 540 -> 539, and
 * the executing seat had to name that in its own pull request body as an
 * UNEARNED GREEN that belonged to nobody. A gate reading an absolute number
 * scores that as progress. So this gate never reads a total: it reads what THIS
 * BRANCH ADDED, and the existing citations are ⛔ not its denominator and ⛔ not
 * swept in by it.
 *
 * ## What is NEW, and why identity is content-shaped rather than positional
 *
 * A citation is identified, WITHIN ONE CITING FILE, by
 *
 *     syntax | the written path | the cited line number
 *
 * and compared as a MULTISET between the base blob and the head text of that
 * same file. The citing file's OWN line number is deliberately not part of the
 * identity, and neither is the prose around it:
 *
 *   - if it were, re-indenting a file, re-wrapping a paragraph or adding an
 *     import above would report every citation below as newly added. That is
 *     the positional fragility this whole card is about, rebuilt inside the
 *     instrument meant to measure it.
 *   - a citation whose CITED line number changes (`:112` edited to `:113`) IS
 *     new, and that is correct rather than a side effect: clause 4 repairs an
 *     existing address by converting it to a content anchor, never by moving
 *     the number to a different number.
 *
 * Renames are followed (`git diff -M`), so moving a file does not report its
 * citations as freshly written.
 *
 * ## The population, inherited rather than re-implemented
 *
 * The scanner, the five syntaxes, the released-CHANGELOG carve-out, the
 * same-file exclusion and the four verdicts all come from
 * `cross-file-line-citation-census.mjs` BY IMPORT. This repository treats a
 * second copy of a reader as a defect: two readers over one population is how
 * the two answers start disagreeing, and the census is already the measured
 * one. This file adds exactly one thing to it -- the base comparison.
 *
 * ⇒ everything the census excludes, this gate excludes:
 *
 *   - SAME-FILE citations. objectui#8047's carve-out reasoning ("a human reads
 *     them beside the code they annotate") still holds there, and the ruling
 *     says so in as many words: 同文件行号照 objectui#8047 的既有豁免.
 *   - RELEASED CHANGELOG SECTIONS. A changelog entry is a dated record of what
 *     was true at that release; clause 4 says they are ⛔ never re-addressed.
 *   - citations reaching a TEST NAME, which objectui#8047's ESLint rule owns at
 *     `error`. Counted and printed separately so an overlap is visible rather
 *     than silent.
 *
 * ## `unresolvable` is a THIRD answer, and it must never collapse into `false`
 *
 * The ruling: 指向重生成文件（`dist/*.d.ts`）的记 unresolvable，不计. A citation
 * into a build artifact is untracked and regenerated -- no instrument can ever
 * decide it, so calling it false would be an assertion, and calling it true
 * would be worse. The census reports that class under `no-such-file` and keeps
 * it out of its false count; this gate keeps the same three-way split and
 * asserts it in `SYNTHETIC_CASES` below, because an earlier census reported it
 * correctly and a regression here would be invisible.
 *
 * ⚠️ `unresolvable` is a VERDICT, not an exemption. A newly written citation is
 * a finding whatever it resolves to -- the convention is that the address is
 * not written, not that it is written accurately. The verdict column says what
 * a reader would find if they followed it.
 *
 * ## Enforcement: report-only first, and what flips it
 *
 * The ruling: report-only 起步，零新增后翻阻断. `ENFORCEMENT` below is the whole
 * switch, and flipping it is a one-line change plus the pin in this gate's test
 * that reads it. It ships `report-only` so that pull requests already in flight
 * are not failed by a rule whose convention text (clause 1, `AGENTS.md`) has
 * not landed yet -- that document is a governed surface and is a separate,
 * human-merged pull request.
 *
 * ⛔ Report-only does NOT mean "cannot fail". A control failure exits 1 in
 * either mode: a differential gate that reports zero because its differ is
 * broken is indistinguishable from a clean branch, which is the exact failure
 * this card exists to name one level up. Hence `SYNTHETIC_CASES`.
 *
 * ## The controls, printed on every run, fatal in both modes
 *
 * The firing control cannot be a citation that already exists in the tree: a
 * differential gate is blind to those by construction, which is the point of
 * it. It is therefore SYNTHETIC -- a base text and a head text handed to the
 * same differ the real run uses. Four cases, each pinning a different way this
 * gate could be wrong:
 *
 *   FIRES         a cross-file address added to the head text is reported.
 *   DOES NOT FIRE the same citation present in both, with the citing prose
 *                 moved down the file, is NOT reported. This is the
 *                 anti-absolute-count control and the reason the gate exists in
 *                 this shape.
 *   UNRESOLVABLE  an added citation into `packages/types/dist/*.d.ts` is
 *                 reported NEW with verdict `unresolvable`, never `false`.
 *   SAME-FILE     an added citation into the citing file itself is not in the
 *                 population at all.
