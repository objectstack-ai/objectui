/**
 * The convention for how this repository spells a GitHub Action reference, and
 * the gate that keeps the odd one out visible.
 *
 *   Run:  node scripts/check-action-ref-convention.mjs
 *         node scripts/check-action-ref-convention.mjs --list   # the census
 *   Exit: 0 = OK, 1 = an undeclared off-convention ref, a stale exception, or a
 *         collapsed census
 *
 * ## THE CONVENTION
 *
 * **Default spelling: a floating major tag, `owner/action@vN`.** Every `uses:`
 * in `.github/workflows/**` is written that way unless it is a declared
 * exception.
 *
 * **An exception is marked by an entry in `DECLARED_EXCEPTIONS` below**, keyed
 * by workflow file and action path, carrying a reason and the issue that owns
 * it. That is the ONLY form an exception takes here. Nothing else counts — in
 * particular a trailing `# v9.0.0`-style comment beside the ref is a version
 * HINT, not a reason, and this gate does not read it as one.
 *
 * ## WHY THE EXCEPTION MECHANISM IS THE POINT, NOT THE DEFAULT
 *
 * objectui#8465. On `origin/main` there were 13 distinct action references.
 * Exactly ONE was spelled differently from the other twelve — a commit SHA on
 * `actions/stale` — and it was the only reference in the repository that had
 * never resolved. 236 scheduled runs of the stale-issues workflow since
 * 2026-01-16, 0 successes, every one of them failing in `Set up job`. Eight
 * months, silent, because nothing downstream consumes that job (the broken ref
 * itself was objectui#8126).
 *
 * That workflow is GONE — objectui#8548 retired it under enforce-or-remove
 * rather than repairing it (a declared automation with zero consumers and zero
 * successes), and objectui#8126 closed with it. Its entry left this table in
 * the same commit, because rule 2 below would otherwise have turned the
 * deletion into a red `main`. ⛔ The convention did NOT leave with it: it was
 * never about that one reference, and the next off-convention ref is what it
 * exists to make loud.
 *
 * ⛔ The finding is NOT "SHA pinning is wrong". It is normally the MORE secure
 * spelling and supply-chain guidance recommends it; whether this repository
 * should move to it wholesale is a live question and a decision of its own, not
 * something this gate answers or forecloses. The finding is the SOLE INSTANCE:
 * one reference written in a form nothing else in the tree used, with no
 * convention that would have made it stand out and nothing verifying it.
 *
 * The asymmetry is the whole mechanism. A floating tag that stops resolving is
 * loud on the next run of every workflow that uses it. A lone off-convention ref
 * that never resolved is silent for as long as nobody happens to look. So the
 * durable fix is not a spelling — it is that deviating from the spelling now
 * requires an edit to THIS file, with a reason and an issue number, reviewed
 * like any other change.
 *
 * ## WHY THE DEFAULT IS THE FLOATING MAJOR TAG
 *
 * Because that is what the tree already is: 12 of the 13 refs, and the repo's
 * one deliberately reasoned per-ref pin (`changesets/action@v1`, held there by
 * `scripts/__tests__/changeset-release-action-ref-pin.test.ts` against two
 * properties of v1's source) is itself a tag. Declaring it costs nothing, moves
 * no reference, and closes no door: a later decision to pin everything to SHAs
 * changes the constant below and empties the exception table, and it would need
 * this same exception mechanism anyway.
 *
 * ⛔ Do NOT read this default as a ruling against SHA pinning, and ⛔ do not
 * "unify" the tree in either direction by editing refs under cover of this
 * gate. Changing the repository's pinning posture is a supply-chain decision
 * that belongs on its own card (objectui#8465 triage, 2026-09-08).
 *
 * ## WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It checks SPELLING, not resolvability. A SHA that points at no commit and a
 * SHA that points at a real one are indistinguishable from here — resolving
 * either needs the network. That is deliberate and it is not the hole this
 * closes: what failed in objectui#8465 was that the odd ref had no reason
 * attached and no second instance to compare against, and both of those are
 * checkable offline. A declared exception still has to be correct; the gate only
 * guarantees that someone wrote down why it exists.
 *
 * ## THE THREE WAYS THIS GATE GOES RED
 *
 *   1. An off-convention ref with no entry in `DECLARED_EXCEPTIONS`.
 *   2. An entry in `DECLARED_EXCEPTIONS` that matches nothing any more. An
 *      escape hatch nobody removes is how a baseline turns into a permanent
 *      skip-list — the same staleness check `DOCUMENTATION_EXEMPT` and
 *      `KNOWN_OFFENDERS` carry elsewhere in this repository.
 *   3. The census collapsing. A parser that stops finding refs reports a clean
 *      tree, which is the one way a scan like this lies. Floors below.

 * found missing. Every entry needs a real reason and the issue that owns it —
 * "it was like that already" is not a reason, it is the defect.
 *
 * The test below rejects an entry that no longer matches an off-convention ref,
 * so this table cannot rot into a permanent skip-list. That is not theory: the
 * one entry this table ever held named `stale.yml :: actions/stale`, and when
 * objectui#8548 deleted that workflow the entry stopped matching anything.
 * Leaving it would have made every pull request red on a `main` nobody broke,
 * so it went in the deletion's own commit — which is exactly the rule working.
 *
 * ⚠️ An empty table does NOT mean this mechanism is dormant. It means the tree
 * currently has nothing to excuse, which is the state the convention is for.
 * The gate's red branches are pinned over synthetic tables in
 * `scripts/__tests__/check-action-ref-convention.test.ts`, so emptiness here
