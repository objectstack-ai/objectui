 *
 * ## What this gate is for
 *
 * `scripts/pm/check-half-states.mjs` was copied here from objectstack
 * (objectui#5791) under a workflow header that calls it a verbatim copy and
 * enumerates the handful of things a re-sync "must not clobber". Both halves of
 * that promise decayed with nothing watching. Measured on 2026-08-28, before
 * this gate landed:
 *
 *   objectui's ported copy                        9,340 lines
 *   objectstack upstream                         12,948 lines
 *   `diff` between them                           4,637 lines
 *   the sweeper's own --self-test, here           1,116 cases
 *   the same suite, on upstream's copy            1,574 cases
 *
 * So 458 predicate cases and ~3,600 lines of fixes had landed upstream and
 * never arrived here, and the copy went on rendering a confident patrol report
 * with the corresponding rows simply missing. Nothing could see it: the port's
 * own test file pins the ADAPTATIONS (correctly -- that is its job) and by
 * construction cannot look at upstream at all.
 *
 * The direction of harm is the one this tree treats as worst. A drifted copy
 * does not fail; it reports. It became load-bearing once: objectui#6641 had to
 * hand-port H22's closure floor into this copy, because wiring the new
 * environment variable in the workflow alone would have set a variable this
 * copy did not read -- an unfloored closed reader at ~87% residue density,
 * arriving as a full-looking anchor body.
 *
 * ## The shape: reverse the declared divergences, then compare BYTES
 *
 * The pin (`scripts/upstream-port-pin.json`) carries, per ported file, the
 * upstream ref it was taken from, the SHA-256 of that upstream blob, and the
 * DECLARED DIVERGENCES as exact text pairs. Verification runs backwards:
 *
 *   ported file  --(reverse each declared divergence)-->  reconstruction
 *   SHA-256(reconstruction) === the pinned upstream digest    ? green : red
 *
 * Byte equality is the assertion, so there is no "close enough" reading and no
 * heuristic to tune. Three failure directions, all named:
 *
 *   1. an edit OUTSIDE every declared region -- the reversal succeeds and the
 *      digest differs;
 *   2. an edit INSIDE a declared region -- the reversal finds its `ported`
 *      snippet zero times and says which divergence;
 *   3. upstream moved -- same as (1) from this side, and the fix is a re-sync
 *      rather than a revert, which is why the message names the procedure.
 *
 * ## The ref lives on the ENTRY, beside the digest it describes (objectui#8288)
 *
 * The pin used to carry ONE global `upstream.ref` while every digest was
 * per-file, and `--resync` set that global field on every run. So re-syncing a
 * single file re-labelled the others with a ref their digests had never been
 * taken from: after objectui#7749 re-synced the hook self-test to `70e77ec3b`,
 * this gate printed that ref beside `check-half-states.mjs` and `invoked-as.mjs`
 * too, whose digests were taken at `bf10debd5`. Both stayed GREEN — the digest
 * is the assertion and their bytes were untouched — while the provenance line
 * beside them was false. A check that reports a wrong fact confidently is this
 * repository's worst failure direction, and it was the gate itself doing it.
 *
 * So `ref` is a required field on each `files[]` entry and the global one is
 * RETIRED, not kept as a default. A default would have to be read as
 * `entry.ref ?? pin.upstream.ref`, which is the same false label re-spelled as
 * a feature: an absent `ref` cannot be distinguished from one nobody updated.
 * Provenance is a property of a digest, so it is stored where the digest is,
 * and `validatePin` REFUSES a pin that still carries `upstream.ref` rather than
 * silently ignoring it. `upstream.repo` stays global because it is measurably
 * uniform — every entry is a port from the same repository — and splitting it
 * would be a speculative field with no reader.
 *
 * ⛔ What it deliberately does NOT do is fetch anything. A gate that reached
 * api.github.com would be red on a network hiccup and green on a cached 200,
 * and this repository's whole reason for owning a patrol is that a check which
 * cannot read its input must never read as clean (#4690). The pinned digest IS
 * the input; the `ref` beside it is provenance for a human, and the gate says
 * so rather than implying it verified it.
 *
 * ## Why a digest and not a checked-in copy of upstream
 *
 * The obvious spelling -- commit upstream's blob, apply a patch, diff -- costs
 * 784 KB of duplicated source that every future reader has to be told to
 * ignore, and it puts a second copy of the predicates in the tree, which is the
 * same disease one level up. The digest is 64 characters and answers exactly
 * the same question. The cost is that a red gate cannot show you upstream's
 * side of the diff; the message names the two commands that do.
 *
 * ## Bumping the pin IS the re-sync
 *
 *   git -C <objectstack checkout> fetch origin main
 *   git -C <objectstack checkout> show origin/main:scripts/pm/check-half-states.mjs > /tmp/up.mjs
 *   node scripts/check-upstream-port-parity.mjs --resync /tmp/up.mjs --ref <the commit sha>
 *
 * `--resync` applies the declared divergences FORWARD onto the new upstream
 * text, writes the ported file, and rewrites THAT ENTRY's ref and digest --
 * only that entry's, so a re-sync can never re-label a file it did not read. It is
 * the only supported way to move the pin, because the alternative -- editing a
 * digest by hand until the gate goes green -- is indistinguishable from
 * baselining the drift it exists to catch. Afterwards, run the ported file's
 * own suites: a divergence whose anchor upstream deleted fails LOUDLY here
 * (zero occurrences), but a divergence that still applies and no longer makes
 * sense is only visible to those tests.
 *
 * ## `--resync` REFUSES to rewrite governed surface unless told, by name
 *
 * The ledger REGISTERS a file; `--resync` REWRITES one. Those are different
 * powers and only the second one is dangerous here. `.claude/**`, `skills/**`,
 * `docs/adr/**`, `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are this repository's governed
 * surface — the operating rules every later session reads — and they carry a
 * human-merge rule precisely because no green check can say whether a rule
 * SHOULD be the rule. A tool that silently rewrites one of them in place, from
 * another repository's bytes, is a governed-surface edit nobody chose.
 *
 * So the write path asks `check-governed-queue-guard.mjs` — the repository's own
 * definition of that surface, reused rather than re-listed, so the two can never
 * disagree — and refuses, naming the path, its surface and the flag that
 * proceeds anyway. `--rewrite-governed-file` is spelled long on purpose: it
 * reads as what it does at the call site, and it is typed by whoever can PROVE
 * the re-sync content-neutral beforehand — digests computed independently
 * before the run, equal to what the pin holds after it — and by the merging
 * human otherwise.
 *
 * The worked example is PR #9300: six pinned hook entries had drifted, the
 * gate's own `--resync` was the required act, and before it ran every new
 * `upstreamSha256` was shown to equal the sha256 of `git show origin/main:PATH`
 * taken in the objectstack checkout. Every re-synced file then came back
 * byte-identical to the committed one, so the rewrite moved no governed byte —
 * which is the whole content of the permission. ⛔ The same digests computed
 * AFTERWARDS do not qualify: by then the bytes are written, and a rewrite that
 * turns out to have been content-neutral is still a rewrite nobody chose.
 * What the reservation was always aiming at is a SILENT rewrite from another
 * repository's bytes, not the identity of the person at the keyboard
 * (objectui#9303, ruled 2026-09-13).
 *
 * ⛔ The CHECK path is NOT governed by any of this. A drifted governed port reds
 * exactly like any other, with no flag and no exemption — the refusal is about
 * WRITING, and a gate that went quiet on the surface with the worst drift
 * history would be the whole card inverted.
 *
 * ## The divergences are a checklist, not a licence
 *
 * Every entry carries a `why`. An adaptation nobody can justify in one sentence
 * is drift that was written down rather than drift that was decided, and the
 * self-test refuses a pin whose entries lack one. The set is meant to SHRINK:
 * three of the entries here exist only because upstream's own self-test rows
 * are coupled to the resolved sweep repo, and would disappear the day upstream
 * derives those specimens instead of hard-coding them.
 *
 * Exit: 0 = parity holds, 1 = drift, 2 = the pin itself is unusable.
