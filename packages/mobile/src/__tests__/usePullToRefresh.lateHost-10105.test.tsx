/**
 * objectui#10105 — `usePullToRefresh` arms on the element the ref points at
 * AFTER EACH COMMIT, not only on the element present at mount.
 *
 * The hook returns an object ref, so it cannot see when a consumer attaches
 * it. Consumers attach it late in practice: a view whose first commit is a
 * loading screen mounts its host only after the data arrives, and a refresh
 * that goes back through the loading screen mounts a NEW host. The hook used
 * to bind in an effect keyed only on its handlers and `enabled`, so it
 * missed both cases, and the gesture silently did nothing.
 *
 * `Host` below is the smallest consumer with that shape. The case that mounts
 * the host on the first commit is the control. It was green before the repair
 * and has to stay green, so a repair that disarms every consumer cannot pass.
 *
 * The gesture is the hook's own native event sequence (`touchstart` →
 * `touchmove` → `touchend`) on the element, because the listeners are what
 * this file is about. happy-dom does not build a `TouchList` from an init
 * object, so `touches` is attached by hand. The start point is y=10 because
 * the move handler ignores a falsy start point.
 *
 * Every gesture, including the ones that must reach nothing, starts with
 * `await act(async () => {})`. The hook binds in a passive effect, and a
 * gesture fired before that effect runs is lost whatever the hook does. So a
 * positive case would be flaky and a negative one would pass for the wrong
 * reason. Flushing cannot rescue the defect, because the old binding effect
 * did not re-run however often effects were flushed.
