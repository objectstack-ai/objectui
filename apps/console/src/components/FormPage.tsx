/**
 * FormPage — single component that renders a FormView either as a public
 * anonymous form (`/f/:slug` → backend `GET/POST /api/v1/forms/:slug`) or
 * as an authed internal form (`/forms/:name` → `GET /api/v1/meta/view/:name`
 * + `POST /api/v1/data/:object`).
 *
 * Both modes share the same renderer; the difference is only in how the
 * spec is loaded, where submissions go, and — since objectui#4109 — what
 * happens after a successful submit when the form view declares nothing:
 * an internal submit lands on the record it just wrote, while the public
 * path keeps the anonymous `thank-you` confirmation. See
 * {@link resolveSubmitBehavior}. This is the same shape as Airtable Forms —
 * the form view metadata is identical whether it is embedded publicly or
 * used by logged-in operators.
 *
 * ## Create vs edit (objectui#4278)
 *
 * The internal route also serves EDIT, and which one it is comes from the URL:
 * `ActionRunner.executeForm` forwards the record an action was fired from as
 * `/forms/:name?recordId=<id>`. Until #4278 this route ignored that param
 * entirely — it rendered empty inputs and its submit was an unconditional
 * `POST` — so an "edit this record" action produced a blank form and then a
 * DUPLICATE record. `?recordId=` now selects the whole read/write pair:
 * `GET /data/:object/:id` to prefill, `PATCH /data/:object/:id` to save. See
 * {@link readFormRecordTarget} for the create/edit/refuse decision and
 * {@link readPrefill} for what wins when a `prefill_` param and a stored value
 * name the same field.
 *
 * ## Which object that id belongs to (objectui#4292)
 *
 * An id alone does not say which object it names, so the read/write pair above
 * resolves it against the FormView's own target — right when the action fired
 * from a record of that object, silently wrong when it did not. `?recordObject=`
 * now travels with the id and this route refuses when the two disagree; see
 * {@link FORM_RECORD_OBJECT_PARAM} for why it can only ever refuse, and the
 * guard in {@link loadInternalForm} for where it fires (before any `/data/`
 * request, so a mismatch reads nothing and writes nothing).
 *
 * ## Where a declared `redirect` goes (objectui#4190)
 *
 * `submitBehavior: { kind: 'redirect' }` was consumed as a browser-level
 * navigation on the authored string, which is why the card asked what that
 * string even meant. objectstack#7496 ruled it: a RELATIVE in-app path, with
 * `{{record.field}}` interpolation, URL-escaped when the redirect is built.
 * So the destination is a route in this shell and it is navigated to with the
 * router — a full-page navigation ignores the console mount and drops the
 * submitter at the origin root — while an out-of-contract absolute is refused
 * on screen instead of followed. See `submitRedirect.ts`.
 *
 * ## Conditional field visibility (objectui#5594)
 *
 * A FormView field may carry a CEL predicate saying WHEN it is visible —
 * `visibleWhen`, or the deprecated ADR-0089 alias `visibleOn`. This renderer
 * read neither, so such a field rendered unconditionally on both routes:
 * fail-open and silent, with no diagnostic for the author.
 *
 * It is the SECOND form renderer in this repo, which is why the gap survived.
 * objectui#2212 recorded this exact symptom and PR #2214 fixed it on the OTHER
 * chain — `ModalForm` -> `resolveFormViewLayout` -> `@object-ui/plugin-form`
 * `sectionFields.ts` -> `@object-ui/components` `renderers/form/form.tsx` —
 * which this file is on at no point, and #2212's regression pin lives with
 * that chain, so nothing in the suite could see this copy.
 *
 * The wiring is #2212's ruling applied verbatim, not a second semantics: see
 * {@link isFieldVisible} for the engine, the bound scope, and what the fix
 * deliberately does not change.
 *
 * ## The other three conditional-rule surfaces (objectui#5627)
 *
 * #5594 wired ONE of the four surfaces the sibling chain honours — the
 * view-level field predicate. The other three were dropped in the same place
 * and for the same reason: nothing downstream could read a key this file's
 * payload types did not admit.
 *
 *  - SECTION-level `visibleWhen` / `visibleOn` (ADR-0089). The section type is
 *    no longer this file's to widen — objectui#5596 replaced the hand copy with
 *    the shared `FormSectionSpec`, which has DECLARED these two keys ever since
 *    ("declaring a key is not honouring it", as that type's own docstring says
 *    while naming this card). What was missing here was the evaluation, and the
 *    render mapped every section unconditionally. See {@link isSectionVisible}.
 *  - OBJECT-level `visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` (ADR-0036),
 *    authored on the object's field rather than on the form view. This file's
 *    own `ObjectFieldDef` admitted none of them, so `readonly` and `required`
 *    were whatever the static flags said. See {@link resolveRowState}, which
 *    resolves them through the SHARED `resolveFieldRuleState` rather than
 *    re-deriving what the three rules mean for a fourth time.
 *
 * Both halves are RENDERING rules: a hidden section's fields still submit their
 * values, exactly as a hidden field's do (triage ruling, 2026-08-22, following
 * #5594 and the plugin-form chain). Nothing in this file makes visibility a
 * submit-payload rule, at either granularity.
 *
 * ## The one thing that IS a submit-payload rule (objectui#5883)
 *
 * A field whose declared `defaultValue` is an instruction the SERVER resolves
 * per insert is left out of a create payload when the control is empty — see
 * {@link omitServerOwnedBlanks}. That is not a visibility rule wearing a
 * different hat: the key is withheld precisely so the producer supplies the
 * value, which is the whole meaning of the declaration. It is the submit half
 * of the fence {@link readPrefill} put on seeding for objectui#5727, and the
 * sibling of `@object-ui/plugin-form`'s `omitServerResolvedDefaults`.

 * (`src/urlParams.ts` → `RECORD_DRAWER_PARAM`), where it opens a record-detail
 * drawer over a list. That is not a collision to route around, and #4278 ruling

 *
 *  - the two readers can never see one URL. React Router renders exactly one
 *    leaf per location, `/forms/:name` is a TOP-LEVEL route in `App.tsx`
 *    (sibling of `/apps/*`, where `ObjectView` — the drawer's only reader,
 *    `views/ObjectView.tsx`, the single `RECORD_DRAWER_PARAM` call site
 *    outside the registry itself — is mounted), and `InternalFormRoute` renders
 *    `DefaultHomeLayout` + this component and no list. Disjoint subtrees, so

 *    about". A second spelling (`formRecordId`, …) for that fact would be the
 *    de-facto second contract AGENTS.md #0.1 forbids, and would make the
 *    already-reserved name look free to repurpose.
 *
 * So this is the registry's name, used as the registry defines it. It is a
 * literal here rather than an import only because `@object-ui/app-shell`
 * exports its package root alone — its `exports` map publishes `.` and
 * `./styles.css`, nothing else — and that root does not re-export
 * `./urlParams`, so `RECORD_DRAWER_PARAM` has no spelling a consumer can
 * import. Retiring this literal means publishing the registry from that root,

 * object to resolve it against, and it picks the FormView's own target — the

 * back (`getData` returns `object: request.object`), so the response is
 * self-consistent. #4278 shipped the read/write pair that turned that from a

 * (The registry's `formObject` is deliberately the other thing: it selects the
 * object the record-form OVERLAY edits. Same `<param>Object` naming, opposite
 * powers, separate surfaces.)
 *
 * Spelled as a literal here and in `ActionRunner` for the reason
 * {@link FORM_RECORD_ID_PARAM} documents — `@object-ui/core` sits below this

 * Is this row on screen, given the form's current state?

 *
 *  1. `hidden: true` — the static flag. Unconditional.
 *  2. `visibleWhen` — the conditional predicate (ADR-0089), evaluated against
 *     the live form values on every render.
 *
 * The predicate is routed through the CANONICAL engine — `evalFieldPredicate`
 * (`@object-ui/core`, `evaluator/fieldRules.ts`) — which is objectui#2212's
 * ruling applied verbatim rather than a second predicate semantics invented
 * for this renderer. Two form renderers disagreeing about what `visibleWhen`
 * MEANS would be a worse defect than one renderer ignoring it. So the engine,
 * the accepted wire shapes (bare CEL string and `{ dialect, source }`), the
 * bound scope and the failure behaviour are the shared ones by construction,
 * not by agreement.
 *
 * Scope: `record.*` is the LIVE values — what the inputs currently hold, not
 * what was loaded — so a predicate re-decides as the user types, which is the
 * whole point of a conditional field. `previous.*` is the stored record an
 * edit form started from (objectui#4278), unbound on a create form. That is
 * the same pair `form.tsx` binds on the sibling chain.
 *
 * Fail-open (`fallback: true`) is deliberate and shared: a predicate that
 * cannot be evaluated must not HIDE a field, because a hidden field is one the
 * submitter can neither fill in nor see is missing. Open does not mean silent
 * — `evalFieldPredicate` warns once per predicate text, naming the field.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It does not strip the VALUE of a field it hides. `values` still carries
 * whatever {@link readPrefill} seeded and `handleSubmit` still submits it —
 * exactly what a statically `hidden: true` field has always done here, and
 * what the plugin-form chain does (#2212's fix returns `null` at render and
 * clears stale ERRORS, never values). Conditional visibility is a rendering
 * rule in both renderers; making it a submit-payload rule would be a new
 * contract, decided once for both, not invented here in the second one.

 * go to `@object-ui/core`'s `resolveFieldRuleState`, the engine the sibling
 * renderers (`renderers/form/form.tsx`, `WizardForm`, `GridField`,
 * `plugin-kanban`) already share. That reuse is the point of the card — a
 * FOURTH consumer-side re-implementation of "what does readonlyWhen mean" is
 * the defect, not the fix — and it is what carries three settled rulings in
 * without re-deriving any of them: a static `readonly: true` is never weakened
 * by a false predicate, a static `required: true` is never weakened by a false
 * one either, and `serverOwnedValue` outranks both spellings of required.
 *
 * ## `isCreateForm` is the CALLER's fact
 *
 * `resolveFieldRuleState` must be told whether this submit is an INSERT; it may
 * not infer it (objectui#4085 — an evaluator guessing from a missing `previous`
 * would read an edit form that simply passes none as a create). This renderer
 * knows it exactly, from the URL: {@link readFormRecordTarget} already decided
 * create / edit / refuse, and `/f/:slug` is create by construction. Passed as a
 * required parameter rather than defaulted, so a new call site cannot get edit
 * semantics by omission.
 *
 * On a create form a field whose `defaultValue` is a runtime instruction the
 * server resolves per insert (`NOW()`, `current_user`, a CEL envelope) is
 * therefore not required — whatever `requiredWhen` evaluates to (#4085) and
 * whatever the static flag says (#4069). Both halves come from the resolver,
 * not from a carve-out re-derived here; `isServerOwnedValue` is likewise the
 * shared classifier, handed the declared default this row already carries.
 *
 * ## The two visibility LAYERS are ANDed, never collapsed
 *
 * A view-level predicate ({@link isFieldVisible}) and an object-level one
 * (`rules.visibleWhen`) are different authoring slots with different owners,
 * and the sibling chain keeps them separate for exactly that reason. Either
 * one resolving false hides the control; neither can re-show what the other
 * hid. Both are evaluated on every call even when the first has already
 * decided, because the warning a broken predicate emits is the author's ONLY
 * diagnostic — short-circuiting would make a typo in one layer invisible
 * whenever the other happened to hide the row.

/**
 * The initial form state — every value an input starts life holding.
 *
 * Three sources, in strictly increasing precedence (#4278 ruling on prefill):
 *
 *  1. the field's `defaultValue` from the object schema — a CREATE-time
 *     proposal, and only when it is a LITERAL one (objectui#5727 — see below);
 *  2. the stored `record`, when this form is editing one. Present-but-null
 *     counts and beats a default: on an edit form the stored value is the
 *     truth, and letting a default paint over a cleared field would silently
 *     propose a change the user never made — which a subsequent save would
 *     then write;
 *  3. an explicit `?prefill_<field>=` query param, which wins over both.
 *
 * Point 3 is the ruling: "explicit `prefill_` params override the loaded
 * record's values for the fields they name … record values fill the rest". A
 * producer that forwards `?recordId=` AND `?prefill_x=` in one URL is
 * expressing intent — edit THIS record, with THIS field pre-changed — and the
 * narrower, per-field instruction is the more specific one. Fields the params
 * do not name keep their stored values, so the precedence is per FIELD and
 * never wholesale.
 *
 * ## A RUNTIME default is not a value, so it is not seeded (objectui#5727)
 *
 * Source 1 above admits only LITERAL defaults. A `defaultValue` may instead be
 * an *instruction* the server resolves per insert — a `DEFAULT_VALUE_TOKENS`
 * token (`'NOW()'` / `'current_user'`) or a CEL Expression envelope
 * (`{ dialect: 'cel', source: 'today()' }`). Seeding one of those literally is
 * worse than leaving the control empty: the text `NOW()` lands in a datetime
 * input and is then SUBMITTED as that field's value, and
 * `ObjectQL.applyFieldDefaults` resolves a declared default only for a field
 * that arrives absent or null — so seeding suppresses the very resolution the
 * declaration asked for. Omitting the key is what makes the server the single
 * authority for the value.
 *
 * The classifier is `@object-ui/core`'s {@link isRuntimeDefault}, imported —
 * not re-derived. It is THE published authority for this distinction and this
 * renderer already reads it once removed, via `isServerOwnedValue` in
 * {@link resolveRowState}; a second consumer-side copy would be free to
 * disagree about, say, a CEL envelope, and then this form would seed a field
 * whose `required` rule it also suppresses. `@object-ui/plugin-form`'s
 * `schemaDefaults.ts` guards its own seeding with the same call — this is that
 * settled rule reaching the SECOND form renderer in this repo, which is why
 * the gap survived (#4047 / #4068 fixed the other chain; #4069 / #4085 carried
 * the required-ness half here already).
 *
 * `isRuntimeDefault` specifically, and not `schemaDefaults.ts`'s
 * `isSeedableDefault` wrapper around it: that one additionally rejects `null`,
 * which would quietly change what a declared `defaultValue: null` does on this
 * route. The card is about runtime instructions; the null contract stays as it
 * was (`!== undefined`).
 *
 * Skipping is deliberately NOT gated on create mode, unlike the sibling
 * chain's caller-side gate. On an edit form a record that names the field
 * already outranks any default (source 2), so gating would change nothing
 * there — while a record that leaves the column UNSET is exactly where the
 * literal `NOW()` would still reach a control today. One unconditional rule
 * means "a runtime token never reaches an input on this route", with no mode
 * for it to leak through.
 *
 * The two later sources are untouched: a stored value and an explicit
 * `prefill_` param are real values a producer supplied, not declarations the
 * server is waiting to resolve, so both still fill a runtime-default field.

 * opens empty and its key never enters `values` from the declaration. That is
 * the half that handles a form nobody touched. This is the half that handles a
 * key the USER put there: a rendered control writes back through its `onChange`
 * the moment it is touched, so a submitter who types into a server-owned field
 * and then clears it puts the key back — holding a blank.
 *
 * `ObjectQL.applyFieldDefaults` resolves a declared default only for a field
 * that arrives ABSENT or NULL. A blank string is neither, so submitting one
 * stores `''` and silently defeats the declaration — the same suppression
 * #5727 closed, reached by the other door. Omitting the key is what makes the
 * server the single authority for the value.
 *
 * ## What "empty" means here, and why it is not spelled out
 *
 * The arms of {@link FieldInput} do not agree on what a cleared control writes,
 * and the filter's notion of empty is the whole fix. Measured on this
 * renderer's own controls: the text / email / url / date / time / datetime /
 * textarea / select arms write `''`; the number family writes `null` (the arm
 * spells `e.target.value === '' ? null : Number(...)`, so no `NaN` is
 * reachable); the boolean and radio arms have no "cleared" state at all —
 * `false` and a picked option are real values. A filter testing for `''` would
 * therefore have left the number arm behind.
 *
 * So emptiness is `@object-ui/core`'s {@link isMissingForRequired} — the same
 * PRESENCE predicate the `required` rule reads, which covers `undefined`,
 * `null`, a blank string and an empty array while deliberately keeping `false`
 * and `0` as values. "Left empty" cannot come to mean two different things in
 * the two halves of this fix, and it cannot come to mean something narrower
 * here than it does on the sibling chain.
 *
 * ## The sibling function, now imported rather than re-composed (objectui#6059)
 *
 * `@object-ui/plugin-form`'s `omitServerResolvedDefaults`
 * (`src/schemaDefaults.ts`) is this rule on the OTHER form chain and states the
 * pairing outright — "excusing a server-owned field from `required` is only
 * half an answer if the form then submits the key anyway". Until #6059 it had
 * no spelling a consumer could import: that package's `exports` map publishes
 * `.` alone and its root did not re-export `schemaDefaults`, so this function
 * carried the composition — `isRuntimeDefault(default) && isMissingForRequired(value)`
 * — written out by hand. The two PREDICATES were never copied (both come from
 * `@object-ui/core`, which is where they live so that every layer deciding
 * server-ownership reads one answer — `validation/server-owned-value.ts` says
 * so, and lists this renderer's `resolveFieldRuleState` among the consumers),
 * but the COMPOSITION existed twice, which #6059 recorded as the structural
 * reason the next renderer would write it a third time.
 *
 * The entry now publishes it, so this function is the CALLER: it keeps the two
 * things that are genuinely this renderer's — the create-mode gate, read off
 * the same URL switch `resolveRowState` uses, and the projection of this page's
 * own rows onto the `{ fields: { [name]: { defaultValue } } }` shape the helper
 * reads — and delegates the rule itself. `RenderableField.defaultValue` is
 * copied straight off the object field in {@link buildSections} (`def`, with no
 * FormView override for that key), so the projection carries exactly the
 * defaults the hand-written version consulted, for exactly the same names; a
 * key that no row declares gets `undefined`, which is what the old
 * `serverOwned` set said about it too. The rows rather than
 * `loaded.objectSchema` deliberately: the previous verdict was a function of
 * the RENDERED rows, and this card is explicit that nothing about the payload
 * may change.
 *
 * This file still reads `isRuntimeDefault` directly for #5727's seeding fence —
 * that half is one predicate, not a composition, and its sibling
 * (`isSeedableDefault`) deliberately differs about `null` (see
 * {@link readPrefill}).
 *
 * ## The two boundaries
 *
 * - **CREATE only.** On an edit form the token was resolved at insert, so a
 *   cleared column is a deliberate removal and dropping the key would silently
 *   discard the user's edit. `isCreateForm` is the caller's fact, read off the
 *   same URL switch `resolveRowState` uses.
 * - **Runtime defaults only.** A field with no default, or with a STATIC one
 *   (which #4068 says IS seeded into the control), keeps its blank: the user
 *   cleared something that was there, or is expressing "leave this empty", and
 *   either way that `''` is intent the form must carry.
