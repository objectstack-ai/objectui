 * object, which is what an author writes and what `JSON.parse` of stored
 * metadata produces. An exotic instance — `RegExp`, `Set`, `Map`, `URL`, a class

 * plain object's prototype has a null prototype, while a `RegExp`'s chain is one
 * link longer. So the test is about SHAPE, not about object identity.
 *
 * A plain object with no entries stays an operator map with no operators — the
 * `{}` identity — whatever else it happens to be. That boundary is deliberate:
 * this predicate separates values from operator maps, and it is not a second
 * opinion about the identity objectui#5322 already ruled on.

 * ## Not this file's ruling, and not a new one
 *
 * `FILTER_TEXT_CASES` (`@objectstack/spec/data`) carries both shapes as
 * REJECTION rows rather than as row-set expectations, each with
 * `code: 'INVALID_FILTER'` and `mustMention: ['$icontains']`:
 *

 *
 * > *a non-string `$icontains` comparand is REFUSED* — "Coercing 42 to `"42"`
 * > would answer a query nobody wrote; the declared comparand type is string."
 *
 * `ValueDataSource` has answered both since objectui#8748
 * (`refuseTextComparand`), so this is a PORT of a shipped, reviewed
 * implementation one data source over — deliberately NOT a second design.
 * Measured on `origin/main` `152f0a700` (objectui#8996 and objectui#9019 both
 * landed), both faces in one process:
 *
 * ```
 * $icontains ''   LOWER=["name","icontains",""]   MATCH=[] REFUSED(1)
 * $icontains 42   LOWER=["name","icontains",42]   MATCH=[] REFUSED(1)
 * ```
 *
 * One authored filter, refused by the in-memory matcher and lowered onto the
 * wire by the ObjectStack path — the same acceptance-set split objectui#8568 and
 * objectui#8976 each closed on the operator-KEY axis, here on the COMPARAND
 * axis. ⚠️ objectui#8996 did not open this door: before it the `$` dialect was
 * stopped by the generic unknown-operator arm, an accident rather than a
 * comparand ruling, while the object-form dialect
 * (`FILTER_OPERATOR_ALIASES` in `@object-ui/data-objectstack`) already lowered
 * the same node with no converter involved.
 *
 * ## What transfers from the sibling, and what cannot
 *
 * The DISCRIMINATION and the MESSAGE transfer verbatim, and the message is
 * load-bearing rather than cosmetic: `mustMention: ['$icontains']` means a
 * differently-worded refusal is a different failure to honour the same
 * contract, not a stylistic variant.
 * `filter-text-comparand-9001.test.ts` pins the two messages against each other
 * by DRIVING both faces and asserting this one contains the sibling's refusal
 * text, so the mirror cannot drift in silence.
 *
 * ⭐ Since objectui#9048 "transfer verbatim" is no longer a claim about two
 * copies agreeing: both halves are ONE implementation in `text-comparand.ts`,
 * and this function is the envelope that seats it. The pin above is kept, and
 * is now a pin on the SEATING rather than on a transcription.
 *
 * The DELIVERY cannot transfer, and that is the card's own Q1 answered by the
 * two call sites rather than by a fresh ruling. `ValueDataSource`
 * excludes-and-logs because it is deciding about one ROW and HAS a row to
 * exclude; this function is the PRODUCER deciding whether to send a query at
 * all, and has none. Its declared refusal shape is {@link FilterOperatorError},
 * which carries exactly the `INVALID_FILTER` / 400 envelope the spec rows
 * declare and which this file already uses for `$regex`, `$not`, the retired
 * aliases and three comparand shapes. Same code, same message, each face's own
 * envelope.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Only `$icontains`, because only `$icontains` is what the table declares. The
 * sibling positive operators (`$contains` / `$startsWith` / `$endsWith`) have no
 * such row and keep the answer they have always given here — the same boundary
 * `refuseTextComparand`'s own docblock draws one data source over. Widening it
 * by analogy is the published table's decision, not this file's, and the
 * asymmetry is pinned so the next reader sees a scope boundary rather than an
 * oversight.

    //     answer was EVERY ROW;

    //     route beside it) JSON-serialises the same object into `filter=`, and
    //     `{ a: null }` is a well-formed `FilterCondition` the spec accepts
    //     (`null` is in `ACCEPTED_FILTER_COMPARAND_TYPES`), so it arrived as a
    //     REAL predicate and the answer was SOME rows.
    //
    // One authored filter, two row sets, and the deciding input was whether the
    // query happened to want a lookup expanded — the split objectui#6948
    // recorded on this file and the shared `translateFilterToAST` helper exists
    // to close. It was also self-inconsistent within ONE route: the key meant
    // "no constraint" the moment ANY sibling produced a condition and meant a
    // predicate when it was alone, which is the sibling-dependence objectui#8555
    // named here.
    //
    // ⇒ the tie is broken by what this function ALREADY says about the key, not
    // by inventing a meaning for it. The loop's `continue` is the ruling: the key
    // contributes no condition. Carrying that to the wire is `undefined`, and an
    // author who wants the predicate has always been able to spell it
    // `{ a: { $null: true } }` → `['a', 'is_null', true]`. The opposite repair —
    // making a null-valued key lower to a predicate — would have broken the skip
    // pin and changed every caller.

    // ⚠️ SAME ANSWER as the fold above, NOT the same state, which is why these
    // are two counts and two guards rather than one. That fold's `undefined` is
    // objectstack#5322's RULED identity, reached by `lowerLogicalGroup`; this

    // coincide because "no constraint" has exactly ONE expressible spelling in
    // this dialect — the absence of the slot — not because the two inputs are
    // the same kind of thing.
    //
    // A filter that MIXES the two kinds (`{ $and: [], a: null }`,

    // about the two STATES and never about the two ARMS being unreachable from
    // one input.
    //
    // ⛔ `{}` is not this case either — `skippedNullKeys > 0` excludes it. An

  // spec's doors pass that node through unjudged — `isFilterAST` is `true` and
  // `parseFilterAST` hands back `{ tags: ['a'] }` — which is the SAME
  // array-in-a-scalar-slot shape the object arm above refuses (objectui#8530):
  // the ObjectQL AST has no array-equality node, `@objectstack/driver-sql`
  // answers `400 INVALID_FILTER`, and every in-memory matcher excludes every
  // row. So a hand-authored `{ tags: ['a'] }` already failed fast with a message
  // naming `$in`, while the same mistake SAVED INTO A VIEW still travelled
  // silently to a 400 the author could not attribute to their filter. This
  // closes that asymmetry.
  //
  // Keyed on the operator's ARITY, never on `Array.isArray(value)` alone:
  // `in` / `not_in` / `between` rules legitimately carry arrays through this
  // very function, and that path had no pin protecting it until this card.
  // The check runs AFTER normalization so an alias is judged by what it means —
  // `nin` is `not_in`, and is array-valued.
  //
  // An operator the spec does NOT know is left alone. `normalizeFilterOperator`
  // passes a misspelling through verbatim precisely so `isFilterAST` refuses it
  // and the server names it; refusing it HERE would report the wrong problem
  // ("use $in") for what is actually a typo.
  //
  // ## Why the refusal is a THROW, and why it belongs here
  //
  // It throws from the lowering, which for a saved view means the view fails at
  // render rather than returning a narrower answer. That is a real blast radius
  // and it was weighed:
  //
  //   - It is not a NEW blast radius. Both sinks already catch a
  //     `FilterOperatorError` from this same file — `plugin-list`'s
  //     `buildEffectiveFilter` runs inside `ListView`'s load `try` and lands in
  //     `setLoadError`, `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView` calls `mergeFilterNodes`
  //     inside its own load `try` — because the object arm has thrown for
  //     `$regex`, `$not` and bare arrays since objectui#8530. `classifyLoadError`
  //     reads this error's `INVALID_FILTER` / `400`, so what a user sees is the
  //     "filter is malformed" panel, not a crashed page and not a network error.
  //   - The alternatives are both silent. DROPPING the rule widens the result
  //     set, the one direction this file exists to avoid — and a stored view's
  //     whole purpose can be to hide rows. Rewriting `equals` into `in` changes
  //     the author's meaning, the lenient second contract objectui#8514 was
  //     resolved against on this same data shape.
  //   - The rule was authored long ago by someone who is not present, which
  //     argues for the LOUDER answer, not the quieter one: a silent 400 two
  //     layers away is attributable to nothing, whereas this names the view's
  //     field and operator at the moment the filter is built.

  // `ValueDataSource`, because all three now read ONE implementation
  // (`text-comparand.ts`) rather than three copies of it. Triage ruled exactly
  // that: "three implementations of one refusal, of which one is correct ⇒ the
  // useful dispatch is not 'add a third guard' but 'make the dialects share the
  // one that works'".
  //
  // ## Placed AFTER the arity arm, deliberately
  //
  // An ARRAY comparand on `icontains` is refused by objectui#8557 above, with
  // its message about `in` / `not_in` / `between`. Running this door first would
  // answer the same input with "not a string" — a true sentence that prescribes
  // the wrong repair, and a silent change to a shipped ruling this card is
  // fenced away from.
  //
  // ## An ABSENT comparand is left alone, and that is a boundary not an omission
  //
  // `isRefusedTextComparand(undefined)` is true, so the `!== undefined` test is
  // load-bearing. The `$` dialect has no "absent" — `{ $icontains: undefined }`
  // still HAS the key — but this vocabulary does, and the tail below already
  // encodes it: a rule with no `value` lowers to the 2-tuple `[field, operator]`
  // because the valueless operators (`is_null` and friends) take their direction
  // from the operator NAME. Measured on today's tree, that 2-tuple is already
  // refused downstream with THIS card's code: `parseFilterAST(['name',
  // 'icontains'])` throws `INVALID_FILTER` / 400 naming
  // `where.name.$icontains`. So the shape is loud already; moving WHERE it is
  // refused is a separate argument nobody has made, and `FILTER_TEXT_CASES`
  // declares two rows, not three.
  //
  // ## Why a THROW here, when it means a saved view fails at RENDER
  //
  // This is objectui#8557's weighing done again on a different input, not
  // inherited from it — the card says so, and the inputs really do differ.
  // Measured on `origin/main` `6df26f025` with `@objectstack/spec` 17.4.0, one
  // authored view rule `{ field: 'name', operator: 'icontains', value: '' }`:
  //
  //   - it lowers to `['name','icontains','']`, which `isFilterAST` ACCEPTS, so
  //     it is sent rather than stopped at any door;
  //   - `parseFilterAST` reads it as `{ name: { $icontains: '' } }`;
  //   - against the in-memory matchers that condition selects ZERO of the
  //     spec's own nine `FILTER_TEXT_ROWS` (`@objectstack/formula`'s
  //     `matchesFilterCondition`, and `ValueDataSource` since objectui#8748,
  //     which also prints a refusal);
  //   - and on the wire the published table states the other answer in its own
  //     words — "Every row contains the empty substring, so evaluating it is a
  //     predicate that constrains nothing".
  //
  // So the pre-fix answer is not one behaviour but TWO, chosen by which data
  // source the saved view happens to render against: silently-empty on the
  // in-memory faces, constrains-nothing on the wire. That is the acceptance-set
  // split this card family exists to close, and neither half is "a view that
  // renders correctly today". objectui#8557's conclusion (loud beats
  // silently-empty) covers the first half unchanged; the second half is the
  // WIDENING direction this file's own arity arm names as the one it exists to
  // avoid — "a stored view's whole purpose can be to hide rows". Both halves
  // point the same way, which is why the weighing survives the different input.
  //
  // The blast radius is also smaller than the shape suggests, measured rather
  // than assumed. The Console cannot author this rule: `foldFilterGroupToSpecRules`
  // (`@object-ui/app-shell`, objectui#4155) DROPS a condition whose value is
  // `null` / `''` / `[]` before it is persisted, precisely so an incomplete row
  // never reaches storage. And nothing in this tree authors the shape: over
  // every tracked file, an `operator: 'icontains'` rule appears only in this
  // card's own test, changeset and comment — lit control, 40 tracked files
  // mention the operator at all.
  //
  // ## ⚠️ Where the throw LANDS is a second question, and it is NOT settled here
  //
  // Two of the sinks catch it: `plugin-list`'s `buildEffectiveFilter` runs
  // inside `ListView`'s load `try` and `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView` inside its
  // own, and `classifyLoadError` reads this error's `INVALID_FILTER` / `400`, so
  // there the user sees the "filter is malformed" panel naming their field and
  // operator. FOUR more entries do not: `plugin-grid`'s `ObjectGrid` (twice),
  // `plugin-detail`'s `RelatedList` and `plugin-form`'s `LineItemsPanel` all
  // call `toFilterNode` inside a RENDER-time `useMemo`, where a throw
  // propagates as a render error with no `classifyLoadError` in the path.
  // `ObjectGrid` feeds it `schema.filter`, which the spec declares as
  // `z.array(ViewFilterRuleSchema)` — i.e. exactly the shape this arm judges.
  //
  // That is objectui#9050, an OPEN card on the DELIVERY axis, and this arm
  // deliberately does not pre-empt it. It is not a class this card creates or
  // even joins first: objectui#8557's array-arity refusal directly above throws
  // from this same function through those same four entries and has shipped
  // that way, and objectui#9050 counts eleven pre-existing throw sites reachable
  // the same way. ⛔ The alternatives are worse in the direction this whole card
  // family exists to close — dropping the rule widens the result set, lowering
  // it keeps the two-answers split. So the refusal lands and WHERE it surfaces
  // stays objectui#9050's decision to make for all thirteen at once.

/**
 * Normalize ONE filter source into a single filter node.
 *
 * A "source" is whatever a view hands a renderer, and there are three shapes in
 * circulation, all legitimate:
 *
 *   - `[{ field, operator, value }, ...]`  a spec `ViewFilterRule[]`
 *   - `[['stage', '=', 'won'], ...]`       an AST node / legacy flat array
 *   - `{ status: 'active' }`               a MongoDB-style object
 *
 * The third is the one that kept getting lost. Renderers tested `source.length
 * > 0` before using it, which is `undefined > 0` for an object — so a
 * `table.defaultFilters` (declared `Record<string, any>`) was DROPPED and the
 * view returned every record. Silently: no error, just a wider answer.
 *
 * The FIRST never worked at all (objectui#3431). The array branch returned
 * every array VERBATIM, so a saved view's `ViewFilterRule[]` travelled to
 * `$filter` as bare rule objects — which the server refuses: `isFilterAST` is
 * false for an array of objects, and the wire face answers `400
 * INVALID_FILTER`. Verified against a real backend on the showcase's SHIPPED
 * `showcase_task.in_progress` view (`filter: [{field:'status',
 * operator:'equals', value:'in_progress'}]`): 400 as sent, 200 with its 2 rows
 * once lowered to `[['status','equals','in_progress']]`. Every saved view
 * carrying a filter was a failed list. `mergeFilterNodes` below has warned
 * about exactly this hazard since it was written — the warning was accurate,
 * and the sink it warns for never implemented the lowering it describes.
 *
 * **Why the fold lives HERE and not at the producer.** `ListViewSchema.filter`
 * / `ViewTab.filter` are spec-declared `z.array(ViewFilterRuleSchema)`, and a
 * view hands a renderer a `ListViewSchema` — so folding one hop earlier (in
 * `app-shell`'s ObjectView, say) would write ObjectQL AST triples INTO a
 * spec-declared rule-array slot: an off-spec value in a spec field, AGENTS.md
 * #0.1 inverted. This function is the last hop before the wire, where the value
 * legitimately leaves the spec's view vocabulary and becomes an ObjectQL AST.
 * It is also the single sink both producers already share — `plugin-list`'s
 * `buildEffectiveFilter` (which feeds the grid AND the export) and
 * `plugin-view`'s ObjectView (calendar / kanban / gallery / timeline). One
 * lowering, one place; the same reason the MongoDB-style shape is lowered here
 * rather than at each of its callers.
 *
 * Mixed arrays fold ELEMENT-WISE, because that is what reaches this function in
 * practice: `ObjectView` concatenates a saved view's rules with the
 * `?filter[<field>]=<value>` URL triples into one array. Triples pass through
 * untouched.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` for an absent or empty source, so callers can skip
 * `$filter` rather than sending an empty array — and, since objectui#8770, for
 * an object source that is nothing but TRUE-identity combinators
 * (`{ $and: [] }`), and since objectui#9020 for one whose every key is skipped
 * for a null/undefined value (`{ a: null }`). Both constrain nothing and so
 * contribute nothing to the `and` {@link mergeFilterNodes} builds. Those answers
 * are inherited from {@link convertFiltersToAST}, not decided a second time
 * here — including the fact that they are two separate decisions there.
