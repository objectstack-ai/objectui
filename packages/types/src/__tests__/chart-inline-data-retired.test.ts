/**
 * `ChartDataSeries.data` is an ADR-0049 RETIREMENT TOMBSTONE, and `categories`
 * is NOT retired — it is live with corrected prose (objectui#6896, maintainer
 * ruling 2026-08-31, decision batch #20 ③).
 *
 * ## What was measured
 *
 * The static `ChartSchema` node declared two data keys that its renderer does
 * not implement the way the declaration said:
 *
 *   1. `data: number[]` was REQUIRED on every authored series and read by
 *      nothing. `normalizeChartSchema`'s `normalizeSeries`
 *      (`@object-ui/plugin-charts`) reads `dataKey`/`name`, `label`,
 *      `chartType`/`type`, `variant`, `opacity`, `dashArray`, `stack`, `yAxis`
 *      and `color` — `data` is not among them. Rows come from the chart-level
 *      `data`, a key `ChartSchema` never declared at all, which survives only
 *      because `BaseSchema` carries an index signature.
 *   2. `categories` was documented as "X-axis labels/categories" and is read as
 *      an ALTERNATIVE SERIES LIST — consulted only when `series` is absent, each
 *      entry normalized as `{ dataKey }`. The category axis comes from
 *      `xAxisKey` / `xAxis`.
 *
 * The ruling split them: (1) is retired, immediately and without a dual-reading
 * window; (2) keeps its behaviour and its prose was corrected to match — prose
 * follows machine. Fixing only (1) was named as NOT a valid landing, so both
 * halves are pinned here.
 *
 * ## Why a tombstone and not a deletion
 *
 * `ChartDataSeriesSchema` is a NON-STRICT `z.object`, so a deleted key is
 * silently STRIPPED — one silent no-op traded for another. The tombstone keeps
 * the key DECLARED and unwritable: `?: never` on the interface (a `tsc` error at
 * the authoring site) and `retirementTombstone()` on the mirror (a parse refusal
 * whose message IS the migration note). The COUNTER-PROBE below builds the
 * deletion that was not chosen, in this same run, and measures the difference —
 * so "simplifying" the tombstone into a deletion turns this file red instead of
 * quietly restoring the silence.
 *
 * The `@ts-expect-error` directives are REAL enforcement: this package
 * type-checks its tests through `tsconfig.test.json`, so re-widening the
 * declaration fails the build on the unused directive.
