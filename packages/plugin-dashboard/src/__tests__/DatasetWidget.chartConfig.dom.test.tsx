/**
 * objectstack#7016 — END TO END: dashboard metadata → real chart DOM.
 *
 * The sibling `DatasetWidget.chartConfig.test.tsx` pins the decision at the
 * schema seam. That is necessary and not sufficient: the criterion for lowering
 * a `chartConfig` key is that the chart block *draws* it, and a seam assertion
 * cannot tell a honoured prop from an ignored one. So this file renders the REAL
 * chain — `DatasetWidget` → `SchemaRenderer` → the registry's `chart`
 * (`ChartRenderer`) → `AdvancedChartImpl` — with no renderer stub at all, and
 * reads the resulting DOM.
 *
 * Scope of THIS file: everything the chart draws OUTSIDE Recharts'
 * `ResponsiveContainer` — the ChartFrame titles, and the chart container's
 * height and accessible name. Recharts' own marks (bars, LabelList, reference
 * lines, Brush) need a measured box, which this harness does not give them
 * (`ResponsiveContainer` measures 0×0 and renders no children), so asserting
 * their absence *here* would pass for the wrong reason.
 *
 * ⚠️ This header used to end by saying those marks could be pinned in
 * `packages/plugin-charts/src/ChartRenderer.dashboardChartConfig.test.tsx`
 * alone, "the only place in this repo that can, since `recharts` resolves
 * inside plugin-charts alone". objectui#9203 corrected that, and both halves
 * of the correction matter:
 *
 *  - The premise survives — `recharts` does resolve inside `plugin-charts`
 *    alone, so `vi.mock('recharts')` is genuinely unavailable here.
 *  - ⭐ The conclusion was false, and worse than false: that file hand-builds
 *    its own chart schema, so it never travels the dashboard seam at all. When
 *    PR objectui#9202 ablated the inline relays' forwarding, **46 assertions
 *    went red across the three dashboard files and 0 in that one**. It was
 *    never coverage for the plot-internal keys on any dashboard face — an
 *    assertion that stays green while the thing it names is deleted is not
 *    evidence (objectui#7963's `confirmVariant`, same shape).
 *
 * No module mock is needed to close that: `ResponsiveContainer` seeds its size
 * from `getBoundingClientRect` on its OWN element, so a stub scoped to the
 * `recharts-responsive-container` element is enough. The dataset face's
 * plot-internal keys (`colors`, `categoryColors`, `showDataLabels`,
 * `annotations`, `interaction`) are pinned that way, on this seam, in
 * `DatasetWidget.chartConfigMarks-9203.test.tsx` — the sibling to this file.
 * ⛔ Do not cite `plugin-charts`' file as their coverage again.
 *
 * The assertions below are deliberately left exactly as they were: they are the
 * LIT CONTROL for that ablation (the four keys that do redden here), and this
 * file's own harness stays box-free so the negative `aria` pin at the bottom
 * keeps meaning what it says.

// Registers `chart` in the ComponentRegistry, which is what `SchemaRenderer`
// resolves the widget's `{ type: 'chart' }` schema through. This is the
// package's whole published surface, and it is all this file needs: production
// reaches `AdvancedChartImpl` ONLY through the `React.lazy(() =>
// import('./AdvancedChartImpl'))` factory inside `ChartRenderer`, so this test
// reaches it the same way — by rendering the real chain and awaiting the
// Suspense boundary (objectui#4529). It used to also side-effect import
// `@object-ui/plugin-charts/AdvancedChartImpl` to pre-warm that chunk, but the
// package publishes `"."` alone, so that specifier resolved only through this
// repo's vitest alias — the objectui#4325 packaging gap, whose ruling (PR
// #4460) is that the unpublished deep subpath goes rather than the surface
// growing to keep it alive. See `renderWidget` for how the wait it used to
// shorten is now budgeted instead.
