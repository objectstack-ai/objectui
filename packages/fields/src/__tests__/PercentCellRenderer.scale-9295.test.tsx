/**
 * objectui#9295 — `PercentCellRenderer` read `precision` as a FRACTION-digit
 * count, in the same file whose number arm records that `precision` is the
 * TOTAL digit count of a `decimal(p, s)` column.
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` declares the pair on the field face in its own words —
 * `precision` is "Total digits (non-negative integer)" and `scale` is "Decimal
 * places (non-negative integer)" — so the member to read is `scale`. This is
 * the identical repair objectui#2131 made on the currency arm and
 * objectui#2134 on the number arm, arriving one type later.
 *
 * ── Why the assertions are on RENDERED OUTPUT ───────────────────────────
 * The defect is what the user sees in the cell, and `formatPercent` is a
 * shared helper that was never wrong — it formats to the width it is handed.
 * Asserting the helper's return value would pin the wrong end and stay green
 * on the defect. Every row below goes through the component.
 *
 * ── What fails before the repair ────────────────────────────────────────
 * `decimal(10, 2)` — `{ precision: 10, scale: 2 }` — rendered
 * `25.0000000000%` for a stored `0.25`, padded out to the column's TOTAL
 * width. The grid footer beneath it read `Sum: 25.0000000000%` for the same
 * reason; its half of this card is pinned in `@object-ui/plugin-grid`.
 *
 * ── The ABSENT-`scale` case is a DECISION, not a leftover ───────────────
 * An absent `scale` stays `0` here, and deliberately NOT the `undefined`
 * (min 0 / max 20) that `NumberCellRenderer` uses for the same absence. This
 * path multiplies by 100 first (`percentDisplayValue`) and `Intl` renders from
 * the shortest decimal representation of the resulting double, so an unbounded
 * maximum prints binary residue: measured, a stored `0.07` scales to
 * `7.000000000000001` and `0.29` to `28.999999999999996`. The last two cases
 * below pin that those values stay readable.
