/**
 * Marks a swimlane row as a participant in the board's ONE horizontal axis
 * (objectui#8448).
 *
 * The swimlane layout paints its column titles once, above every lane, and then
 * paints each lane's cells in its own row. Both rows are `overflow-x-auto`, so
 * before this attribute existed they were INDEPENDENT scroll containers: driving
 * a lane to `scrollLeft: 298` left the header at `0`, and every column title
 * then sat over the wrong column. Measured in Chromium 1194 at 1600x1000 with
 * five columns — `'Open'` title at x=200, the Open lane cell at x=-97 — and the
 * row already overflows at ordinary widths there (`scrollWidth` 1840 vs
 * `clientWidth` 1552). Nothing errored; the board simply lied about which lane
 * was which status, which is worse than the height-0 row objectui#7303 fixed
 * because that one failed loudly.
 *
 * ⚠️ The sync is a scroll handler rather than one shared scrolling ANCESTOR,
 * and that is a measurement, not a preference. Folding the header row and the
 * lane rows into a single `overflow-x-auto` wrapper is refused by objectui#7303's
 * own pin, which reads the header row as `region.firstElementChild` and asserts
 * that its `pl-*` indent EQUALS the lane content row's. A wrapper becomes that
 * first child, and hoisting the shared indent onto it is exactly what makes the
 * two indents differ — so the restructuring cannot be done without editing a pin
 * that must stay unweakened. It also drags the lane chrome (border box and
 * collapse button) inside the scroller, where the lane's own name scrolls out of
 * view: a second "the board no longer says which lane this is" defect, of the
 * family this fix exists to remove.
 *
 * Keeping the DOM as it is has a second payoff: the header row stays a direct
 * flex child of the swimlane region, so objectui#8449's ruled vertical arm
 * (region scrolls, header row sticks) remains reachable without undoing any of
 * this. That arm has since landed — the region is `overflow-y-auto` and this
 * row is `sticky top-0` — and it needed no change here, as predicted.

/**
 * The horizontal padding carried by EVERY row on the swimlane board's shared
 * horizontal axis — the column-header row and each lane content row alike.
 *
 * It is one constant, used twice, because equal `scrollLeft` is only equal
 * ALIGNMENT while the two kinds of row have the same scrollable RANGE, and the
 * range is `scrollWidth - clientWidth` — which horizontal padding moves
 * (objectui#8797). The rows carried different padding before this: the lane
 * rows had `px-2`, the header row had none, so the lane rows' `scrollWidth` was
 * 8px larger. objectui#8448's sync copies one `scrollLeft` onto every row, so
 * driving a lane to its own maximum asked the header row for a position past
 * ITS maximum, the header row CLAMPED, and every column title stopped tracking
 * its column — permanently, until the user scrolled back.
 *
 * ⚠️ `pl-36 sm:pl-44` must stay AFTER `px-2`, and both must stay in this one
 * string. Tailwind emits `pl-*` after `px-*`, so the indent wins the left side
 * and `px-2`'s only live effect is the 8px on the RIGHT — measured, both rows
 * read `padding-left: 176px` at `sm`. Splitting them across two class lists is
 * what let them drift apart in the first place.
 *
 * Measured in Chromium 1194 at 1600x1000, five columns and six swimlanes, the
 * axis driven through the real input pipeline with `mouse.wheel`:
 *
 *   before  header max scrollLeft 288, lane max 298 -> worst title/cell dx 9px
 *   after   header max scrollLeft 296, lane max 298 -> worst title/cell dx 1px
 *
 * ⚠️ The residual 2px of range is NOT padding and cannot be closed from here:
 * each lane row sits inside the lane's `border rounded-lg` wrapper, so its
 * `clientWidth` is 1550 against the header row's 1552. That same 1px border is
 * the 1px title/cell baseline objectui#7303 and objectui#8448 already record.
 * Reported on objectui#8797 rather than compensated for with a magic offset.

 *
 * This is a shared function rather than a ternary copied per call site because
 * the swimlane layout has no column components to inherit the behaviour from.
 * The rule previously existed only on the flat path, so a swimlane board stayed
 * viewport-sized — `w-[85vw]` on every cell — while the docblock over

/**
 * How a lane count is WRITTEN, in ONE place, for every header on this board.
 *
 * The number handed in is `col.cards.length` — the count of fetched rows that
 * fell into this lane. The fetch is windowed at a real `$top` (objectui#4025),
 * and the board groups what came back, so over any object with more rows than
 * the window that number is not the size of the group: every lane is short,
 * the lanes sum to the window, and the result is CREDIBLE — 77 / 19 / 2 reads
 * as a plausible funnel against a true 88 / 46 / 28 / 14 / 9 / 15, so nothing
 * prompts the reader to distrust it (objectui#8307).
 *
 * The fix is not a better number — this component does not have one, and
 * getting one means a server-side group-count aggregate over the whole
 * filtered set. The fix is to stop the number claiming to be something it is
 * not: `77+` says "at least 77", which is what a count over a window actually
 * establishes.
 *
 * ⚠️ The boundary case is deliberate. `countsAreWindowed` comes from
 * "the fetch came back with at least as many rows as it asked for", and a
 * board holding EXACTLY the window is indistinguishable from a truncated one
 * from this side of the wire — no client-side signal separates them without
 * asking the server a second question. So such a board renders `77+` for a
 * lane that really does hold 77. That is the safe half of the ambiguity:
 * "at least 77" is TRUE when the lane holds exactly 77, whereas the bare
 * "77" is FALSE whenever the board is in fact truncated. The marker is
 * conservative; it is never wrong.
 *
 * A shared function rather than a template literal repeated per header,
 * because this board paints lane counts from three places (the flat column
 * header, and the swimlane layout's column-title row and lane rows) and a
 * count that is honest on one layout and bare on another is the same defect
 * with a smaller blast radius. Adding a header means calling this.

           It was `overflow-hidden`, which made the lanes below the fold
           UNREACHABLE rather than merely awkward: the region is a flex item of
           a height-bounded (`h-full`) board, and a non-`visible` overflow
           zeroes a flex item's automatic minimum size, so the region was
           already being shrunk to the board's height while its content stayed
           at full height — measured in Chromium at 1600x1000 with three lanes
           as `scrollHeight` 2104 against `clientHeight` 1000, with
           `document.documentElement` not scrollable either. Two of the three
           lanes had no gesture that reached them.

           `overflow-y-auto` puts the scroll where the overflow is and leaves
           the board a self-contained pane — the ruling's option A. Option B
           (drop the height bound, let the page scroll) was refused on blast
           radius: it changes what the component promises every embedder, and
           none were enumerated.

           ⚠️ The Y axis only. `overflow-x` stays `hidden` here so this does not
           become a second horizontal scroller competing with the ONE axis
           objectui#8448 settled on the header row and the lane rows. Pinned by
           `__tests__/swimlaneVerticalScroll-8449.test.tsx`. */
        <div className={cn("flex flex-col gap-2 px-4 sm:px-6 pb-3 sm:pb-4 min-w-0 overflow-x-hidden overflow-y-auto", className)} role="region" aria-label="Kanban board with swimlanes">
          {/* Column headers.
              This is a SECOND header implementation, parallel to the per-column
              `<h3 id={`kanban-col-${column.id}`}>` that `KanbanColumnView`
              renders. The two cannot be folded into one: this layout has no
              column components at all — every lane paints its own row of plain
              column cells — so the titles have to be drawn once, above every
              lane, instead of once per column.

              Having no column components is also why the width has to be
              applied by hand here: these cells and the lane cells below take it
              from `columnWidthClasses(columnInlineStyle)`, the same source
              `KanbanColumnView` reads on the flat path (objectui#8508). The two
              rows must stay on the same width for the titles to sit over their
              columns, exactly as with the `pl-*` indent noted below.

              `shrink-0` is load-bearing, not cosmetic (objectui#7303). This row
              is a flex ITEM of the swimlane region, which is a `flex-col` inside
              a height-bounded board (`h-full`). `overflow-x-auto` makes the row
              a scroll container, and a flex item's automatic minimum size
              (`min-height: auto`) applies only while its overflow is `visible`
              — so as a scroll container this row may legally be shrunk to
              height 0. The lanes below stay `overflow: visible`, so their own
              automatic minimum size clamps them at content height and they
              refuse to shrink: the moment the lanes overflow the board, the
              ENTIRE deficit lands on this one shrinkable item. The titles then
              stay in the DOM, at the right coordinates, painting nothing.
              Measured in Chromium 1194 at 1600x1000 before the fix: row height
              0, cell height 0, title span height 16, and `elementFromPoint` at
              a title's own centre returning the lane-collapse `<button>` behind
              it. Pinned by `__tests__/swimlaneColumnHeaderRow-7303.test.tsx`.

              The horizontal padding is shared with the lane content rows
              below, as the single `SWIMLANE_AXIS_X_PADDING` constant both class
              lists interpolate — the `pl-36 sm:pl-44` half is what lines the
              titles up with their columns, and the `px-2` half is what keeps
              the two rows' scroll RANGES equal (objectui#8797). It must move on
              both rows or neither, which is now a property of the source rather
              than of two class lists agreeing by hand.

              `pt-3 sm:pt-4` is the region's former TOP padding, moved onto this
              row on purpose. A scroll container's padding is inside its
              scrollport, so content scrolls THROUGH it: with the padding left
              on the region, a 16px band of the previous lane's cards stayed
              visible above the pinned header (measured in Chromium — the header
              stuck at `top + 16`, not `top + 0`). Carried here it is painted
              with the row's own opaque background instead. The region keeps
              `pb-*`, which nothing scrolls past.

              `sticky top-0` is the other half of objectui#8449's ruling. Now
              that the region scrolls vertically, a header row that scrolled
              away with the lanes would recreate objectui#7303's defect by a
              different route — the titles gone, the cells still there. The row
              is a direct flex child of the scrolling region, so it sticks to
              that region's scrollport. `bg-background` is load-bearing with it:
              without an opaque background the lanes paint THROUGH the pinned
              row. `z-10` orders it above the lane cards, whose drag transforms
              (dnd-kit) otherwise paint over it as later positioned siblings.

              ⚠️ `sticky` does NOT take the row out of the flex shrink pool —
              a sticky box is still in flow — so `shrink-0` above stays exactly
              as load-bearing as objectui#7303's pin says it is. */}
