/**
 * objectui#6285 — `CURATED_CAPABILITY_LABELS` equals `@objectstack/spec/security`'s
 * `PLATFORM_CAPABILITIES`, and every member of it reaches the screen as a
 * localized label.
 *
 * ## What went wrong, and why nothing caught it
 *
 * The declaration was a seven-member list under a doc comment claiming it
 * mirrored `PLATFORM_CAPABILITIES`. The spec grew an eighth member
 * (`manage_sharing`) and the list did not follow, so that capability fell
 * through to `byName.get(name)?.label` — the English label the `sys_capability`
 * registry serves — and rendered untranslated in all ten packs, beside seven
 * siblings that localize. Every gate stayed green, and the reason is exact:
 * `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` reads this declaration as the
 * `capability.label.` family's vocabulary and checks that each member it names
 * has an `en` key. All seven did. No instrument compared the vocabulary to the
 * array it was named after, so the member the list never mentioned was invisible
 * to the entire toolchain.
 *
 * This file is that missing comparison. It is the reason the list is allowed to
 * stay a repo-local literal (see the declaration's own comment for why a runtime
 * derivation was measured and declined), and it is deliberately the same shape
 * as `packages/app-shell/src/hooks/__tests__/tenancyPostureWall.parity.test.ts`:
 * a local restatement, held to the protocol by a test that imports the protocol.
 * Tests are not bundled, so the assertion is free.
 *
 * ## Two layers, and both are needed
 *
 *   - SOURCE parity — the member set equals the spec's names, in both
 *     directions. Read with the i18n gate's OWN `readVocabulary`, so what this
 *     file pins is precisely what that gate consumes; a rewrite that made the
 *     declaration unreadable to the gate would fail here first, instead of
 *     silently downgrading the gate to a prefix check.
 *   - RENDERED parity — each member resolves to a real localized string on
 *     screen. Source parity alone would pass with the label table empty, and the
 *     `en` table alone says nothing about `useFieldTranslation`'s provider-less
 *     defaults map, which is what actually renders when no I18nProvider is
 *     mounted.
 *
 * Every registry row fed in below carries a label deliberately UNLIKE the
 * localized one (`REGISTRY …`). "The picker renders" passes in both worlds; each
 * assertion here is written to fail in exactly one. If the list regressed — or
 * if `labelFor`'s `defaultValue` fallback were doing the rendering instead of a
 * real translation — `REGISTRY …` is what would appear, and the equality reports
 * it by name.
 *
 * The dotted members are their own case. The spec spells `setup.access`,
 * `setup.write` and `studio.access` with a dot; the keys spell them with an
 * underscore, and `labelFor` bridges that with `name.replace(/\./g, '_')`. The
 * transform is restated in this file ON PURPOSE rather than imported from the
 * widget: a pin that shares the implementation's own helper moves when the
 * implementation moves and pins nothing.
 *
 * ## PREDICTIONS, written before the run
 *
 * On this branch: all green. Against the pre-fix declaration (seven members, no
 * `capability.label.manage_sharing` key), expected RED on source parity, on the
 * `en`-coverage assertion, and on the two rendering assertions that name
 * `manage_sharing`; expected GREEN on the dotted-member, orphan and non-vacuity
 * assertions, which describe behaviour the seven-member list already had.

/**
 * The root `readVocabulary` resolves `module` against, derived from THIS FILE's
 * own location — never from the process cwd (objectui#7791).
 *
 * It was `'.'` until then, on the reasoning that cwd IS the repo root because
 * `scripts/vitest-invocation-guard.mjs` refuses any invocation whose vitest root
 * is not the repo root. That guard is real, but it is a DIFFERENT invariant:
 * `--root` moves VITEST's root and moves nothing about `process.cwd()`. This
 * package's own `test` script — `vitest run --root ../.. packages/fields/`,
 * which is what `pnpm --filter @object-ui/fields test` and `turbo run test` both
 * run — leaves cwd at `packages/fields/`, so the read resolved against the
 * package directory, missed, and `declaredMembers()` threw. Two of that
 * message's three disjuncts read as a regression in
 * `CapabilityMultiSelectField.tsx`, so the false RED actively sent its reader
 * hunting a defect that was not there. Measured on one tree with cwd as the only
 * variable: 7 passed from the repo root, 2 failed / 5 passed from the package
 * directory.
 *
 * `SELF_DEPTH_BELOW_REPO_ROOT` is the same walk the `readVocabulary` import above
 * already spells as `../../../../`, and what both ends of that gate already do:
 * `scriptDir` in `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs`, `repoRoot` in
 * `scripts/__tests__/check-i18n-call-site-keys.test.ts`. The pin now reaches one
 * verdict under every cwd, which is the property it always wanted.
 *
 * ## Why the derivation is spelled in string operations
 *
 * Both of the shorter spellings were MEASURED here and both are traps in this
 * package's `dom` project:
 *
 *   - `dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))` — the form the two files above
 *     use — does not type-check here. They are `.test.ts` in the `unit` project;
 *     this is a `.test.tsx`, and `tsconfig.test.json` names no `types` (see its
 *     header for why that is deliberate), so `node:path`/`node:url` are TS2591.
 *     A test file is not the place to change that program.
 *   - `new URL('../../../..', import.meta.url)` is a form VITE REWRITES. In this
 *     very file it evaluates to `http://localhost:3000/@fs/…`, a dev-server URL,
 *     under BOTH cwds — a false red would have become a suite that does not load
 *     at all. Bare `import.meta.url` is left alone by that transform, which is
 *     why it is read on its own and taken apart by hand.
 *
 * Skipping the case when the file cannot be read was never an option: a
 * conditional skip is how a case stops running on precisely the machines where
 * it would have fired.
