/**
 * Which authored `on*` keys reach a registered kanban board — measured, per
 * registration — and the guard that a bare deletion of one of them goes red on
 * (objectui#7664; the contract-review remediation of PR #7743).
 *
 * ## What went wrong, and why a hand-written ledger could not see it
 *
 * The first cut of this card removed `onCardClick` from the successor
 * `'kanban'` arm outright, on the recorded rationale "the object-bound board
 * owns the click". `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`, so a removed key is not
 * refused — it stops being judged and the value is KEPT. Measured on the built
 * dist at that head, `{ type: 'kanban', columns: [], onCardClick: { action:
 * 'toast' } }` went from REFUSED to ACCEPTED, with the value surviving into the
 * parsed output, while `onCardMove` / `onQuickAdd` / `onColumnAdd` /
 * `draggable` stayed REFUSED. Every ratchet stayed green because the #6124
 * ledger lists keys BY NAME and by hand: substituting one entry for another
 * holds its length constant and no assertion is derived from the read site.
 * Suite 3 below is that missing derivation.
 *
 * ## ⭐ What the 2026-09-09 family retirement did to this file
 *
 * Three of the four registrations this file measured RETIRED — the bare
 * `kanban` node key (objectui#8802) and the `kanban-ui` / `kanban-enhanced`
 * variants (objectui#8257) — and the zod `'kanban'` arm retired with the first
 * of them. ⛔ The MECHANISM the file exists to guard did not retire with them,
 * so the legs were re-based rather than deleted:
 *
 *   - the per-registration reachability probes collapse to the ONE surviving
 *     key, `'object-kanban'`;
 *   - `KanbanRenderer` is still a live component (`ObjectKanban` renders it),
 *     so its identity-forward probe is kept and driven DIRECTLY instead of
 *     through a registry key that no longer exists;
 *   - suite 3's derivation survives intact and its VERDICT flips, which is the
 *     honest reading: the three forwarded keys had exactly one declaring face,
 *     the `'kanban'` arm, and with the arm gone they have NONE. Recorded as an
 *     assertion so the state cannot drift back silently, and reported on the
 *     retirement PR rather than repaired here — declaring them on
 *     `ObjectKanbanSchema` would WIDEN a published accept set, which is a
 *     ruling and not a repair.
 *
 * ## ⭐ What objectui#7804 then did to suite 3
 *
 * The ruling arrived (director seat, decision batch #69, 2026-09-07) and the
 * dispositions were measured per key on this face. TWO landed —
 * `onCardClick` and `onQuickAdd`, both objectui#6124 RUNTIME SLOTS — so suite
 * 3's verdict flips a second time, and it is now spelled PER KEY: `onCardMove`
 * is still declared by nothing, because its authored value reaches neither
 * channel and the gate of record refuses the `'retired'` spelling while this
 * file's own forward block still reads the key. The separate per-key evidence
 * lives in `./handlerKeyDispositionsMeasured-7804.test.tsx`; what stays here is
 * the DERIVATION from the read site, which is the thing a re-key cannot hold
 * constant.
 *
 * ## Suite 1 — runtime reachability, per registration
 *
 * The two lazy board chunks are replaced by prop recorders; three spies are
 * authored on the schema; the question is which of them reach the board.
 *
 *   - `KanbanRenderer` rendered directly (`../index.tsx`): all three arrive BY
 *     IDENTITY. This is the probe whose controls are lit — `onCardMove` and
 *     `onQuickAdd`, both kept as #6124 runtime slots, come out live on it, and
 *     `onCardClick` comes out live beside them off the same forward block.
 *   - `'object-kanban'` (registered to `ObjectKanbanRenderer` → `ObjectKanban`
 *     → `KanbanRenderer`): `onQuickAdd` arrives by identity — the lit control
 *     ON THIS KEY, proving the schema-spread channel reaches the board here —
 *     while `onCardClick` AND `onCardMove` are BOTH replaced by
 *     `ObjectKanban`'s own functions (`ObjectKanban.tsx`, the
 *     `<KanbanRenderer schema={{ ...effectiveSchema, onCardClick: …,
 *     onCardMove: handleCardMove }} />` literal). The two keys have the SAME
 *     reachability here, so "`ObjectKanban` overrides it" cannot retire one
 *     without retiring the other.
 *
 * ## Suite 2 — the prop channel, which only `onCardClick` has
 *
 * `SchemaRenderer` spreads every non-metadata schema key as a React prop
 * (`packages/react/src/SchemaRenderer.tsx`, the `...componentProps` line of its
 * `createElement` call), and `ObjectKanbanComponentProps` DECLARES
 * `onCardClick` — there is no `onCardMove` prop. So on the `'object-kanban'` key an
 * authored `onCardClick` is not merely overridden: `ObjectKanban`'s own
 * wrapper CALLS it. Suite 2 invokes the function the board was handed and
 * measures that the authored one runs, with the identity check from suite 1 as
 * the control that the wrapper is genuinely interposed.
 *
 * ⇒ On every channel measured, `onCardClick` is at least as live as
 * `onCardMove`. Its #6124 disposition is RUNTIME SLOT, not `?: never`.
 *
 * ## Suite 3 — derived from the read site, so a deletion cannot hide
 *
 * The `schema.on*` reads inside `KanbanRenderer`'s body are extracted from
 * `../index.tsx`. Nothing here is a list a re-key can hold constant: the read
 * site is measured, and each key's declaration status on the surviving
 * `object-kanban` face is measured beside it.
 *
 * ## Predictions, written before the first run (red-first)
 *
 * On the tree before the remediation (`bd1fc7111` merged with `main`):
 *   - suites 1 and 2 pass unchanged — the forwards and the prop wiring are not
 *     what this card moved;
 *   - suite 3 fails on exactly one key, `onCardClick`: forwarded by
 *     `KanbanRenderer`, absent from `KanbanSchema.shape`.
