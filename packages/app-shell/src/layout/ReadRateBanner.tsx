/**
 * ReadRateBanner — the environment admin's standing read-rate report
 * (objectui#9954; ruling on cloud#2333, batch #164 item 3).
 *
 * ## What raises it
 *
 * `readRate.state === 'anomalous'` on `GET /api/v1/usage/storage`, and nothing
 * else. The control plane took that judgement once, in its own
 * `read-rate-anomaly` module; this component READS the verdict and never
 * re-derives it from the ratio and the threshold. Every other case — no reading
 * at all, a reading that is under the line, an endpoint that could not be read —
 * renders `null`, and {@link classifyReadRate} keeps those three apart so
 * "nobody measured it" can never be rendered, logged or reasoned about as
 * "measured and fine".
 *
 * ## Two anomalous cases, two sets of words
 *
 * An ABSENT `readsPerWrite` is not a missing number: it means the environment
 * made no writes at all, so the ratio has no upper bound — the most severe
 * reading there is, and the exact shape of the incident behind this work
 * (cloud#2179: 101.16 billion rows read in nine days, unnoticed). Rendering it
 * as an em dash, or hiding the banner because a number was missing, would hide
 * the worst case. It gets its own title, its own sentence and the heavier tone.
 *
 * The threshold in both sentences comes from `ratioThreshold` on the wire.
 * There is ⛔ no copy of the line in this repo.
 *
 * ## It is a REPORT, and may never become anything else
 *
 * Verbatim from the landed cloud module this reads:
 *
 *   > Nothing downstream may turn this into a refusal, a throttle or a degraded
 *   > read. Option B was rejected on the record (cloud#2179), and this endpoint
 *   > is read-only in any case — but the banner it feeds must not become an
 *   > argument for the guardrail beside it.
 *
 * So: no gate, no throttle, no upgrade CTA, no disabled control. The copy says
 * in as many words that nothing is limited or blocked.
 *
 * ## Where it mounts, and who sees it
 *
 * `ConsoleShell`, beside `ImpersonationBanner` — the one provider stack every
 * console route passes through, so `/home` carries it too. `ConsoleLayout` was
 * the alternative and is wrong here for the reason that module already records:
 * it wraps only `/apps/*`, and an admin sitting on home would see nothing. The
 * notification banner host (`ConsoleNotificationBanners`) was the other
 * candidate and is wrong for a different reason — it renders notifications
 * RAISED through the spec notification system, and this reading is neither a
 * notification nor raised by anything in this app.
 *
 * The audience is the environment's own admin — the only person who can act on
 * their own app's read pattern. Gated on `useWorkspaceAdminStatus`, which also
 * keeps the request itself off every ordinary session rather than spending a
 * 403 per page load.
