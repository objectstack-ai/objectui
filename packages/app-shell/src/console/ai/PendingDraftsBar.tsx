/**
 * Standing "unpublished changes" affordance for the AI build surface
 * (objectui#5694).
 *
 * Before this bar, the ONLY way to publish a pending draft was the inline
 * 「发布 (N)」 button on whichever tool card staged it — buried however far up
 * the transcript the conversation had scrolled. In the 2026-08-22 staging E2E
 * (cloud#1584) a dashboard sat `state='draft'` through three repair rounds
 * with a working publish button off-screen the whole time; the user's actual
 * experience was a live menu entry answering 「未找到仪表板」.
 *
 * This bar floats above the composer while the conversation's bound package
 * has pending drafts: it survives scrolling, publishes through the SAME
 * governed path as the inline button and the Home banner
 * (`POST /packages/:id/publish-drafts` — the path that orders
 * structure-before-seeds and runs the ADR-0038 L3 probes), narrates probe
 * findings via the shared {@link publishHealthFromResponse} instead of a blind
 * "Published!", and disappears when the count reaches zero.
 *
 * objectui#10039 — that publish now goes through `MetadataClient`, not a bare
 * `fetch`. The route answers the runtime authoring gate's per-draft advisories
 * on each `published[]` element (objectstack#9343) and the client is the seam
 * that reports them: it emits one advisory event per advised item into the
 * same sink, renderer and wording every other write door uses. A bare fetch
 * had nothing to report THROUGH, so every one of those findings was parsed by
 * nobody — while the probe findings a few lines below were already shouting.
 * objectui#6965 / PR objectui#10038 did this for the two sibling call sites;
 * this is the same move, not a second mechanism.
 *
 * Count freshness: re-read when the package binding changes and whenever the
 * turn goes idle (`idle` flips true) — tool results that stage or publish
 * drafts land inside a turn, so idle edges are exactly when the count can
 * have changed. Sibling surfaces: `preview/UnpublishedAppBar` (the ADR-0045
 * app-level publish gate — a DIFFERENT axis: an app can be live while sibling
 * artifacts are draft, which is exactly the case above) and the Home
 * pending-drafts banner (environment-wide, not package-scoped).
