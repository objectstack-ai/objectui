/**
 * What `DetailSection`'s click-to-copy WRITES, per field kind (objectui#8395).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `handleCopyField` built its payload with `String(value)`, and `String()` of an
 * object is the literal text `[object Object]`. The affordance is offered for
 * every non-empty value (`canCopy` is `hasCellValue`, objectui#8376) — objects
 * included — so a reader clicking the copy button, the row, or pressing Enter on
 * an address, geolocation, JSON, file, expanded-lookup, repeater or image cell
 * got a placeholder on the clipboard **while the cell beside the button rendered
 * that same value correctly**. Nothing errors; it is noticed only on paste.
 *
 * ## What this file pins — BOTH halves
 *
 * 1. **The fix.** Every object-valued kind copies parseable JSON of the STORED
 *    value. Each such case also asserts the cell RENDERED its value, because
 *    "the payload is not `[object Object]`" is satisfied by a cell that rendered
 *    nothing and copied nothing — an implementation strictly worse than the bug.
 *    Nothing here asserts a negation; every row asserts its exact payload.
 * 2. ⭐ **The non-regression.** The scalar kinds that were already correct stay
 *    BYTE-IDENTICAL, and each of those cases asserts the rendered text too, so
 *    the pin is red for any future "just copy what the cell renders" rewrite.
 *    That shape was measured and rejected on this card: it is the worse contract
 *    for 9 of 17 field types (`date` renders `Mar 4` — the year is gone;
 *    `percent` renders `12%` against a stored `0.123`; `image` and `boolean`
 *    render no text at all, so they would copy the empty string).
 *
 * ## The contract status of the JSON blob
 *
 * A JSON blob is a DEFENSIBLE DEFAULT, not a settled contract — see the read
 * site's docblock. The per-kind contract (a formatted postal address, `lat,
 * lng`, a filename …) is objectui#8395's option B, a separate card. These cases
 * pin today's answer so a future option-B change is a deliberate edit here.
 *
 * ## Instruments
 *
 * - What is observed is the ARGUMENT to `navigator.clipboard.writeText`, spied
 *   through `Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'clipboard', …)` — the pattern
 *   `app-shell/src/console/organizations/__tests__/acceptInvitationLink.mount.test.tsx`
 *   already uses. There is no `execCommand` fallback on this path.
 * - ⚠️ The clickable row is found by `[role="button"]`, NEVER by
 *   `querySelector('button')`: `BooleanCellRenderer` renders a Radix Checkbox,
 *   which IS a `button` element, so that selector matches the checkbox instead
 *   of the copy button and the click copies nothing. Pinned below.
 * - `window.innerWidth` is 1280: `DetailSection` has mobile and desktop row
 *   shapes and an `isMobile` auto-hide threshold.
 * - Presence is read through `queryByText` into `expect(value, message)`, never
 *   `getByText`, so a missing row fails with the reason rather than with
 *   `TestingLibraryElementError` before `expect` runs.
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT pinned here
 *
 * The `password` / `secret` branch of this same handler — copy writes the raw
 * secret while the cell renders the mask — is objectui#8440, in the maintainer's
 * decision box. This card leaves that path exactly as it found it, and asserts
 * nothing about it, so whichever way #8440 is answered no case here turns red.
