/**
 * The minimal app shape THESE ROUTE HELPERS read.
 *
 * ⚠️ Renamed off `AppLike` at objectui#7265, and the rename is the fix rather
 * than a workaround. `@objectstack/spec/system` exports an `AppLike` of its own:
 * the minimal app document `translateApp` consumes — `{ name, label,
 * description, navigation }` with `name` REQUIRED — i.e. the keys the
 * TRANSLATOR reads. These helpers read a disjoint set for a different purpose,
 * and adopting the spec's shape would make this module worse in both
 * directions:
 *
 *   - `_packageId` is the ADR-0048 route key and the FIRST thing every function
 *     here reads. The spec's shape does not declare it; it would arrive through
 *     that shape's `[key: string]: any`, i.e. as `any`, taking the
 *     `typeof packageId !== 'string'` guard in `studioPackageId` with it. Same
 *     for `active` / `hidden`, which `filterActiveApps` reads;
 *   - `name` is optional here on purpose. `resolveHostAppSegment`'s documented
 *     step 4 exists FOR "the degenerate app carrying neither `_packageId` nor
 *     `name`", so a required `name` would assert away the one case that branch
 *     was written to serve.
 *
 * `unknown` (not `string`) on both members is deliberate for the same reason the
 * guards exist: these helpers are handed apps straight out of the metadata
 * catalog and must narrow before using either. `spec-symbol-parity.test.ts`
 * holds the two-way ratchet on the rename.

 * business user without access to the setup app, and an unannounced app switch
 * for everyone else — both measured in a browser on objectui#4074.
 *
 * Resolution order, each step falling through only when the previous one cannot
 * name an app the user can actually open:
 *   1. `preferred` — the app they are in, or last had open — RE-CHECKED against
 *      the live active list, so an app that was deactivated or hidden since is

 *   2. their first active app — arbitrary but reachable, and on a business
 *      user's workspace that is a business app rather than `setup`;
 *   3. `preferred` unchecked, but ONLY when the list names no app at all. An
 *      empty list means "not loaded yet" (the pre-catalog render, or a consumer
 *      outside `MetadataProvider`) at least as often as it means "this user has
 *      no apps", and demoting a user who is demonstrably rendering inside
 *      `/apps/{preferred}/…` to `setup` would reintroduce the very defect this
 *      resolves. A caller with a genuinely empty workspace has no reachable app
 *      to offer anyway;
 *   4. `setup`. What is left is the degenerate app carrying neither
 *      `_packageId` nor `name` — nothing addressable to build a URL from — so
 *      the historical target is the least-surprising last resort rather than a
 *      broken link.
 *
 * Note step 1 takes ONE `preferred` hint: callers inside the `/apps/:appName/*`
 * router pass `currentAppName ?? params.appName` (the shell's published app,
 * then the URL's own segment); Home renders outside that router and has only
 * `currentAppName`, which is stale by construction — hence the re-check.

/**
 * Where a notification's `action_url` should actually take the user
 * (objectui#5179).
 *
 * ## The contract this reads
 *
 * `action_url` is **app-relative**, and the producer says so in as many words.
 * `service-messaging`'s `actionUrlFor()` takes an explicit `payload.url` when
 * one is given, and otherwise synthesizes `/{object}/{id}` from the emit's
 * `source` "so the materialization is self-sufficient for navigation (the bell
 * no longer has the L2 event's `source_object/source_id` to fall back on —
 * ADR-0030 L5)". Its own pins carry that shape: `/showcase_task/t_42`,
 * `/opportunities/42`.
 *
 * So the field names a RECORD, not a console route. Which app hosts it is the
 * client's question — the same one {@link resolveHostAppSegment} answers for
 * `sys_inbox_message` and `sys_activity`, and for the same reason: notifications
 * are app-independent, so the app segment in the URL is a statement about WHERE
 * THE USER IS.
 *
 * Navigating the field verbatim is what objectui#5179 reported. `/showcase_task/t_42`
 * matches no route, so the console's catch-all (`<Route path="*" element={<Navigate
 * to="/" replace />} />`) forwards it to `/`, and `RootLandingRedirect` resolves
 * that to `/apps/<default app>` — the app landing page. Mark-as-read has already
 * fired by then, so the user's pointer to the record is not misdirected but gone.
 *
 * ## Why a resolver rather than a prefix at each call site
 *
 * Both producers of this navigation — Home's action centre and the top-bar bell
 * — had their own answer, and the two disagreed with each other AND with the
 * two "see all" drills sitting in the same files. One resolver is what makes
 * them incapable of drifting again; it is the same argument objectui#4074 made
 * for `resolveHostAppSegment` one screen up.
 *
 * ## The three shapes, and why each is distinguished
 *
 * - **external** (`https://…`, or any other scheme) — a producer-supplied
 *   `payload.url` pointing off-console. It must never be hosted: prefixing
 *   would build `/apps/crm/https://…`, a route that does not exist. The caller
 *   decides how to open it, because "new tab" is a UI decision, not a routing one.
 * - **already a console route** (`/apps/…`) — an explicit `payload.url` that has
 *   already named its app. Hosting it twice (`/apps/crm/apps/acme/…`) would
 *   break the one case that worked before this fix.
 * - **app-relative** (everything else) — the synthesized `/{object}/{id}`, and
 *   the case this exists for. Hosted under `hostAppSegment`.
 *
 * Returns `null` for an absent or blank url, so callers keep their own fallback
 * (Home opens the full inbox; the bell has no link to follow) rather than
 * receiving a fabricated target. A protocol-relative `//host/path` counts as
 * external — it is a URL to another origin, whatever the current scheme.
