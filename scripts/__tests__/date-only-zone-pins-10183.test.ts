/**
 * objectui#10183 — drives the date-only zone pins, which cannot drive
 * themselves.
 *
 * ## What the pins are
 *
 * objectui#10110 moved the date-only repair into the shared parse step
 * (`toDisplayDate` in `@object-ui/core`). Four sites never reached it, and
 * each read `2026-08-01` as July 31st west of UTC: `data-table`'s default
 * cell face (and through it a related list with no child schema), the record
 * summary chip, the History tab's date faces and the `date` cell's overdue
 * colouring. Each has a pin beside it, listed in {@link PINS}.
 * objectui#10293 added a fifth under the same convention: the `ui:calendar`
 * primitive's selected date, which the renderer now coerces through the same
 * shared step. objectui#10844, the family's closure card, added the dashboard
 * filter's custom range bounds, the `date-picker` renderer's value and the
 * report cell's date face. objectui#10866, its successor, added the calendar
 * and the gantt, whose pins also hold the written payload of a `date` field,
 * then the timeline, a chart's date axis and `@object-ui/i18n`'s published
 * date helpers, then the timeline's gantt axis and core's formula date
 * arithmetic, then the calendar's day moves across a DST change and the pins
 * for the calendar's end-date write, its no-schema fallback and the gantt's
 * no-schema path. objectui#11005 added the month grid's own drags, which move
 * a value by calendar days across a DST change. A later date-only read site
 * registers here the same way.
 *
 * ## Why a driver, and why the forks pool
 *
 * The zone is those pins' input, and this suite runs in UTC — the one offset
 * where the defect is invisible (`vitest.config.mts` pins it, objectui#8366).
 * ⚠️ Writing `process.env.TZ` inside a test of the normal run does NOT move
 * the zone: the root config runs `pool: 'threads'`, a worker thread's
 * `process.env` is a plain copy with no native setter, and `Intl` keeps
 * reading UTC. Measured while writing these pins: the same assignment in the
 * same test file resolved `America/Los_Angeles` on `--pool=forks` and `UTC`
 * on the default pool. A forked worker is a real process's MAIN thread, where
 * Node's `TZ` setter resets the zone. ⚠️ Nor can the zone be handed to a child
 * vitest in its environment: loading the root config re-pins `UTC` before any
 * worker starts, which is exactly what `vitest-timezone-pin-8366.test.ts`
 * spawns a vitest to prove. So the pins set the zone themselves, per case,
 * and only a forked child can run them.
 *
 * Each pin is therefore skipped in the normal run and runs only here: one
 * vitest over every file in {@link PINS}, `--pool=forks`, with
 * `OBJECTUI_DATE_ZONE_CHILD=1`. Every zone in every pin opens with a rig case
 * — the zone `Intl` resolved, and the local hour of a fixed instant — so a
 * child whose zone did not move reds inside the child.
 *
 * ## What this file asserts, and why "ran" is half of it
 *
 * Reading the child's JSON report, per pin: the file was collected, it ran at
 * least one case, and every case PASSED — skipped counts as failure. A child
 * that stopped honouring the flag would skip every case, exit 0 and say
 * nothing; that is the silent shape this rules out. One spawn, not one per pin,
 * because the spawn is the whole cost.
