 * chart-presentation — the AUTHORED half of a dataset-bound chart, lowered onto
 * the bindings {@link buildChartSeries} derived from the dataset selection.
 *
 * `chart-series.ts` beside this file owns the DATA half: which columns become
 * series, which rows, which buckets. This file owns everything the author gets
 * to say about how that data LOOKS — the ruled data/presentation split of
 * objectui#4229, stated once:
 *
 *  - **Data (derived, never forwarded)** — series MEMBERSHIP and the column each
 *    binding reads. Concretely `buildChartSeries`' `dataKey`s, `xAxisKey`, and
 *    the spec's two binding keys `ChartSeries.name` and `ChartAxis.field`.
 *  - **Presentation (authored, merged forward)** — everything else on those same
 *    objects: `series[].type` (the per-series mark), `series[].yAxis` (which
 *    axis it binds to), `label`/`color`/`stack`/`variant`/`dashArray`/`opacity`,
 *    the axis definitions' `title`/`format`/`min`/`max`/`stepSize`/
 *    `showGridLines`/`position`/`logarithmic`, and the chart chrome
 *    (`showLegend`, `showDataLabels`, `colors`, `annotations`, …).
 *
 * ## Why it lives in `@object-ui/core` rather than in one plugin
 *
 * It was written for `plugin-dashboard`'s `DatasetWidget` (#3135 → objectstack#7016
 * → #4229) and lifted here by objectui#4877, when `plugin-report`'s embedded
 * report chart turned out to need the SAME merge over the same spec shapes: the
 * report was forwarding six keys and dropping every authored chrome key the
 * schema declares, and re-deriving this beside the dashboard's copy is exactly
 * the duplication objectui#4389 filed as a defect (two longhand copies of the
 * analytics label net, one per plugin, drifting apart).
 *
 * Everything here is a pure data transform over plain records, so it sits below
 * both plugins with no React and no i18n — the same layering `chart-series.ts`
 * already has (see {@link OptionLabelTranslator} there for why an i18n-resolved
 * string always arrives as an ARGUMENT rather than being read here).
 *
 * ## Two entry points, because the two surfaces declare axes differently
 *
 * A dashboard widget's `chartConfig` spells its axes as spec `ChartAxis`
 * OBJECTS. A report's `chart.xAxis` / `chart.yAxis` are bare dimension/measure
 * NAME strings — on that surface the axes are pure DATA (they ARE the selection)
 * and carry no presentation at all. So:
 *
 *  - {@link mergeAuthoredPresentation} is the object-axis entry point: series
 *    merge + axis presentation, for a caller whose axes are `ChartAxis` objects.
 *  - {@link mergeAuthoredSeries} is the series merge ALONE, for a caller whose
 *    axes are names. That split is structural, not a guard: handing a bare
 *    string to {@link mergeAuthoredPresentation} would run it through
 *    `axisPresentation`, which reads nothing off a string and would synthesise a
 *    `yAxis: [{}]` entry — a y-axis declaring nothing but its own existence,
 *    which is precisely how the COUNT of entries turns on a secondary axis. A
 *    surface that cannot author axis presentation should not be able to reach
 *    the code that reads it.

/**
 * An authored `I18nLabel` that travels to the renderer **unresolved** — the
 * chart's own `title` / `subtitle` / `description` (objectui#9038).
 *
 * ## Why this does not resolve, and why that is not {@link labelText}'s answer
 *
 * These three keys are lowered onto a chart SCHEMA slot that already declares
 * the union: `normalizeChartSchema` (`@object-ui/plugin-charts`) resolves
 * `title`/`subtitle`/`description` through `pickLocalized` with the viewer's
 * language, which `ChartRenderer` reads from `useObjectTranslation` and hands
 * down (objectui#8943), and `ObjectChart` reads `schema.title` through the same
 * resolver for its drill heading. So the value's one resolution point is
 * already downstream of here, holding the one thing this package does not have
 * — the viewer. Forwarding is what lets that resolver see the value at all.
 *
 * Resolving here is not merely unnecessary, it is unavailable: `pickLocalized`
 * lives in `@object-ui/i18n`, which DEPENDS on this package. Declaring the
 * reverse edge makes the build graph cyclic (measured: `turbo run build
 * --filter=@object-ui/core` refuses with `Cyclic dependency detected`), and
 * that package's entry point is a React provider plus hooks — the layering
 * this file's header states, arrived at from the other side.
 *
 * ⛔ Do NOT "fix" this by reusing {@link labelText}. The two answer different
 * questions and only one of them is a choice:
 *
 *  - `labelText` is a locale-unaware PICK for a slot whose consumer takes a
 *    plain string. It is wrong for a zh console and is ledgered as such
 *    (objectui#4020) because a caller that CAN resolve the language overrides
 *    the merged label — the mitigation depends on the value still existing.
 *  - The guard this replaced (`typeof v === 'string' && v ? v : undefined`)
 *    offered no such route: it ERASED the map arm, the `if (title)` guard then
 *    skipped the assignment, and the chart drew **no heading at all**, in every
 *    language, with no diagnostic. Nothing downstream could override a key that
 *    never arrived.
 *
 * ## The admission test, and what it deliberately does not decide
 *
 * A plain string, or a record carrying at least one usable string entry. That
 * is the same "is there anything here" question the `if (title)` truthiness
 * guard always asked, extended to the map arm — it does NOT decide which limb
 * wins, which stays `pickLocalized`'s alone. Everything else (a number, a
 * boolean, an array, `''`, `{}`, a record with no string value) is refused
 * exactly as before, so no key reaches the caller that cannot render, and the
 * `@returns` contract below — only keys that resolved — still holds.
 *
 * The map is forwarded VERBATIM: `InlineLocaleMapSchema` is
 * `z.record(<tag>, z.string())` and enforcing that belongs at the parse, not in
 * a renderer-side coercion (AGENTS.md #0.1). A non-string entry falls through
 * `pickLocalized`'s limbs exactly as an absent one does, which is why admitting
 * the record on the strength of one usable entry cannot paint `[object
 * Object]`.

/**
 * Lower an authored chart config's CHROME (spec `ChartConfigSchema` /
 * `ReportChartSchema` — the same keys on both) onto the chart schema a
 * dataset-bound surface hands the renderer.
 *
 * ## Why this is a whitelist and not a spread
 *
 * Until #3135 NONE of a dashboard widget's `chartConfig` reached the renderer:
 * the widget read `options` and nothing else, so an author who wrote
 * `showLegend: false` still got a legend and one who wrote `true` only got one
 * because "on" is the renderer's default. #3135 lowered that single flag and
 * left the rest declared and inert. objectstack#7016 lowered the rest of the
 * keys that are actually DELIVERED, admitting a key only when both of these
 * hold:
 *
 *  1. **The chart block draws it end to end.** `{ type: 'chart' }` resolves to
 *     `ChartRenderer` → `AdvancedChartImpl`, which draws `title`/`subtitle` in
 *     its ChartFrame, turns `description` into the chart container's
 *     `role="img"` + `aria-label`, applies `height` as that container's inline
 *     height, reads `colors` as the positional palette, prints
 *     `showDataLabels` as a Recharts `LabelList`, draws `annotations` as
 *     ReferenceLine/ReferenceArea and honours `interaction` as the tooltip
 *     toggle plus `Brush`. Forwarding a key the renderer ignores would only
 *     move declared-but-not-delivered one layer down, which is the failure this
 *     exists to remove.
 *  2. **It does not fight the dataset derivation.** `type` stays out: the
 *     calling surface's own type already picks the chart family, which is the
 *     dataset path's chart-family channel.
 *
 * `aria` is the one declared key with **no reader at all**: `AdvancedChartImpl`
 * has no `aria` prop, and `SchemaRenderer`'s ARIA injection reads the FLAT
 * `ariaLabel`/`ariaDescribedBy`/`role`, never a nested `aria` object. It is
 * therefore left unforwarded on purpose (criterion 1) rather than papered over
 * with a caller-side flattening that would also collide with the accessible
 * name `description` already sets — reported back to objectstack#5175's
 * narrowing half instead.
 *
 * `title` IS emitted here. A caller that paints the title itself (the report
 * renderer's own `h3` above the chart) must drop it from the result, or the
 * chart draws a second one.
 *
 * ## `title` / `subtitle` / `description` are `I18nLabel`, and travel as such
 *
 * `ChartConfigSchema` types all three as the spec's `I18nLabel` union — a plain
 * string OR an inline locale map — so all three are lowered by
 * {@link forwardedI18nLabel}, which hands the authored value on untouched for
 * the renderer to resolve against the viewer's language. Read that helper for
 * why resolving cannot happen in this package.
 *
 * ⚠️ LEDGERED, by name, as still unresolved after objectui#9038 — not in
 * that card's scope and not reached by the change above:
 *
 *  - **A series `label` and an axis `title`** still go through
 *    {@link labelText}'s first-string-wins pick, the design objectui#4020
 *    ledgered and a caller can override. Not reopened here.
 *
 * ✓ CLEARED, objectui#9150 — **the report renderer's own heading.**
 * `DatasetReportChart` (`@object-ui/plugin-report`) still drops `title` from
 * this result and still paints its own `h3`, but that read site no longer
 * narrows `chart.title` to a plain string: it resolves the union through
 * `pickLocalized` against the viewer's language, like every other `I18nLabel`
 * on that surface. Kept here rather than deleted because the ledger entry is
 * what the fixing card was dispatched from, and because the FIRST half of it —
 * that a caller painting the title itself must drop `title` from this result —
 * is a live constraint on this whitelist, stated above.
 *
 * @param raw the authored chart config (anything, incl. absent)
 * @param fieldCategoryColors per-category colours resolved from the category
 *   dimension's own select/lookup option colours, merged UNDER an explicit
 *   author map (see the `colors` note below)
