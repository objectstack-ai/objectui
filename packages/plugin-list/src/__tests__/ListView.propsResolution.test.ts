 * objectui#4528 — COMPILE-TIME pins on the props a `ListView` JSX call site is
 * actually held to.
 *
 * These assertions are erased at runtime; `tsc` is the only thing that can
 * check them, which is why this file is carried by
 * `packages/plugin-list/tsconfig.test.json` and why the `expect` below is
 * deliberately trivial — the real assertions are the `Assert< Equal< … > >`
 * types, and a violation is a compile error, not a red test.
 *
 * ## What was measured before the fix
 *
 * The card objectui#4528 asserted this package's shape BY INSPECTION rather
 * than by measurement. It was then measured, on the pre-fix source, compiled
 * through this same project — and matched the sibling package exactly:
 *
 *     keyof React.ComponentProps< typeof ListView >   ->  string | number
 *     React.ComponentProps< typeof ListView >['onRowClick']  ->  any
 *     ListViewProps['onRowClick']  ->  ((record: Record< string, unknown >) => void) | undefined
 *
 * `ListViewProps` carried a `[key: string]: any`, which puts `string` into
 * `keyof Props`, so React's `PropsWithoutRef` took its `Omit` branch and `Omit`
 * over a string index signature keeps ONLY the index signature. The interface
 * declared the contract and no consumer was held to it. The pins below are
 * exactly those reads, in their fixed direction.

//    Before the fix this was `any`, so a wrong-typed handler — and any prop
//    typo next to it — passed silently.
//
//    ⭐ MOVED BY objectui#9357, and this pin is how that move was noticed. The
//    second parameter is the modifier payload `useNavigationOverlay`'s
//    `handleClick` has always invoked this prop with — `ListView` passes the
//    prop straight into that option — and the declaration used to name only the
//    record. Note what caught it: `Equal` is exact identity, so it reds on a
//    widening that `extends` would have waved through in BOTH directions. Note
//    also WHERE it was caught — `tsc`, never vitest, which erases every line
//    above `describe`. This package's 77 test files stayed green across the
//    change.

//    this pin was `true` — measured, and it is the whole defect in one line.

// 8. objectui#8106 — the two callbacks the #4528 sweep left at `any`, pinned
//    at the type their emit sites actually fire with. Both were measured at the
//    CALL SITE, not read off the declaration, and they are asymmetric on
//    purpose: `sort` crosses `emitSortChange`, whose two legs are the array it
//    is handed and `filterPlatformSortableSort`'s return — generic in the
//    element, so `SortItem[]` either way; `filters` is the toolbar
//    `FilterBuilder`'s own `onChange` value passed straight through, which is
//    why it is the builder's `FilterGroup` and NOT the later query-path AST.
//
//    The `IsAny` halves are the discriminating ones, exactly as in pin 2: a
//    re-widening to `any` must fail loudly here rather than silently
//    re-admitting every shape the way it did before objectui#8106.
