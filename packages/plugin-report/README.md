# @object-ui/plugin-report

Report components for Object UI — render, view and export reports, with scheduling support. Report *authoring* is not part of this package.

## Features

- 🧩 **Four spec report variants** — `tabular` / `summary` / `matrix` / `joined`, dispatched by a single `<ReportRenderer schema={...}>`
- 🧮 **Server-side aggregation** — a dataset-bound report selects measures by name through `dataSource.queryDataset`; totals come back pre-aggregated (ADR-0021)
- 📅 **Period pivots** — the across axis is a dimension the dataset declares at the grain it needs; a report buckets nothing itself
- 🪜 **Multi-level grouping + totals** — row subtotals, column subtotals and grand total for `matrix`, a grand-total footer for `summary`, all server-computed
- 🎯 **Cell drill-down** — aggregated rows and matrix cells emit `DatasetDrillArgs` to the host's `onDrill` callback; the host owns navigation (ADR-0021 D2)
- 🧱 **Joined reports** — vertically stacked sub-reports; each block names its own `dataset`, filter and ordering
- 🎨 **Type-aware cells** — the presentation-layer `ReportViewer` renders `select` → Badge, `lookup` → link, `boolean` → ✓/✗, `email`/`url`/`phone` → links, `image` → thumbnail
- 🖨️ **Multi-format export** — CSV, JSON, HTML, PDF, Excel; live-data and Excel-formula variants
- 📦 **Auto-registered** — components register with `ComponentRegistry` on import; embed via `{ "type": "spec-report", "report": {...} }`

## Installation

npm install @object-ui/plugin-report
```

**Peer Dependencies:**

- `react-dom` ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0

## Quick Start

`ReportRenderer` is the one entry point — a dispatcher that routes any report
shape to the right renderer. It takes the report as `schema`; there is no
report-authoring component in this package (see
[Legacy presentation layer](#legacy-presentation-layer)).

```tsx
import { ReportRenderer } from '@object-ui/plugin-report';
import type { DataSource } from '@object-ui/types';

// `dataSource` and `router` are host-provided.
declare const dataSource: DataSource;
declare const router: { push: (href: string) => void };

function ReportPage() {
  return (
    <ReportRenderer
      schema={{
        name: 'opp_by_stage',
        type: 'summary',
        dataset: 'opportunity_pipeline',
        rows: ['stage'],
        values: ['amount_sum', 'deal_count'],
      }}
      dataSource={dataSource}
      onDrill={({ object }) => router.push(`/records/${object}`)}
    />
  );
}
```

The dataset-bound renderer can also be addressed directly when the host has
already decided the shape — it takes the report as `report`, not `schema`:

```tsx
import { DatasetReportRenderer, isDatasetReport } from '@object-ui/plugin-report';
import type { DataSource } from '@object-ui/types';

// `stored` is whatever the host loaded; `dataSource` is host-provided.
declare const stored: unknown;
declare const dataSource: DataSource;

function StoredReportPage() {
  if (isDatasetReport(stored)) {
    return <DatasetReportRenderer report={stored} dataSource={dataSource} />;
  }
  return null;
}
```

`ReportViewer` renders a presentation-layer report, and takes a whole
`ReportViewerSchema` as `schema` — `report` / `showToolbar` are keys *inside*
that schema, not props of the component:

```tsx
import { ReportViewer } from '@object-ui/plugin-report';
import type { ReportComponentSchema } from '@object-ui/types';

// All three are host-provided.
declare const reportDefinition: ReportComponentSchema;
declare const rows: Array<Record<string, unknown>>;
declare const refetch: () => void;

function LegacyReportPage() {
  return (
    <ReportViewer
      schema={{ type: 'report-viewer', report: reportDefinition, data: rows, showToolbar: true }}
      onRefresh={refetch}
    />
  );
}
```

## Spec Reports — the four variants

A report is **dataset-bound**: it names a semantic-layer `dataset` and selects
that dataset's measures (`values`) grouped by its dimensions (`rows`, and for a
matrix also `columns`). Every name in a report is a name the dataset defines —
the report declares no object, no field, no aggregate and no date bucket of its
own. `defineReport` validates at authoring time and returns the parsed shape
`ReportRenderer` takes as `schema`:

```tsx
import { defineReport } from '@objectstack/spec/ui';
import { ReportRenderer } from '@object-ui/plugin-report';
import type { DataSource } from '@object-ui/types';

// `ds` is host-provided.
declare const ds: DataSource;

const report = defineReport({
  name: 'opp_by_stage',
  label: 'Opportunities by Stage',
  type: 'summary',
  dataset: 'opportunity_pipeline',
  rows: ['stage'],
  values: ['amount_sum', 'deal_count'],
  order: [{ by: 'amount_sum', direction: 'desc' }],
});

<ReportRenderer schema={report} dataSource={ds} />
```

| Key             | Type                                           | Meaning                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`          | `string` (required)                            | Identifier, at least 2 characters.                                |
| `label`         | `string` \| `Record< string, string >` (required) | Display title; the record form is the i18n shape.              |
| `type`          | `tabular` \| `summary` \| `matrix` \| `joined` | Defaults to `tabular`.                                          |
| `dataset`       | `string`                                       | The dataset this report reads.                                    |
| `rows`          | `string[]`                                     | Dimension **names** to group down.                                |
| `columns`       | `string[]`                                     | Dimension **names** across — the matrix pivot axis.               |
| `values`        | `string[]`                                     | Measure **names** to display.                                     |
| `runtimeFilter` | filter condition                               | Scope filter, merged with the filter the host passes at render.    |
| `order`         | `{ by, direction }[]`                          | Result ordering, most significant key first.                      |
| `drilldown`     | `boolean`                                      | Defaults to `true`.                                               |
| `chart`         | object                                         | Embedded visualization over the same selection.                   |
| `blocks`        | report[]                                       | `joined` only — the stacked sub-reports.                          |

The schema is **strict**: a key it does not declare is rejected, not ignored.

| `type`    | Description                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tabular` | The selection as a flat list — `rows` + `values`, no totals                     |
| `summary` | The same table plus a server-computed grand-total footer                        |
| `matrix`  | Cross-tab: `rows` down × `columns` across, measures in the cells, plus subtotals |
| `joined`  | A vertical stack of blocks, each its own dataset-bound table                    |

The **declared type** picks the presentation — never the shape of the data that
comes back.

### Matrix (row × column pivot)

`columns` is a second list of dimension **names**, used as the across axis:

```ts
import { defineReport } from '@objectstack/spec/ui';

defineReport({
  name: 'pipeline_by_quarter',
  label: 'Pipeline Coverage by Quarter',
  type: 'matrix',
  dataset: 'opportunity_pipeline',
  rows: ['forecast_category'],
  columns: ['close_quarter'],
  values: ['amount_sum'],
});
```

`close_quarter` is a time dimension the **dataset** declares at that grain. A
report cannot bucket a date itself: the grain a measure is valid at belongs to
the semantic layer, not to one report. A `matrix` with no `columns` degrades to
the flat grouped table.

### Joined

```ts
import { defineReport } from '@objectstack/spec/ui';

defineReport({
  name: 'churn_signals',
  label: 'Customer Churn Signals',
  type: 'joined',
  blocks: [
    {
      name: 'at_risk',
      label: 'At-Risk Accounts',
      type: 'summary',
      dataset: 'account_health',
      rows: ['industry'],
      values: ['account_count'],
      runtimeFilter: { is_active: true },
    },
    {
      name: 'lost',
      label: 'Recently Lost',
      type: 'summary',
      dataset: 'opportunity_pipeline',
      rows: ['owner'],
      values: ['amount_sum'],
      runtimeFilter: { stage: 'closed_lost' },
    },
  ],
});
```

Block rules: every block names its **own** `dataset` (there is no container
dataset to inherit); the container's `runtimeFilter` is merged into each block
and the block's own keys win; each block orders itself through its own `order`;
a block's declared `type` picks its presentation; `block.type` must not be
`joined` (no recursion).

### Ordering

`order` is a list, most significant key first, lowered onto the dataset
selection so the **server** orders the query — which is why ordering by a
derived measure works and the sort applies to the whole result rather than to
one fetched page. `by` names a dimension the report groups by or a measure it
displays. For a matrix the across axis reads left-to-right in row-arrival
order, so ordering by the across dimension is what fixes the column order;
declaring nothing still reads correctly, because a selected time dimension
defaults to ascending.

### Embedded chart

`chart.type` is one of the spec's chart names; `xAxis` / `yAxis` are **bare
dimension and measure names** from the report's own selection, not field paths
and not expressions:

```ts
import { defineReport } from '@objectstack/spec/ui';

defineReport({
  name: 'pipeline_by_stage',
  label: 'Pipeline by Stage',
  type: 'summary',
  dataset: 'opportunity_pipeline',
  rows: ['stage'],
  values: ['amount_sum'],
  chart: {
    type: 'bar',
    title: 'Pipeline by Stage',
    xAxis: 'stage',
    yAxis: 'amount_sum',
    showLegend: false,
  },
});
```

`series`, `colors`, `height`, `showDataLabels`, `annotations` and `interaction`
are passed through to the chart as authored.

## Server-side aggregation + drill-down

A dataset-bound report selects its dimensions (`rows`, and for `matrix` also
`columns`) and measures (`values`) **by name** and runs them through
`dataSource.queryDataset` — the same governed semantic-layer path that
dataset-bound dashboard widgets and the dataset preview use, so the numbers and
the server-resolved dimension labels match everywhere. Totals (row subtotals,
column subtotals, grand total) are **server-computed**: the renderer places the
pre-aggregated rows it is handed and never re-aggregates bucketed values
client-side, since measures like `avg` cannot be recombined without drifting
from the semantic layer.

Drill-down is a **host callback, not a registered handler**: pass `onDrill` and
every aggregated row / matrix cell becomes clickable. The report emits *what was
clicked*; the host decides where that goes, because the renderer only knows
dimension names (ADR-0021 D2).

```tsx
import { ReportRenderer, type DatasetDrillArgs } from '@object-ui/plugin-report';
import type { DataSource, SpecReport } from '@object-ui/types';

// `report`, `dataSource` and `router` are host-provided.
declare const report: SpecReport;
declare const dataSource: DataSource;
declare const router: { push: (href: string) => void };

<ReportRenderer
  schema={report}
  dataSource={dataSource}
  onDrill={(args: DatasetDrillArgs) => {
    // The host resolves dataset → object and dimension → field, then navigates.
    const filter = { ...args.objectFilter, ...args.runtimeFilter };
    router.push(`/records/${args.object}?filter=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(filter))}`);
  }}
/>
```

What a drill click carries:

| `DatasetDrillArgs` | Meaning |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| `dataset`      | Dataset the clicked aggregate was computed over. |
| `groupKey`     | Dimension **name** → clicked bucket value (row dims, plus across dims for a matrix cell). |
| `runtimeFilter`| The effective render-time scope filter, if any. |
| `object`       | The dataset's base object, when the server supplied it. |
| `objectFilter` | Exact record-list filter (object **field** name → raw stored value) for the clicked bucket. Present only when the server returned the dimension→field mapping plus raw grouped values — that is what lets select/lookup dimensions filter precisely instead of by display label. |

Supply no `onDrill` and nothing is clickable; a report can also opt out with
`drilldown: false`.

## Filter-time date helpers — current limitation

The server does **not** currently evaluate `` cel`...` `` expressions
embedded in filter values. Use module-load ISO strings instead:

```ts
import { defineReport } from '@objectstack/spec/ui';

const daysAgo = (n: number): string => {
  const d = new Date();
  d.setUTCDate(d.getUTCDate() - n);
  return d.toISOString().slice(0, 10);
};

defineReport({
  name: 'recent_pipeline',
  label: 'Recent Pipeline',
  type: 'summary',
  dataset: 'opportunity_pipeline',
  rows: ['stage'],
  values: ['amount_sum'],
  runtimeFilter: { close_date: { $gte: daysAgo(30) } },
});
```

See the bundled CRM `customer_churn_signals` demo for the full pattern.
Native filter-time CEL evaluation is tracked for a future major version.

## Stored pre-9.0 documents — migration only

> ⚠️ **This section is about documents that already exist in storage. The shape
> it describes is NOT available for authoring** — everything above is how a
> report is written, nothing here is.

Before the ADR-0021 cutover a report carried its own query: an `objectName`,
`columns` as column *definition objects* with `aggregate`, and
`groupingsDown` / `groupingsAcross` with `sortOrder` and `dateGranularity`.
That form is **rejected by the current schema** — `objectName` and
`groupingsDown` come back as unrecognized keys, and object-shaped `columns`
fails as the wrong type (`columns` is now a list of dimension names).

Stored documents in that shape still render, through a deliberately lossy
bridge: `ReportRenderer` converts them to a presentation report and hands that
to `ReportViewer`. The converter reads the *current* keys (`values`, `rows`), so
a pre-9.0 document arrives with none of them and what comes out is the report's
title over an **empty column set**. The document renders; its columns,
groupings, aggregates and sort do not, and nothing reports an error. That is why
the bridge is a waiting room rather than a supported way to write a report.

Migrating one is a re-expression against the dataset:

| Pre-9.0 key                        | Where it goes now                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `objectName`                       | Gone from the report — the `dataset` owns the object.                    |
| `columns: [{ field, aggregate }]`  | `values: string[]`; the aggregate becomes a **measure** in the dataset.  |
| `columns: [{ field }]`             | `rows: string[]`, as a dimension.                                        |
| `groupingsDown: [{ field }]`       | `rows: string[]`.                                                        |
| `groupingsAcross: [{ field }]`     | `columns: string[]`.                                                     |
| `sortOrder` on a grouping          | `order: [{ by, direction }]` on the report.                              |
| `dateGranularity` on a grouping    | A time dimension declared at that grain **in the dataset**.              |
| `filter`                           | `runtimeFilter`.                                                         |

The part with no mechanical equivalent is the dataset itself: measures and time
dimensions the old report declared inline must exist in the semantic layer
before the migrated report can name them.

The query-form renderers that used to draw these documents inline
(`SpecReportGrid`, `MatrixRenderer`, `JoinedReportRenderer`) were removed at the
cutover and have no replacement export — the bridge above is what renders a
stored old-shape document now.

## Legacy presentation layer

`ReportViewer`, `LegacyReportRenderer` and the export functions below remain
available for pre-spec presentation reports (`{ report, data, columns, chart }`)
and are not affected by the dataset-bound pipeline above.

The authoring components that used to sit alongside them — `ReportBuilder`,
`ScheduleConfig`, `ChartConfig`, the columns/groupings editors — and the
`registerDrillHandler`-style drill helpers were **removed** in the 9.0 cutover
(see `CHANGELOG.md`). They have no replacement export in this package: report
authoring lives in the console designer, and drill-down is the `onDrill`
callback above.

### Export

Every format exporter takes the **report schema first and the rows second** —
`(report: ReportComponentSchema, data: any[], config?: ReportExportConfig)`. The
schema is where the exporter reads the columns (`report.fields`) and the download
name (`config.filename`, else `report.title`) from; there is **no filename
parameter**. All five return `void` synchronously — they trigger a browser
download — so there is nothing to `await`:

```tsx
import {
  exportReport,
  exportAsCSV,
  exportAsJSON,
  exportAsHTML,
  exportAsPDF,
  exportAsExcel,
} from '@object-ui/plugin-report';
import type { ReportComponentSchema } from '@object-ui/types';

const report: ReportComponentSchema = {
  type: 'report',
  title: 'Sales Report',
  fields: [
    { name: 'account', label: 'Account' },
    { name: 'amount', label: 'Amount', type: 'currency', aggregation: 'sum' },
  ],
};
const rows = [{ account: 'Acme', amount: 12000 }];

exportAsCSV(report, rows); // downloads "Sales Report.csv"
exportAsJSON(report, rows); // "Sales Report.json"
exportAsHTML(report, rows); // "Sales Report.html"
exportAsPDF(report, rows); // opens a print window; falls back to .html if blocked
exportAsExcel(report, rows, { format: 'excel', filename: 'sales-2026-q1.tsv' });

// `exportReport` is the router — the format comes FIRST, then the same triple.
exportReport('csv', report, rows);
```

`exportAsExcel` writes a BOM-prefixed **TSV** that Excel opens, so its default
name is `report.title` + `.tsv`, not `.xlsx`. `config.includeHeaders: false` drops the
header row; `orientation` / `pageSize` apply to the HTML and PDF paths only.

### Live Export

`exportWithLiveData` fetches the rows itself, so `dataSource` and `resource` are
**required** in `LiveExportOptions` — an options object carrying only `format`
does not compile. It is the one `async` export function, resolving to a
`LiveExportResult`:

```tsx
import { exportWithLiveData } from '@object-ui/plugin-report';
import type { DataSource, ReportComponentSchema } from '@object-ui/types';

// `myAdapter` is a host-provided DataSource (see @object-ui/data-*).
declare const myAdapter: DataSource;
declare const report: ReportComponentSchema;

const result = await exportWithLiveData(report, {
  dataSource: myAdapter,
  resource: 'orders',
  format: 'pdf',
});
// -> { success: true, recordCount: 42, format: 'pdf' }
```

The format falls back to `report.defaultExportFormat`, then `'pdf'`. Failures are
returned, not thrown: `{ success: false, recordCount: 0, format, error }`.

`exportExcelWithFormulas` is a separate, synchronous three-parameter function —
`(report, data, options)` — with the column list inside the third argument. A
column is `{ name, header, width?, numberFormat?, formula? }`: `name` is the key
read off each row (there is no `field` key), `header` is required, and a `formula`
is a template in which the `{ROW}` placeholder is replaced by that row's
spreadsheet line number:

```tsx
import { exportExcelWithFormulas } from '@object-ui/plugin-report';
import type { ReportComponentSchema } from '@object-ui/types';

declare const report: ReportComponentSchema;
declare const rows: Array<Record<string, unknown>>;

exportExcelWithFormulas(report, rows, {
  columns: [
    { name: 'amount', header: 'Amount', numberFormat: '#,##0.00' },
    { name: 'total', header: 'Total', formula: '=B{ROW}*C{ROW}' },
  ],
  includeAggregationRow: true,
  locale: 'de-DE',
});
```

Omitting `columns` derives them from `report.fields`. `includeAggregationRow`
appends a totals row built from each field's `aggregation`.

`locale` is the BCP-47 tag the numeric cells are formatted in — above, an
`amount` of `1234.5` writes `1.234,50` rather than `1,234.50`. Pass the tag the
session renders in: `useDisplayLocale()` from `@object-ui/i18n` in React, or
whatever your non-React caller resolved. This function is not a component and a
display locale is a property of the session rather than of the authored report
schema, so its caller is the only place the tag can come from. Omitted, cells
format in `'en'` — the display channel's own last resort, which is neither
`'en-US'` nor the machine's locale (objectui#10020).

### Scheduled export

A schedule is **data on the report schema**, not a component: it is
`ReportComponentSchema.schedule`, typed `ReportScheduleConfig`. Both types live
in `@object-ui/types` and are *not* re-exported here — importing them from this
package is a TS2305.

`createScheduleTrigger` turns that declared schedule into a callable a workflow
engine can invoke. It takes the report, the data source, the resource to query
and a completion callback:

```ts
import { createScheduleTrigger } from '@object-ui/plugin-report';
import type { DataSource, ReportComponentSchema, ReportScheduleConfig } from '@object-ui/types';

// `dataSource` and `notify` are host-provided.
declare const dataSource: DataSource;
declare const notify: (recipients: string[], subject: string | undefined) => void;

const report: ReportComponentSchema = {
  type: 'report',
  title: 'Monthly Sales',
  schedule: {
    enabled: true,
    frequency: 'monthly',
    dayOfMonth: 1,
    time: '07:00',
    formats: ['pdf', 'excel'],
    recipients: ['sales@example.com'],
  },
};

const trigger = createScheduleTrigger(
  report,
  dataSource,
  'orders',
  (exported: ReportComponentSchema, schedule: ReportScheduleConfig) => {
    notify(schedule.recipients ?? [], schedule.subject ?? exported.title);
  },
);

const results = await trigger(); // LiveExportResult[] — one entry per scheduled format
```

`trigger()` reads `report.schedule` itself: a schedule that is missing or
`enabled: false` exports nothing and resolves to `[]`. Otherwise it exports once
per entry in `schedule.formats` (falling back to `report.defaultExportFormat`,
then `'pdf'`) and calls the completion callback with the report and the schedule
it ran.

### Schema-Driven Usage

Importing the package registers three component types with `ComponentRegistry`:

| `type`          | Component        | Notes                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `report`        | `ReportRenderer` | The dispatcher.                                    |
| `spec-report`   | `ReportRenderer` | Spec-native alias; the report goes under `report`.  |
| `report-viewer` | `ReportViewer`   | Presentation-layer viewer.                         |

```json
{
  "type": "spec-report",
  "report": {
    "name": "opp_by_stage",
    "type": "summary",
    "dataset": "opportunity_pipeline",
    "rows": ["stage"],
    "values": ["amount_sum"]
  }
}
```

There is no `report-builder` component type — the authoring component that name
addressed was removed in the 9.0 cutover, so a node declaring it resolves to
nothing.

### Type-aware cell rendering

`ReportViewer` delegates cell rendering to the shared `getCellRenderer`
registry from `@object-ui/fields`, so each column is rendered with the
component appropriate for its type — instead of `String(value)`.

| `field.type`                  | Rendering                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `text` / `string`             | Plain text                                    |
| `number` / `currency` / `percent` | Locale-formatted, optional currency/percent symbol |
| `boolean`                     | ✓ / ✗ icons                                   |
| `date` / `datetime` / `time`  | Localised date/time                           |
| `select` / `multi_select` / `status` | Badge(s), label resolved from `options`, color from `option.color` or `colorMap` |
| `lookup` / `reference` / `master_detail` | Linked record name (id fallback), deep-link to `/console/apps/<app>/<referenceTo>/record/<id>` |
| `email`                       | `mailto:` link                                |
| `url`                         | External link (`target="_blank"`)             |
| `phone`                       | `tel:` link                                   |
| `image`                       | Inline thumbnail                              |
| `file`                        | Filename + download link                      |
| `user` / `owner`              | Avatar + name                                 |
| `richtext` / `html` / `markdown` | Sanitised inline content                   |
| `json`                        | Collapsed code preview                        |

These are presentation-layer columns: each entry in `report.fields` carries its
own `name`, `label` and `type`, and that declared `type` is what selects the
renderer. This package resolves nothing from object metadata — there is no
`objectName` on a report to hydrate from, and a column with no `type` renders
as plain text.

Legacy `renderAs: 'badge'` + `colorMap` is still honoured for plain
string columns.
