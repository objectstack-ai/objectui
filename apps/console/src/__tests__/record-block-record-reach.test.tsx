 *
 * `record:*` blocks — the BOUND RECORD must reach the output
 * (objectui#3149 layer 3a; objectstack#4413's original shape, stated
 * behaviourally).
 *
 * ## Why a second probe rather than an extension of the first
 *
 * `public-block-binding-reach.test.tsx` asks one question: a block that
 * declares `objectName`, mounted bare — does any data call carry that name?
 * Every `record:*` block is outside that question by construction. They take
 * their subject from `<RecordContextProvider>`, not from a schema prop, so
 * mounted bare they correctly do nothing, and "made no data call" says nothing
 * about whether they work.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical gap. It is the exact place objectstack#4413 lived:
 * `record:details` / `record:highlights` / `record:path` / `record:related_list`
 * published `objectName` + `recordId` that no renderer read, four blocks
 * rendered blank on a real record page, and every gate stayed green — because
 * the framework check compares two declarations (objectstack#4472) and the
 * binding-reach probe cannot see this family at all. Until this file, the claim
 * "this family works under a record page" was an ASSUMPTION with no behavioural
 * evidence behind it.
 *
 * ## The question this asks
 *
 *   Mount the block under a record context with record A, then with record B —
 *   two different records of the SAME object, identical trees. Does anything
 *   about its behaviour change?
 *
 * Evidence is a difference between the two mounts: in the rendered DOM, or in
 * the data calls made. Either one proves the bound record reached the renderer
 * and came out the other side.
 *
 * Two records rather than bound-vs-unbound, deliberately. An unbound control
 * differs in TREE SHAPE (one less provider), so `React.useId` values shift and
 * blocks "differ" for a reason that has nothing to do with the record — the
 * probe would manufacture its own green. Two records under an identical tree
 * hold everything constant except the one variable under test.
 *
 * And a differential rather than "renders something": objectui#3149 records the
 * decision NOT to cover the display primitives precisely because "renders
 * non-empty" is also true of a block that ignores every input it declares. A
 * gate that reports green without checking anything is what objectstack#4472
 * exists to eliminate, and adding one here would be self-defeating. A block
 * that renders the same fixed shell for two different records scores zero
 * evidence — the correct reading of a block whose subject never arrives.
 *
 * The differential is itself checked, not assumed: {@link mountThrice} also
 * renders record A a second time and asserts that mount is byte-identical to
 * the first. If that control ever fails, "A differs from B" stops meaning
 * "the record reached the output" and this whole file's green becomes noise —
 * so it is asserted per block rather than trusted.
 *
 * ## Scope, stated so this is not over-read in turn
 *
 * A difference proves the record REACHES the output. It does not prove the
 * output is RIGHT — nothing on this chain looks at rendered results (ADR-0082
 * addendum). And "no difference" has legitimate causes: a block whose data is
 * injected by the page host rather than declared by the author. Those are
 * ledgered below with the host path NAMED and a file:line to check it against,
 * because "host-fed" is only a reason while a host actually feeds it — the day
 * no host does, "host-fed" is the same excuse objectstack#4413 shipped behind.
 * One entry in the ledger was exactly that case when this file landed:
 * `record:activity`, whose feed no host fed and whose renderer hard-coded
 * `items={[]}`. objectui#3165 gave it a scoped `sys_activity` read and the
 * entry went with it — the ledger's two-way assertion is what forced that.

 * making the block short-circuit. Every value points at something that exists
 * in {@link RECORD_A} / {@link PROBE_OBJECT_SCHEMA}, so a block that reads its
 * config and then reads the record finds real referents on both sides.
 *
 * `sections` is here because the generic `array` sample (`['name']`) is not
 * merely uninformative, it is malformed: `record:details` spreads each section
 * entry, so a bare string became `{0:'n',1:'a',…}` and the block died inside
 * `DetailView` with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')".
 * That crash is the fourth instance of the one lesson this pair of probes keeps
 * re-learning: a plausible value for every input is not a plausible
 * CONFIGURATION. It is also why {@link assertRendered} exists — a crash must
 * fail loudly rather than land in the "no difference" bucket and read as a
 * finding about the block.
 *
 * `add` is the FIFTH instance, and arrived the moment `record:related_list`
 * started publishing it (objectui#3808). The generic `object` sample is `{}`,
 * and `{}` is not a valid `add`: the spec makes `picker` required, so the sample
 * has to carry `picker.object` or the fixture is exercising metadata no author
 * could publish. Filled here rather than by loosening the generic `object`
 * sample, which would put an unspecified bag on every future `object` input.
 *
 * That `{}` did not merely under-exercise the block, it CRASHED it —
 * `RelatedList.tsx:1299` dereferenced `add.picker.object` where `:378` / `:390`
 * optional-chain the same path — and the crash was filed as objectui#3838 rather
 * than papered over here: this fixture's job is to be spec-valid, not to steer
 * clear of the renderer's unguarded reads. #3838 has since tightened that gate
 * to require the resolved `add.picker.object`, so the same `{}` now withholds
 * the Add affordance behind a named console hint instead of taking the block
 * down; the sample below stays spec-valid on its own merit, not as crash
 * avoidance.
