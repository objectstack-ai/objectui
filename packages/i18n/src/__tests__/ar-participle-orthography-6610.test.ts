/**
 * objectui#6610 — the `ar` pack wrote the منقوص active participle of جرى two
 * ways at once: `جارٍ` on 92 values and `جاري` on 8.
 *
 * They are **one word in two spellings**, differing by a single code point at
 * the end of the first word — U+064D (tanwīn kasr, the yāʾ dropped) against
 * U+064A (the yāʾ retained) — not two translations. It is same-screen visible:
 * `app-shell`'s `LoadingScreen.tsx` renders `console.initializing` as the
 * heading over the three `console.loadingSteps.*` as a list and
 * `console.actions.retrying` on the retry button — four values that all said
 * `جاري` — while the console around them had already said `جارٍ` on
 * `dashboard.loading`, `list.loading`, `detail.loadingAttachments` and
 * `console.ai.*`.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Why the 92:8 majority is NOT the argument
 *
 * A distribution cannot rule orthography, and this participle's ending is
 * genuinely **not invariant across syntactic positions** — an اسم منقوص
 * declines three ways:
 *
 *   - indefinite, nominative or genitive → the yāʾ **drops**, the rāʾ takes
 *     tanwīn kasr: `جارٍ`;
 *   - indefinite, **accusative** → the yāʾ is **kept**, with tanwīn fatḥ:
 *     `جاريًا`;
 *   - **definite** (with ال) or **annexed** (as a مضاف) → the yāʾ is **kept**:
 *     `الجاري` / `الجارية`.
 *
 * So "the 8 are correct in their own context" was a live possibility and had to
 * be falsified rather than out-voted. Four measurements did it, and the pins
 * below are what keeps each of them from rotting:
 *
 * 1. **The pack already distinguishes the positions, correctly.** Values that
 *    keep the yāʾ are in positions that require it —
 *    `console.ai.connectionStalled` is the khabar of لا يزال, hence accusative,
 *    hence `جاريًا`; `marketplace.installedAdditiveNote` is attributive on a
 *    definite noun, hence `الجارية`. A pack that were simply yāʾ-blind could not
 *    have got these right, so `جارٍ` elsewhere is a position-sensitive choice,
 *    not a house tic. They are pinned by name below so a later sweep cannot
 *    "normalise" them too.
 *
 *    ⚠️ There were THREE. `empty.appNotAvailableDescription` was the khabar of
 *    ما زال (`جارياً`, the tanwīn written on the alef) — and objectui#9262
 *    retired the clause it sat in, because that clause asserted a publish this
 *    screen had never measured. The row went with the sentence, not with the
 *    rule: nothing about the orthography changed, and a value that reintroduces
 *    an accusative participle belongs back in `YA_IS_CORRECT` with its reason.
 *    ⛔ Do NOT "restore" it by editing the `ar` value — the English it
 *    translates no longer says it.
 *
 * 2. **None of the 8 was in such a position.** All eight opened their string —
 *    nothing governed them into the accusative — none carried ال, and in none
 *    was the participle the مضاف: the maṣdar after it is the delayed subject
 *    (مبتدأ مؤخر) of a fronted indefinite predicate (خبر مقدم), which is
 *    nominative and indefinite. The annexed reading would turn a status message
 *    into a bare noun phrase with no predication, which is not what the `en`
 *    says (`Refreshing…`, `Loading grid…`, `Connecting to data source`).
 *
 * 3. **The minimal pairs settle it.** Both syntactic frames — participle +
 *    definite noun, and participle + indefinite maṣdar heading an iḍāfa —
 *    occurred on **both** sides of the split, five of them with a word-for-word
 *    identical continuation. `grid.refreshing` was `جاري التحديث…` while
 *    `list.refreshing` was `جارٍ التحديث…`: the same two words, one code point
 *    apart. Two spellings of one phrase cannot both be contextually correct.
 *    That pair is pinned below as the evidence it is.
 *
 * 4. **The 92 needed nothing.** None of them followed an accusative governor
 *    (كان / ما زال / لا يزال / إن …); the detector that says so is the same one
 *    that *did* flag all three yāʾ-keeping values in (1), so its zero is a
 *    measurement rather than a silence.
 *
 * ⇒ The 8 were the errors. They were converged onto `جارٍ`, taking the pack to
 * 100:0.
 *
 * ## Why this is a NEW block and not an extension of objectui#5972's
 *
 * #5972 pinned per-language uniformity across the merged `Loading…` group, and
 * it converged the two `ar` members of that group (`common.loading`,
 * `detail.loading`) onto `جارٍ`. The obvious-looking move — widen that gate to
 * cover these 8 — **cannot be made**, and the reason is structural rather than
 * stylistic: that gate *derives* its population from `en`
 * (`value === 'Loading…'`) and asserts the derived set is exactly the ten keys
 * it names. None of these 8 has that `en` value (`Loading grid…`, `Refreshing…`,
 * `Loading chart…`, `Initializing application…`, `Connecting to data source`,
 * `Loading configuration`, `Preparing workspace`, `Retrying…`), so adding them
 * to `LOADING_GROUP` would break the derivation check that is that gate's own
 * anti-vacuity guard. The orthography split simply does not respect an
 * `en`-value boundary — it is a property of one pack's spelling, not of a group
 * of shared strings.
 *
 * So this is the move `de-quote-pairing-3876.test.ts` made instead: a per-key
 * list becomes a **pack-wide invariant** ("no U+0022 anywhere in `de`" there;
 * "no bare `جاري` anywhere in `ar`" here). It needs no per-key maintenance — a
 * ninth value arriving with the yāʾ fails by key name without anyone editing
 * this file, which is the whole point, since the edit alone would have left the
 * ninth to be written tomorrow.
 *
 * ## Why the three script gates cannot see any of this
 *
 * `all-locales-key-parity` compares key sets and placeholder shapes,
 * `check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` asks only whether a key resolves, and
 * `check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` fires on an **`en` value change** — the `en` side of
 * all eight is untouched and always has been, so no drift event ever existed.
 * Value-level orthography in a non-Latin pack is invisible to all three, which
 * is why the invariant has to live in a test.
 *
 * ## What this file deliberately does NOT rule on
 *
 * **Gender agreement.** Nine values put the masculine participle before a
 * feminine maṣdar (`إعادة`, `إضافة`, `تهيئة`, `الموافقة`, `المعالجة`); strict
 * agreement would want `جارية`. The impersonal frozen `جارٍ` is standard MSA UI
 * register, and — load-bearing here — the pack applied it **uniformly on both
 * sides of this split**, so it was never a distinguishing factor between the 8
 * and the 92 and it is not a same-screen inconsistency. Ruling it needs an
 * Arabic desk; this file's green is not a claim about it.
 *
 * **The other nine packs.** This is an `ar` spelling rule. No key set and no
 * placeholder shape moved, so nothing here reaches them.
