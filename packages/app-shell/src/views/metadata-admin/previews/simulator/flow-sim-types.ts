/**
 * Shared types for the designer-time flow simulator.
 *
 * The simulator is a CLIENT-SIDE, BACKEND-FREE interpreter used to debug a flow
 * draft inside the visual designer. It NEVER calls a `dataSource`: every
 * side-effecting node (CRUD / connector / http / script) is MOCKED, so running
 * a simulation can never write or delete real data and never needs a live
 * environment. Its guiding rule (per design review) is: *never silently
 * simulate semantics that differ from the runtime* — anything we cannot
 * faithfully model (join synchronization, subflows, boundary events, arbitrary
 * script code) is surfaced as an explicit pause/notice instead of a fake
 * "success".

   * Imported from the spec rather than restated. The local spelling used to be
   * `string | { source?: string }`, and a restatement gets it wrong in BOTH

   * envelope that `FlowEdgeSchema` rejects outright; too NARROW, because
   * excess-property checking then refuses the canonical envelope written as a
   * literal (`dialect` "does not exist" on `{ source?: string }`). Correcting
   * it by hand only moves the drift — the next spelling omits `ast` or `meta`.
   * objectui#3202 removed the same restatement from `FlowDesignerEdge`; this
   * was its last copy, and the reason the simulator could not read a guard the
