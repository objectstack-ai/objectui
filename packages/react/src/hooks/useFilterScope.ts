 * The session values filter placeholders resolve against — `{current_user_id}`
 * and `{current_org_id}` (objectstack-ai/objectstack#3574).
 *
 * ## Why a dedicated context
 *
 * The renderer packages (`plugin-dashboard`, `plugin-charts`, `plugin-list`)
 * deliberately do not depend on `@object-ui/auth`; they receive everything
 * they need as schema or context. But a widget cannot resolve
 * `{current_user_id}` without knowing who is signed in, and the surfaces that
 * DO know (the app-shell) sit above them.
 *
 * `PredicateScopeContext` already carries `current_user` and would have
 * covered the user id, but it is the *expression* evaluation scope — it
 * carries no organization, and widening it for an unrelated consumer would
 * couple filter resolution to predicate semantics. A separate, two-field
 * context keeps the contract explicit and lets a non-console host provide
 * exactly these values without adopting the expression stack.
 *
 * When no provider is mounted this returns an empty scope. That is a safe
 * default: unresolved tokens are left intact by the resolver, so the filter
 * matches nothing rather than silently widening, and the resolver emits one
 * warning naming the token.
 */

 * Provide the session scope used to resolve filter placeholders.

 * mounts it next to `ExpressionProvider`, where both the signed-in user and
