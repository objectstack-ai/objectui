/**
 * `objectui check`'s validity arm and the three-bucket report (objectui#6075).
 *
 * The structural marker (objectui#5127) bought precision with recall: a leaf
 * schema that carries only its own vocabulary — `{ "type": "statistic",
 * "label": …, "value": … }`, the majority shape of the real corpus — has no
 * `children`, no `className` and no `body`, so nothing validated it. The
 * maintainer's 2026-08-25 ruling on objectui#5392 (Option B, no shipped schema
 * artifact) selected `safeValidateSchema` as the second recogniser arm.
 *
 * ## What this file exists to stop
 *
 * A recogniser built on validation answers ONE question ("does this document
 * parse as an ObjectUI component?") with TWO meanings: "not ours" and "ours,
 * and broken". Collapsing them files every broken ObjectUI schema as a foreign
 * file — and the symptom of that bug is an ABSENCE. The file stops being
 * mentioned; no count moves in a direction anyone would question; nothing
 * prompts a re-read. It is precisely the defect `check` exists to catch,
 * hidden by the mechanism meant to catch it.
 *
 * So the command reports three buckets, and half of the tests below are
 * negative: they fail if a future simplification back to two buckets swallows
 * the broken-schema case. A suite that only proved the newly-recognised files
 * are judged would pass that simplification without a murmur.
 *
 * Fixtures live under `os.tmpdir()`, never in the repo tree: `check()` globs
 * every JSON file under the directory it is handed, so a fixture committed
 * inside this workspace would be scanned by every other run of the command,
 * the repo's own `pnpm check` included.

    // and `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` — and `AnyComponentSchema` is a union of
    // COMPONENT schemas that has no member for it. So the well-formed document
    // below fails the validity arm. Reporting it is right (a registered type the
    // shipped validator cannot validate is itself a finding) but calling it
    // INVALID would overclaim: nothing about this document is wrong.
    //
    // ## Pick this type by measurement, not memory (objectui#6939)

    // Re-measured on this tree (objectui#8499): `KNOWN_SCHEMA_TYPES` carries 656
    // registered types and `AnyComponentSchema` declares 154 distinct literal
    // `type` values, so 505 registered types have no member. The probe was
    // controlled in both directions — `kanban`, `text` and `tree-view` all read
    // as MODELLED (so it is not blind to real members) and a nonsense type reads
    // as unmodelled.
    //
    // ## Why it is no longer `abbr`
    //
    // This sample was `abbr` on the reasoning that "the raw HTML primitives are
    // the stable inhabitants of this bucket". They were not: objectui#8499 armed
    // the whole registered HTML passthrough set (`h1`…`h6`, `p`, `a`, `abbr`, …)
    // together with the seven semantic sectioning tags, precisely because a
    // registered renderer the validator cannot name is a defect rather than a
    // stable state of affairs. The 47 literals that card added are what took 102
    // to 154 above, and they took this fixture with them.
    //
    // The replacement is chosen for a stronger property than "nobody has got to
    // it yet": `metric-card`'s absence from this union is RULED. It is objectui's
    // CLOSED dashboard-widget-slot extension, admitted by the 2026-08-14 ruling
    // (objectstack#8593), and `packages/types/src/zod/complex.zod.ts` records in
    // as many words that it is "DELIBERATELY not an arm of `AnyComponentSchema`".
    // So this fixture cannot rot the way `abbr` did without a maintainer
    // reversing that ruling — which is exactly when this test SHOULD be re-read.
    //
    // ## Why it is no longer `kanban`
    //
    // This sample used to be a kanban board authoring `cards`, and the comment
    // here claimed `AnyComponentSchema` "has no member for" kanban. That claim
    // was FALSE, and was false before objectui#6939 touched anything —
    // `ComplexSchema` has carried `KanbanSchema` throughout. The real mechanism
    // was a required-key mismatch: `KanbanColumnSchema` demanded `items` while
    // every board, and this sample, writes `cards`. objectui#6939 repaired that

    // bare `expected +0 to be 1`. If this fires: the objectstack#8593 ruling has
