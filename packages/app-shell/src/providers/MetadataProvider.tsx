 * already correct synchronously at mount, and it is the SAME credential the
 * request that filled the cache authenticated with — so, exactly as with the
 * tenant scope, the key cannot claim a principal the server did not filter for.
 *

/**
 * Merge `view` metadata into object definitions so that `objectDef.listViews`
 * is populated for the renderer (`@object-ui/plugin-view`) which expects it.
 *
 * Two view shapes coexist in the `view` metadata type — **both deliberate, and
 * neither one a leftover** (objectstack#4959 settled this end-to-end; see
 * framework `objectql/engine.ts` registration). Each belongs to a different
 * authoring gate, so this merge has to read both:
 *
 *  1. Independent **ViewItem** — the RECORD gate (ADR-0017, "Object has-many
 *     View"): one first-class metadata record per named view, as authored by
 *     `defineViewItem` or written through the runtime `/meta` seam.
 *       { name: '<object>.<key>', object, viewKind: 'list' | 'form',
 *         label, isDefault?, config: { type, data, columns, … } }
 *     `viewKind` is the family discriminant and the view body lives under
 *     `config`. We route `viewKind: 'list'` items into `listViews` and
 *     `viewKind: 'form'` items into `formViews` — so FORM-family views never
 *     surface in the list-view switcher (which only reads `listViews`).
 *
 *  2. Aggregated **container** `{ list?, form?, listViews?, formViews? }` keyed
 *     by the bare object name — the STACK gate's packaging shape: what
 *     `defineView` emits and what a stack carries in
 *     `defineStack({ views: [...] })`. The spec treats it as first class
 *     (`isAggregatedViewContainer` / `expandViewContainer` in
 *     `@objectstack/spec/ui`), so it is NOT legacy and this branch is NOT dead
 *     code — delete it and stack-packaged views stop reaching the renderer.
 *     A container is served UNEXPANDED on purpose (the platform's write
 *     chokepoint states it: "container bodies are left untouched —
 *     `expandViewContainer` derives identity itself"), so this branch asks the
 *     composer for each view's identity rather than deriving one of its own
 *     (objectui#3770). Both gates therefore produce the same canonical
 *     `<object>.<key>` ids — including the default `list`'s implicit
 *     `<object>.default` — and the container inherits the composer's folding and
 *     collision-renaming rules for free.
 *     When an object already has expanded ViewItems the container is skipped for
 *     THAT object: it restates the same identities, and the ViewItem rows are
 *     the authoritative ones (the runtime heals personalization overlays onto
 *     them).
 *
 * Existing `obj.listViews` / `obj.list_views` win to preserve overrides.

 * (The third, the aggregated container, is not bound and never reaches here.)

 * This used to be a `{}` fallback, so the overlay's branch read a `config` it

 * top-level `columns` / `type` / `data` the author wrote was dropped, with no
 * diagnostic, while the tab still rendered (binding is by `object` +
 * `viewKind`, which is why nothing looked broken from the outside).

 * new dialect: the sibling read paths already ask it this way — `listViews` in
 * `@object-ui/data-objectstack` unwraps a nested `config` and returns a flat
