/**
 * objectui#7365 — a gantt BAR is declared an OBJECT on both faces (director
 * seat, decision batch #71, 2026-09-07; maintainer reply verbatim
 * 「其他同意」, option B).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * objectui#7164 narrowed the ROW (`items: [null]` is refused) and stopped
 * there DELIBERATELY, recording the stop in both faces' docblocks: the BARS
 * inside a row stayed `z.array(z.any())`. So an authored `null` BAR —
 * `{ items: [{ label: 'R', items: [null] }] }` — was green through `validate`
 * and only met the render-time date diagnostic, which named it
 *
 *     items[0].items[0].startDate is undefined, which is not a valid date
 *
 * — the WRONG FAULT, by a key the author never wrote. That is the same
 * mis-naming class objectui#7164 repaired for rows, one level down. The
 * ruling: a bar that is not a bar is refused at `validate`, by its own name.
 * objectui#7164's deliberate stop is superseded KNOWINGLY.
 *
 * ## The accept set, before and after (measured on `289d146` + this change; re-measured unchanged on `c4b3750`)
 *
 *     input                                             main     head
 *     items: [{ items: [null] }]                        accept   REFUSE  items[0].items[0]
 *     items: [{ items: [0] }]                           accept   REFUSE  items[0].items[0]
 *     items: [{ items: ['x'] }]                         accept   REFUSE  items[0].items[0]
 *     items: [{ items: [true] }]                        accept   REFUSE  items[0].items[0]
 *     items: [{ items: [[]] }]                          accept   REFUSE  items[0].items[0]
 *     items: [{ items: [undefined] }]                   accept   REFUSE  items[0].items[0]
 *     items: [{ items: [GOOD, null] }]                  accept   REFUSE  items[0].items[1]
 *     items: [{ items: [GOOD] }, { items: [null] }]     accept   REFUSE  items[1].items[0]
 *     items: [{ items: [GOOD] }]                        accept   accept
 *     items: [{ items: [{}] }]                          accept   accept   (keys stay open)
 *     items: [{ items: [] }]                            accept   accept
 *     items: [{ label: 'R' }]                           accept   accept
 *     a feed-variant items array                        accept   accept
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT narrowed
 *
 * The bar stays `.passthrough()`: its own keys (`title` / `startDate` /
 * `endDate` / `variant?`) are read dynamically by the renderer and are NOT
 * declared, so `items: [{}]` still parses — this card refuses a bar that is
 * not a bar, not a bar with the wrong keys. ⛔ Option A is REFUSED, not
 * deferred: `timeline.gantt.unusableRange.malformedRow`'s copy is unchanged,
 * no fourth path level was added, and the ten language packs are untouched.
 * The render-time date diagnostic remains the defined outcome for anything
 * that still reaches it, and the renderer stays only ever MORE lenient than
 * `validate` — asserted over the in-repo fixtures at the foot of this file.
 *
 * ⭐ The "NOT declared" clause is SUPERSEDED by objectui#6356 (maintainer
 * ruling 2026-09-27, Q2 = C): the bar now declares its four keys, every one
 * OPTIONAL, and stays `.passthrough()` — so `items: [{}]` still parses, the
 * refusals above keep their `items[i].items[j]` paths and `invalid_type`
 * code, and an undeclared bar key is refused only by the strict authoring
 * face. `./timeline-item-element-6356.test.ts` pins the declared keys.
 *
 * ## Stock measured before the narrowing, positive-controlled
 *
 * A published accept set narrows here (Clause-② yes), so the in-repo stock of
 * authored bars was counted on `289d146`, re-measured unchanged on
 * `c4b3750`, across `apps/` · `examples/` · `content/` ·
 * `packages/types/examples/`: FIVE bars, all well-formed objects,
 * ZERO `null` and ZERO non-object. The zero is a READING and not an empty
 * search — the same walker reported the five well-formed bars, and a planted
 * `null` bar plus a planted numeric bar in a scratch copy of the gantt fixture
 * were both found. `hotcrm` is a separate repository and is not reachable from
 * this checkout; it is unmeasured here and named as such on the PR. The
 * fixture census at the foot of this file is the durable half of that reading.
