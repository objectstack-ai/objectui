/**
 * objectui#7104 — `AlertDialogSchema` declares the keys the `alert-dialog`
 * renderer READS.
 *
 * Measured on `origin/main` `a3eb5d07a`, re-measured unchanged on `6eebc54b6`
 * (2026-09-05, the branch's merge-base at push time): the renderer
 * (`packages/components/src/renderers/overlay/alert-dialog.tsx`) reads
 * `schema.content` (the body, through `renderChildren`), `schema.cancelText`
 * (draws `AlertDialogCancel` only when truthy), `schema.actionText` (draws
 * `AlertDialogAction` only when truthy) and `schema.onAction` (that button's
 * `onClick`) — and NONE of the four was declared on the TS interface or in the
 * zod mirror. They were accepted only because `BaseSchema` carries
 * `[key: string]: any` and the mirror is `.passthrough()`: no editor completed
 * them, no page named them, and a wrong-typed value rode through unexamined.
 * Meanwhile the three keys the type DID declare for the same affordance
 * (`cancelLabel` / `confirmLabel` / `confirmVariant`) are read by nothing, so a
 * document written strictly against the shipped type renders an EMPTY footer.
 *
 * Direction (the PM ruling on the card): declare what the renderer reads. The
 * read dialect is the one live documents are written in — the component's own
 * registered `inputs` and `defaultProps` ship `cancelText` / `actionText`, and
 * the in-repo producer census (lit controls in the PR body) finds three
 * producers of the read dialect on an alert-dialog node and zero of the
 * declared one. Teaching the renderer `cancelLabel` instead would silently
 * blank the footer of every document that works today. ⛔ Neither dialect is
 * declared twice: one affordance, one authoring name (AGENTS.md #0.1).
 *
 * ## Both faces, per key
 *
 * - `content`, `cancelText`, `actionText` — declared on BOTH faces with the
 *   value domain the read enforces: `renderChildren` takes a node or a node
 *   array (the sibling overlays' `content` shape), and the two labels are
 *   truthiness-gated strings with NO renderer default (omit one and that
 *   button is not drawn; the designer palette seeds `'Cancel'` / `'Continue'`).
 * - `onAction` — a RUNTIME SLOT in the objectui#6124 shape: callable on the TS
 *   face (the renderer wires it as the action button's `onClick`), refused BY
 *   NAME in the mirror through `handlerKeyRefusal()` because JSON has no
 *   function value. It is the live key the `onConfirm` tombstone points at.
 *
 * ## Red first
 *
 * Written and run BEFORE the schema edit, on the untouched base. Predicted and
 * observed there: the membership legs red (no such mirror members), the
 * wrong-typed-value legs red (the values parsed green through passthrough),
 * the `onAction` legs red, the docs rows red (the page still published the
 * phantom `actions` row); the controls, the renderer scan, the inert-trio pins
 * and the fixture pins green. The compile-time leg failed on every `Equal`
 * over the four new members, which resolved to `any` through the index
 * signature. The PR body carries the counts from that run.
 *
 * ## What this file left OPEN, and what has since closed it
 *
 * - RESOLVED, and re-derived rather than deleted: `cancelLabel` /
 *   `confirmLabel` / `confirmVariant` used to stay declared on both faces and
 *   read by nothing, and the pins below recorded that state so that the PR
 *   retiring them would re-derive these lines deliberately rather than pass
 *   unnoticed. That PR is objectui#7963 (maintainer ruling 2026-09-10, ADR-0049
 *   enforce-or-remove), and this file went red exactly where it was built to:
 *   the three type-level `StillDeclared` legs and the `@default` docblock leg.
 *   The block near the bottom is the SAME pin re-derived onto the other side of
 *   the flip — the trio is now REFUSED BY NAME rather than merely inert, so what
 *   it asserts is that the keys stay DECLARED (which is what makes a refusal
 *   loud under `.passthrough()`), that the renderer still reads none of them,
 *   and that their docblocks now teach the retirement instead of publishing an
 *   `@default` nothing applies. The parse-level and TypeScript-level contract of
 *   that refusal lives in its own file,
 *   `alert-dialog-footer-keys-refusal-7963.test.ts`, and the DOM reading it
 *   rests on lives with the renderer, in
 *   `packages/components/src/__tests__/alert-dialog-footer-keys-liveness-7963.test.tsx`
 *   — deliberately not duplicated here, for the same reason the objectui#7693
 *   half below is not: this package cannot see a renderer.
 * - RESOLVED, and re-derived rather than deleted: the four schema-catalog
 *   fixtures used to author `actions`, a key no surface carries, so the docs
 *   page's own examples rendered an empty footer — objectui#7693. That card
 *   landed and this file went red exactly as predicted above, on all four
 *   membership legs. The block at the bottom is the SAME pin re-derived onto
 *   the other side of the flip: the fixtures now author the read dialect, and
 *   what it asserts is the TYPES-side reading (every key they author is a
 *   member of the mirror's shape), not the render-side one. The render-side
 *   half lives with the catalog, in
 *   `examples/schema-catalog/test/alert-dialog-footer-read-dialect-7693.test.tsx`
 *   — deliberately not duplicated here, because this package cannot see a
 *   renderer and that one cannot see the mirror's shape.
