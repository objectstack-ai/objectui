/**
 * The empty-bucket drill returns the empty bucket's ROWS — objectui#9085.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `buildDatasetDrillFilter` wrote a bare `null` for a bucket whose dimension
 * value is empty. `convertFiltersToAST` SKIPS a key whose value is `null` /
 * `undefined` — its oldest pinned behaviour, pinned by name as "should skip
 * null and undefined values" — so the constraint never reached the wire and the
 * drill answered with a SUPERSET: every row, silently, nothing thrown and
 * nothing logged.
 *
 * The repair is at the PRODUCER. ⛔ The converter is NOT touched: other
 * producers rely on that skip, and objectui#9020 ruled it stays.
 *
 * ## Why these assertions are ROW SETS and not composed-object shapes
 *
 * The defect is invisible in the composed object — `{ owner: null }` looks like
 * a filter. It only becomes wrong one layer down, where the key is dropped. A
 * shape assertion therefore cannot fail for the reason this card exists, so
 * every case below lowers the composed filter through the real sink
 * (`toFilterNode`) and asks a real matcher (`ValueDataSource`) which rows come
 * back.
 *
 * ## The fixture answers the semantic question the spelling had to settle
 *
 * `MISSING` has no `owner` KEY AT ALL; `EXPLICIT_NULL` has `owner: null`. The
 * two are told apart by exactly one thing — which spelling the producer emits:
 *
 *   - `['owner','is_null',true]`  selects BOTH  (what `{ $null: true }` lowers to)
 *   - equality against `null`      selects only EXPLICIT_NULL
 *
 * The aggregate counted both into the one empty bucket, so the drill has to
 * return both, and the third case below is that choice pinned as a row set
 * rather than asserted as a preference.
