/**
 * `useNavRunAction` — the console-side consumer of the DECLARED nav
 * `runAction` slot (`ObjectNavItemSchema.runAction`, objectstack#7253).
 *
 * ## What it consumes
 *
 * `NavigationRenderer.resolveHref` encodes an object nav entry's declared
 * `runAction` as {@link NAV_RUN_ACTION_PARAM} on the list href. When the shell
 * lands on that list, this hook reads the name back through the SAME constant
 * and hands it to the toolbar, which marks the matching action `autoTrigger` so
 * it runs through the ordinary execute path — param dialogs, confirms and
 * entitlement gates all still apply.
 *
 * ## Why this is a hook and not two `window.location` reads (#5216)
 *
 * It replaces a private convention: `EnvironmentListToolbar` used to read a
 * bare `'runAction'` literal off `window.location.search` and compare it to a
 * hard-coded `'create_environment'`, while `CloudOnboardingNext` hand-built the
 * matching query string at the other end. Two literals, no schema, no registry
 * — a second de-facto contract that `objectui validate` could not see and no
 * gate could check. The name now has one definition and the VALUE comes from
 * declared metadata, so the deep link is authored, validated and rendered
 * through one contract.
 *
 * ## Arming is destructive — the #4123 rule, kept
 *
 * Consumption is modelled as "strip the param", so arming SPENDS a one-shot
 * user intent: once stripped, a reload cannot retry it. So the caller passes an
 * `armed` predicate and the hook consumes only when it answers true — i.e. only
 * when there is genuinely something to run. This is also the client's answer to
 * a name no action declares: `defineStack`'s cross-reference walk rejects those
 * at AUTHORING time ("deep-link references action '…' (via runAction)"), and a
 * client that somehow arrives holding one runs nothing AND leaves the URL
 * alone, so a later mount with fresher metadata can still honour it. Degrading
 * quietly is right here precisely because the loud rejection already happened
 * upstream, where the author could act on it.
 *
 * Router-free on purpose (`window.location` + `history.replaceState`): the
 * toolbars that call this also render in tests and hosts without a Router, and
 * the param is a one-shot signal rather than navigation state.

/**
 * The deep-link PREPARATION step for a surface that renders its declared
 * actions through `action:bar` — `useNavRunAction` plus the action's own
 * declared `visible` gate (objectui#4191, ruling A).
 *
 * ## Why the gate is here and not only in the renderer
 *
 * The renderers (`action:button` / `action:menu`, through the shared
 * `useAutoTriggerOnce`) already refuse an `autoTrigger` whose action is hidden
 * by its own `visible`. But by the time a renderer refuses, THIS step has
 * already consumed the one-shot intent — the param is stripped and a reload
 * cannot retry it, the #4123 failure. So the preparation step asks the same
 * question first: a candidate its author hid on this surface is neither marked
 * `autoTrigger` nor consumed, and the refusal is reported here — a notice for
 * the user (the same `actions.notAvailableHere` text the renderers use) and a
 * dev-build diagnostic for the author.
 *
 * ## The SAME predicate the renderer evaluates — composed, not re-implemented
 *
 * `action:button` hides itself when `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate(visible)` and
 * the fail-closed `useCondition(toPredicateInput(visible), recordContext,
 * { throwOnError: true, label })` answers false. This step calls exactly those
 * three exported functions with exactly those inputs: the ambient predicate
 * scope is read by `useCondition` itself from the same tree position the bar
 * renders at, and the record context is `usePredicateRecordContext(undefined)`
 * because a list toolbar has no row — the bar is mounted without `data` there,
 * so the button binds no row either. The `label` is spelled the way
 * `action:button` spells it, so a throwing predicate warns once, not twice.
 * `__tests__/useOfferedNavRunAction.test.tsx` pins the two verdicts against each
 * other through the real `action:bar`.
 *
 * Not an authorization boundary: confirm / param / entitlement / server
 * permission checks apply on every execute path whatever this answers.
 *
 * @param actions   The surface's declared actions (already localized).
 * @param onSurface Does this action render on this surface (placement)?
 * @param enabled   `false` when another consumer owns the param on this page.
 * @returns The requested action name while armed and unconsumed, else `null`.
