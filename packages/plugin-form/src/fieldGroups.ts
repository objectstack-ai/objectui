 * The derivation runs against the RENDERED field list (post permission /

 * The rules, each objectui#9780's (maintainer ruling 2026-09-18, letter A):

 *    intent and `collapsed: true` its most natural spelling, so that spelling
 *    installs the control.
 *  - `collapsible: false` WITH `collapsed: true` is the same contradiction and
 *    resolves the same way — collapsed wins, the control is present.
 *  - The control is read off the DECLARATION, ⛔ never off the live state:
 *    deriving it from the live state would delete the control the moment the
 *    user opened the section.
 *  - A section declaring neither member is untouched.
 *  - ⭐ A section is only ever collapsed when it is collapsible, and it is only
 *    collapsible when it has a divider row to carry the control — which, by
 *    the one row rule (`sectionDrawsDividerRow`), is exactly when it yields a
 *    heading or a blurb. So fields leave the DOM only while a control that
 *    brings them back is on the page.

 *    and reported (`headinglessCollapseWarning`) — letter E item 3.

 * added here is added for every arm at once, and a key dropped here is dropped
 * for every arm at once, which is what makes the loss visible instead of
 * silent.
 *
 * ⭐ AND ONE RULE FOR WHICH ROW (director ruling letter E, maintainer 「同意」).
 * There is no per-arm gate any more — the enumerated four-way union this
 * function used to take as a parameter was deleted by that ruling:
 *
 *  1. 「Group-level semantics are independent of the heading」 — the ADR-0089
 *     `visibleWhen` predicate and the objectui#6236 membership claim ride
 *     EVERY row this function returns, so a headingless group is never
 *     un-gated, and the claim names only the group's own resolved members, so
 *     its predicate never hides more than the group it names.
 *  2. The VISIBLE row exists iff `title || description`
 *     (`sectionDrawsDividerRow`); with `description` only, it is the blurb-only
 *     row — no heading span, just the blurb (objectui#9835's shape).
 *  3. A group with neither, that authored a predicate, still needs a carrier
 *     for item 1: it gets a CHROME-LESS gate row — no `label`, no
 *     `description`, so `SectionDivider` renders nothing — which exists only
 *     to carry the predicate and the claim. It is the same shape `TabbedForm`
 *     already emits for a degraded single-section form, spelled
 *     `__section_gate_` like that one. A group with neither and no predicate
 *     returns no row at all: nothing to draw, nothing to gate.
 *
 * The key set, and who owns each member:
 *
 *  - `label` — the heading. The arm resolves i18n before handing it over.
 *  - `description` — the authored blurb (objectui#9779 / #9834 / #9849).
 *  - `visibleWhen` — ADR-0089's section predicate (#6111). The renderer
 *    evaluates it on this pseudo-field with the host predicate scope bound
 *    (#6010), so copying it here is what makes the authored predicate reach an
 *    evaluator at all.
 *  - `fields` — the objectui#6236 membership claim: RESOLVED member names, so
 *    the predicate gates the whole group and not just the heading.
 *  - `colSpan` — see `DIVIDER_COL_SPAN`.
 *  - `collapsible` / `collapsed` / `onToggle` — on the visible row only (the
 *    control lives on the row), and only when the arm hands over a resolved
 *    `collapse`; see `SectionDividerSource`.
 *  - `className` — emitted only when the arm hands one over. objectstack#13626
 *    ("retire the reads", maintainer ruling 2026-09-01) took this read off
 *    every arm but `ModalForm`'s explicit-sections push, whose residue is
 *    preserved here rather than retired in passing: retiring it is a second
 *    ruling's job, and `sectionStyleKeysRetired-13626` pins the arms that
 *    already dropped it.
 *
 * ⛔ Not read, on any arm: `gridClassName` — a per-section grid needs a
 * per-section form, which the single-form structure these arms share does not
 * have.
