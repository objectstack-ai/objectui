/**
 * ONE discovery of the `createSafeTranslation` defaults tables, shared by every
 * gate that judges their rows — objectui#7884.
 *
 * ## Why this is a shared module and not a second walk
 *
 * Two gates ask different questions of the SAME population:
 *
 *   - `packages/i18n/src/__tests__/fallback-placeholder-spelling-3512.test.ts`
 *     (objectui#3512) — is every placeholder spelled the one way the
 *     provider-less `fallbackT` can resolve?
 *   - `packages/app-shell/src/__tests__/defaults-maps-mirror-en-pack.test.tsx`
 *     (objectui#4401, widened by objectui#7884) — does every row name a key the
 *     `en` pack actually defines?
 *
 * The second one used to read a HAND-WRITTEN list of three imported maps, so it
 * judged 400 of 1056 rows (37.9%) and could not see the five dead
 * `timeline.relative.*` rows of objectui#7874 at all (retired in #7887). The fix is not a second
 * traversal — two traversals are two definitions of the population that drift
 * apart, which is the disease objectui#7448 / #7528 / #7548 / #7825 / #7853 all
 * record. So the walk objectui#3512 already had moved HERE, unchanged, and both
 * gates now discover the same tables from the same code.
 *
 * ## Why an import-based list can never be completed by hand
 *
 * Not a matter of diligence: of the 32 factory call sites on this tree, **11 are
 * anonymous inline object literals** passed straight to `createSafeTranslation(…)`
 * and exported under no name at all. A gate that reaches its tables by
 * `import { X_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS }` is structurally incapable of naming them.
 * Discovery resolves the factory's FIRST ARGUMENT instead, so an inline table is
 * gated the day it is written.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in `@object-ui/test-support`
 *
 * The two callers are in different packages (`@object-ui/i18n` and
 * `@object-ui/app-shell`), and app-shell already depends on i18n — so parking
 * the walk in either one would either invert a dependency or force a deep
 * subpath import into another package's `src/__tests__/`, the shape
 * objectui#4325 ruled out. This package is `private: true`, never published, and
 * exists precisely for modules two suites share.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is reached as a DECLARED subpath — `@object-ui/test-support/defaults-table-scan`
 * — and NOT from the package index, even though that index is otherwise the
 * package's whole surface. A barrel re-export puts this module into the program
 * of every consumer that imports the index for anything at all, and this module
 * only type-checks where Node's ambient types are present. Measured: with it on
 * the index, `data-objectstack` (which imports `{ enumOptions }` from the index
 * in one test) compiled this file and failed the repo-wide type-check with three
 * TS2591s. The index docstring carries the full reasoning.
 *
 * ## `typescript` is loaded lazily, on purpose
 *
 * `require('typescript')` measures 260-375ms on this container, and a barrel that
 * pulled this module in would make ~40 test files wanting a DOM leak judge or a
 * spec reader pay for a compiler they never use. The subpath already keeps them
 * out; this keeps the cost off the two gates' own import phase as well. AGENTS.md
 * §测试纪律 names exactly that shape — an unbounded module load inside a bounded
 * window — as the top cause of flaky tests here (one first `import()` measured
 * at 976ms against RTL's 1000ms default budget). So the compiler is pulled in on
 * the first `scanDefaultsTables()` call and never at import time. The scan
 * itself is memoised per repo root, so the ~1600-file walk happens once per
 * process no matter how many gates ask for it.

 * quietly serving an ungated table.
 *
 * ⚠️ ASSEMBLED FROM FRAGMENTS ON PURPOSE, and it must stay that way. This walk
 * skips `__tests__` directories, which is why objectui#3512 could hold the
 * needle as one literal while living in one. This module does NOT live in a
 * skipped directory, so a verbatim spelling here makes the scanner match its
 * own source and report itself as a fifth interpolator — measured exactly that
 * way during the objectui#7884 move: `packages/test-support/src/defaults-table

/**
 * The tables whose packages re-implemented `fallbackT`'s literal needle rather
 * than taking the factory. Each file states its own reason for that; none of
 * them changes the grammar the needle accepts, so the rule is the same.
 * `TIMELINE_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS` also reaches the factory — listed anyway, so
 * the registry mirrors the needle-file set objectui#3512's completeness case
 * pins. That deliberate double-listing is why a caller must de-duplicate on
 * `where` + `key` before reporting counts: its 21 rows are discovered twice.
 *
 * ## Why the DATA lives in `hand-rolled-tables.json` (objectui#7877)
 *
 * A second reader arrived that is not TypeScript:
 * `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` widened its `createSafeTranslation`
 * value-compare over these tables (objectui#7567 Q2's B half). That gate is a
 * bare `node scripts/check-*.mjs`, so it cannot import this module at all —
 * `exports["./defaults-table-scan"]` resolves to TypeScript SOURCE with no build
 * artefact. The shape here is the one the 2026-08-31 ruling (`d3bf4fa6f`) already set for exactly
 * that wall, and `zod-wrapper-keys.json` is its first instance: the DATA moves
 * to build-free JSON with its own `exports` subpath
 * (`@object-ui/test-support/hand-rolled-tables`), `resolveJsonModule` types it
 * for every TypeScript consumer, `node` reads the same bytes through the
 * subpath, and this module keeps the prose JSON cannot carry.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONE declaration, not two pinned copies. The alternative — a second literal
 * list inside the gate, pinned to this one by a test (the objectui#7310 /
 * PR #8028 shape) — was available and is deliberately not what this is: two
 * lists CAN disagree between the moment one is edited and the moment the pin
 * runs, and the whole point of a registry that gates a scan population is that
 * "0 drifted" must never be readable off a list that quietly lost an entry.
 *
 * ## The staleness ratchet lives in objectui#3512's completeness case
 *
 * A declared list rots when a table is added and not declared. What makes this
 * one complete is not diligence, it is
 * `packages/i18n/src/__tests__/fallback-placeholder-spelling-3512.test.ts`'s
 * "covers the three hand-rolled interpolators, and no fourth exists": it asserts
 * `scan.needle` — every runtime file carrying `NEEDLE_IN_SOURCE` — equals a
 * pinned file list, and that every entry here contributes rows. A fourth
 * hand-rolled `fallbackT` turns that case red naming its own file, instead of
 * quietly serving an ungated table. Because the gate now reads THIS list rather
 * than a copy, that one ratchet covers both readers.
