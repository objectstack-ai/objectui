/**
 * objectui#11445 — a count that a word must agree with is an i18next count
 * family, in every pack. No other spelling of a count label may appear.
 *
 * ## What was broken
 *
 * objectui#11432 gave every i18next count family every CLDR category its
 * language selects, and `plural-categories-11432.test.ts` proves i18next
 * selects each slot. Two other spellings of the same defect sat outside that
 * rule, because i18next was not the one choosing:
 *
 *   - **code-selected pairs** — `detail.attachmentCount` / `…CountPlural`,
 *     `common.itemCount` / `…CountOne` and thirteen more. The component picked
 *     the key on `=== 1`, which gives a pack two slots; `ru` needs three integer
 *     forms and `ar` five, so `ru` read «3 вложений» and `ar` «2 مرفقات».
 *   - **single-form count keys** — one string at every count, so `ru` read
 *     «Согласовать 3 запросов?» and `en` itself «3 row modified».
 *
 * Both became families: the component passes `count`, and i18next picks the
 * slot `Intl.PluralRules` selects. From then on the two older pins judge them
 * by construction — `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` that every slot exists,
 * `plural-categories-11432.test.ts` that i18next selects it.
 *
 * ## What this file owns: that no third spelling appears unpinned
 *
 *   1. No pack holds a `…Plural` key. That was the code-selected pair's
 *      spelling; a component that picks a plural key itself is the defect.
 *   2. Every leaf that interpolates `{{count}}`, in any pack, is a member of a
 *      family — or is named on `COUNT_NEUTRAL` below with the reason no word
 *      agrees with its number. The `…One` spelling of a code-selected pair is
 *      caught here: its plural half interpolates `{{count}}` outside a family.
 *
 * The list can only shrink. Each entry must still exist, still interpolate
 * `{{count}}` and still be outside a family — so converting a key forces its
 * entry out, and a key cannot be listed in advance.
 *
 * ⛔ What this file does NOT judge: whether a family's WORDS are right in a
 * language (no test can; a translator does), and whether each call site passes
 * `count` as a NUMBER — i18next plural-selects nothing else
 * (`needsPluralHandling` is `count !== undefined && !isString(count)` in i18next
 * 26). `check:i18n-keys` holds every call site to passing `count`; the number
 * type is read at the call sites this card converted, not pinned.
