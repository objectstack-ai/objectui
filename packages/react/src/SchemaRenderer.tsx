 *
 *   - config bag: `readProps()` in the `element:*` family merges
 *     `{ ...schema.props, ...schema.properties }` — `properties` wins.
 *   - React prop: `createElement` below spread `...componentProps` (which
 *     carries the hoisted `properties.*` values) and then
 *     `...(evaluatedSchema.props || {})` LAST, which overwrote them —
 *     `props` won.
 *
 * Measured on one render of one node carrying both:
 * `bagRead(properties.content)="FROM_PROPERTIES"` while
 * `reactPropRead(content)="FROM_PROPS"`. Which one reached the screen depended
 * only on whether the renderer happened to be in the `readProps()` family.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling 2026-08-18: **`properties` wins on BOTH channels — one
 * answer per key.** The config-bag order was already correct and is untouched;
 * this narrowing is the React-prop half. It restores the declared posture
 * (`props` is an annotated legacy alias) rather than changing it.
 *
 * Implemented by REMOVING the overlapping keys from the alias spread rather
 * than by re-spreading `properties` after it. That matters: `properties.*` is
 * already on the node via the hoist, so the values are in `componentProps`
 * having passed the metadata strip. Re-spreading the raw bag would push
 * stripped schema metadata back out as React props — exactly the regression
 * that made a spec-documented `dataSource` binding shadow the injected adapter
 * and break the component (objectstack#5576). Subtracting adds no key to the
 * outgoing bag; it only decides which of two co-present values a key carries.
 *
 * Scope, deliberately narrow — this only moves a reading where BOTH bags
 * declare the same key:
 *   - a key only `props` declares is untouched (the alias keeps working);
 *   - a key only `properties` declares is untouched (it already won);
 *   - `type`/`id` are skipped, because the hoist never copied a canonical value
 *     up for them, so dropping the alias would DELETE the prop rather than
 *     replace it;
 *   - a degenerate (non-object) `properties` is left alone — there is no
 *     canonical bag to prefer, because a degenerate bag declares no key for
 *     either spelling to win. (This bullet used to explain the carve-out by
 *     saying "the hoist and `readProps()` both merely object-spread it". Half
 *     of that stopped being true at objectui#6760, which stopped the hoist from
 *     enumerating a degenerate bag; the carve-out itself is unaffected, since
 *     it never rested on what the hoist does with the value.)
 *
 * Adjacent but NOT decided here: objectui#4795's pending question ② (whether
 * the `properties` envelope is an official `ui:*` authoring channel at all).
 * This is a precedence rule between two co-present spellings and takes no

 *
 * ## The defect this closes (objectui#9100)
 *
 * `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluate` unwraps ANY `{ source: string }` object to its
 * bare `source` before it does anything else — that unwrap is what lets a
 * `{ dialect: 'template', source: '${data.total}' }` value interpolate. Applied
 * to a `{ dialect: 'cel' }` PREDICATE it is destructive instead: the envelope
 * is the only thing that tells {@link ExpressionEvaluator.evaluateCondition}
 * to route to the canonical `@objectstack/formula` engine, and the bag loops
 * run BEFORE the hoist, so by the time either consumer sees the key the
 * envelope is gone.
 *
 * Both consumers then read a bare string and both take the legacy JS path:
 *
 *   1. this component's own `shouldHide` chain, off the post-hoist node; and
 *   2. the RENDERER's `toPredicateInput(…)` → `useCondition(…)` call, one
 *      layer down (`record:alert`, the four `action:*` blocks, …), which wraps
 *      the bare string as `${…}` exactly as it is documented to.
 *
 * On the legacy engine a CEL stdlib call is simply not a function, so
 * `has(record.x) && …` throws — and the two polarities of the chain then fail
 * in OPPOSITE directions, both silently:
 *
 *   * on the four SHOW legs the fail-soft `true` is negated to "do not hide",
 *     so a gate authored to conceal renders on every row — measured in a real
 *     browser against a real app instance (the card), where a duplicate-lead
 *     banner showed on 6 of 6 leads whose field was `null`;
 *   * on the two HIDE legs the same `true` sets `_hidden`, so the node is not
 *     on screen at all.
 *
 * Neither is distinguishable from a predicate that said so on purpose. That is
 * what makes this a fail-OPEN visibility gate rather than a rendering glitch.
 *
 * ## Why the fix is HERE and not in the normalizer
 *
 * `toPredicateInput` already preserves a `cel` envelope — that is its whole
 * documented reason to exist (#2661 / #3314) — and the ACTION path that works
 * calls the very same function. Measured: mounting the renderer DIRECTLY with
 * the envelope gates correctly, and only the `SchemaRenderer` route fails, so
 * the envelope dies upstream of every consumer, in the loops below. What makes
 * the action path survive is that those loops are per-value and SHALLOW: an
 * action's predicate sits one level down inside the `actions[]` ARRAY, and
 * `evaluate` returns a non-string untouched, so nothing walks into it. A
 * `record:alert` `properties.visible` is a TOP-LEVEL bag key and is hit
 * head-on. Same normalizer, different depth.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Restricted to {@link VISIBILITY_CHAIN_KEYS} — the closed set this file
 * already declares and `shouldHide` / {@link winningVisibilityKey} already
 * consult. Every consumer of those six keys takes the envelope by contract
 * (`evaluateCondition`, `toPredicateInput`), and the metadata destructure near
 * `createElement` strips all six, so no object value can reach the DOM through
 * this. A non-predicate key keeps the flattening it has always had.

/**
 * Which CONSEQUENCE the diagnostic should print for a faulting predicate on
 * this leg (objectui#6503).
 *
 * ## The defect this closes
 *
 * `evaluateCondition` answers an unevaluable predicate with `true` on every
 * path. On the four SHOW legs the chain negates that answer, so the node is
 * SHOWN and the reporter's "the gate did NOT bite" is true. On the two HIDE
 * legs the chain returns it UN-negated (see `shouldHide` below), so the same
 * `true` sets `_hidden` and this component returns `null`: the gate bit, and
 * bit harder than on either sibling gate — the node is not on screen at all.
 * Both were routed to `'visibility'`, so an author whose block VANISHED read a
 * line telling them the gate did not bite and went looking for a rendering bug
 * that does not exist. The polarity was documented in
 * `visibilityDiagnostic.ts` and printed anyway; this is the routing that makes
 * the documented split the one that is actually applied.
 *
 * ## Why derived from the two constants, when the reporter refuses to deduce
 *
 * `PredicateGateKind`'s docblock refuses to deduce the gate from `key` INSIDE
 * the reporter, and that refusal stands: the reporter is exported and called
 * from other packages, where an unheard-of spelling would silently inherit
 * some other gate's sentence. Here the caller IS the chain. The two arrays
 * above are the same declaration `shouldHide` and {@link winningVisibilityKey}
 * consult, and {@link VisibilityChainKey} closes the parameter over them, so
 * this is not a second table that can drift from the first — it is the same
 * one, read for a second question. It also removes the failure mode that
 * produced this card: a leg added to the chain and left with a consequence
 * sentence written about a different polarity is now a TYPE error here, not a
 * line of false console copy.
 *
 * The `disabled` / `disabledOn` gate is deliberately not reachable from this
 * function: those legs are not in the visibility chain and route through
 * `evaluateEnablementPredicate`, which states `'enablement'` at its own call
 * site.

 * (first-declared-wins across {@link VISIBILITY_SHOW_KEYS} then
 * {@link VISIBILITY_HIDE_KEYS}) — without waiting for either to run.
 *
 * ## Why this exists (objectui#5756)
 *
 * A `${…}` template written as `properties.visible` is evaluated — and
 * collapsed to a plain boolean — by the loop that runs BEFORE the hoist, in
 * the SAME render pass. By the time `shouldHide` runs, the predicate TEXT is
 * gone; there is nothing left to diagnose. Reaching it means asking "does
 * THIS properties key actually decide?" at the one point in the render where
 * the raw text still exists — which means asking the precedence question
 * EARLY, on values the hoist has not yet merged and `shouldHide` has not yet
 * consulted.
 *
 * ## Why the precedence question, and not just "is it in `properties`?"
 *
 * Without it, a `properties.visible` template that a co-declared `visibleWhen`
 * OUTRANKS (exactly `shouldHide`'s own early-return: `visibleWhen` short-
 * circuits before `visible` is ever reached) would be reported even though it
 * decides nothing — a false positive for a leg that never runs. Restricting
 * the report to the WINNING key mirrors what `shouldHide` already does for
 * every OTHER key spelling (objectui#5454's leg-3 reporter is only ever
 * invoked on the leg that is actually consulted, by construction of the same
 * early-return chain) rather than inventing a different posture for this one.
 *
 * ## Why `node.properties` must already be POST-evaluation here
 *
 * The caller runs this AFTER the `properties.*` evaluation loop (so
 * `node.properties.visible` may already be the collapsed boolean, not the raw
 * template) and BEFORE the hoist (so a plain node-level key, untouched by that
 * loop, is still exactly what `shouldHide` will see). That ordering is what
 * makes "declared" answered here agree bit-for-bit with what `shouldHide`
 * answers later — including the corner a naive PRE-evaluation read would get
 * wrong: a template that evaluates to a literal `undefined` (e.g.
 * `${data.missing}` read alone) is `!== undefined` on its RAW text but not on
 * its EVALUATED value, and `shouldHide` falls through to the next key for
 * exactly that reason. Reading pre-eval text here would call `visible` the
 * winner when the real chain does not.
 *
 * Read-only: decides nothing about visibility itself, only which key a
 * DIAGNOSTIC should look at.

/**
 * The renderer loop.

 * ## The explicit type annotation is the contract, and it is deliberate
 *
 * `forwardRef< T, P >` routes `P` through React's `PropsWithoutRef`:
 *
 *     Props extends any ? ('ref' extends keyof Props ? Omit< Props, 'ref' > : Props) : Props
 *
 * A string index signature on `P` puts `string` into `keyof Props`, so
 * `'ref' extends keyof Props` is ALWAYS true, the `Omit` branch always runs, and
 * `Omit` over a type carrying a string index signature keeps ONLY the index
 * signature. Every declared prop is erased — on both sides. This component used
 * to hand `forwardRef` a props type of `{ schema: SchemaNode } & Record< string,
 * any >`, so its own `schema` resolved to `any` at every one of the ~376 call
 * sites in this repo, and was not even REQUIRED: `< SchemaRenderer / >` with no
 * schema at all type-checked (objectui#4548, measured).
 *
 * The fix is NOT to close the surface. This is the renderer loop: it forwards
 * every prop it does not read to the component the schema names, resolved at
 * RUNTIME from a plugin-extensible `ComponentRegistry`. That forwarding is a
 * documented, load-bearing feature — `packages/react/README.md` shows
 * `< SchemaRenderer schema={formSchema} onSubmit={handleSubmit} / >`, and
 * `@object-ui/components`' form renderer consumes that `onSubmit` as a React
 * prop. A closed props type would state a FALSE contract and would force every
 * leaf plugin's props into this package to stay usable.
 *
 * So the two halves are separated deliberately:
 *
 *   * the `forwardRef` TYPE ARGUMENT is the honest `SchemaRendererProps`, with
 *     no index signature — nothing for `PropsWithoutRef` to collapse, so
 *     `schema` survives to the call site typed and required; and
 *   * the open forwarding surface is stated ONCE, here, in this export
 *     annotation. Because the annotation is applied to the already-built
 *     component, `PropsWithoutRef` never runs over it, so `Record< string, any >`
 *     widens the surface WITHOUT erasing anything.
 *
 * The repo-wide guard (`scripts/__tests__/forwardref-props-erasure.guard.test.ts`)
 * judges the TYPE ARGUMENT only, for exactly this reason: an index signature
 * there is an accidental eraser, whereas one here is a stated contract.

     * Evaluate ONE visibility predicate, and make an unresolvable one LOUD
     * (objectui#5454, leg 3 of the 2026-08-21 ruling).
     *
     * ## The verdict is byte-for-byte what it was — only the silence moved
     *
     * `evaluateCondition` answers an unresolvable predicate with `true`, on
     * every one of its three internal paths: the CEL envelope fails soft to its
     * `true` fallback, a bare expression that throws is caught and returns
     * `true`, and a `${…}` template that throws returns its own SOURCE TEXT,
     * which is a non-empty string and therefore truthy. Passing
     * `throwOnError: true` changes none of those verdicts — it only converts
     * "could not evaluate" from a value into a throw — so this helper returns
     * `true` from the catch and reproduces the old answer exactly. That is why
     * it is safe on the two NON-negated legs (`hidden` / `hiddenOn`) as well,
     * where the same `true` means HIDE rather than SHOW.
     *
     * ## Why it needed saying at all
     *
     * A fail-soft surface answers "this predicate is broken" and "this
     * predicate said yes" with the same word. On the negated legs that word is
     * SHOWN, so a `record.*` gate written before objectui#5454 bound the row
     * rendered its block unconditionally and looked exactly like a gate the
     * author had got right. One of the three paths was already loud — the CEL
     * envelope's `evalFieldPredicate` warns (objectstack#5149) — and the other
     * two were mute, so whether an author heard about their own typo depended
     * on which dialect they happened to write it in.
     *
     * Deduped per (node type, key, predicate source): a broken predicate is
     * re-evaluated on every render, and the point is one line, not a wall. The
     * key is the predicate SOURCE TEXT plus the gate it was authored on — never
     * the render and never the schema object — so the same broken predicate
     * rendered over two hundred rows reports once, and a SECOND distinct
     * predicate still reports (objectui#6038 pins both halves).
     *
     * ## Production is loud too, since objectui#6038
     *
     * It was `__DEV__`-only, and the maintainer's 2026-08-25 ruling retired
     * that silence: a gate that stops biting in production used to leave
     * nothing on the console for the bare-string dialect, so a class-1 defect
     * could sit live and undiscovered (measured in objectstack#11254). The
     * `__DEV__` gate below no longer decides WHETHER the fault is reported,
     * only HOW it is detected — see the two branches.
     *
     * ## Defined HERE, ahead of the `properties` evaluation loop below
     *
     * It used to sit just above `shouldHide`, its only caller. objectui#5756
     * added a second call site — inside the `properties` loop below, on the
     * raw (pre-evaluation) text of whichever key that loop is about to collapse
     * — so the definition moved up to be in scope for both. Nothing about the
     * function changed; `shouldHide` below still calls it exactly as before,
     * on the POST-evaluation, POST-hoist schema, for the real verdict.

     * ## Why this pair needed its own card at all
     *
     * Six legs of the visibility chain above route through
     * {@link evaluateVisibilityPredicate} and report. These two called
     * `evaluateCondition` BARE, so a faulting `disabled` predicate had never
     * been reported in any build, in any dialect that does not report on its
     * own — the only uninstrumented predicate pair left in this file.
     *
     * And it is the pair where the fail-soft default BITES. `evaluateCondition`
     * answers an unevaluable predicate with `true`; on the negated visibility
     * legs that means SHOWN, here it means GREYED OUT. The asymmetry this file
     * already records for objectui#3862/#3955 cuts the other way for the
     * console: "a greyed-out control is still on screen", so the user has a
     * symptom and the author has nothing to grep for. That is why the reporter
     * is handed a different consequence paragraph (`'enablement'`) rather than
     * the visibility copy, which states the opposite of what this gate did.
     *
     * ## The verdict is byte-for-byte what it was
     *
     * `evaluateCondition(raw)` with an `onFault` callback returns exactly what
     * `evaluateCondition(raw)` returned: `onFault` is invoked for its side
     * effect and its return value is ignored (objectui#6038's seam). Fail-soft
     * is PRESERVED deliberately — flipping it is a shipped-behaviour change on
     * a live surface and is not this card's to make.
     *
     * ## One engine call, both builds — still true after objectui#6504
     *
     * The FAULT report above is unconditional either way: `onFault` alone
     * covers both builds, one engine call, one code path, dev and production
     * print the same line by construction. objectui#6504 adds a SECOND,
     * dev-only check after that same call returns — not a second evaluation,
     * a lexical scan of the already-available predicate source and the
     * already-available `dataSource` — so production keeps its one-call,
     * one-path shape exactly as this docblock described before this leg
     * existed; only development pays for the extra check, and only after a
     * clean (non-faulting) evaluation.
     *
     * ## objectui#5687's diagnostic, extended (objectui#6504, maintainer
     * ruling 2026-08-27 option A)
     *
     * Was deliberately NOT called here — see the card this replaces filed at
     * objectui#6504: the 2026-08-22 ruling was scoped to the visibility gate,
     * and its message text ("a constant `false` hides the node on every row")
     * is not what a constant does to a `disabled` gate. The 2026-08-27 ruling
     * answers both gaps: extend to `disabled` / `disabledOn`, dev-only exactly
     * as the visibility leg is (⛔ always-on was excluded, outside the #5687
     * precedent), with its OWN copy — the constant-`true` direction, since on
     * THIS gate that is the polarity that greys the control out in silence.
     * `ADAPTER_ONLY_GATE_COPY['enablement']` (`visibilityDiagnostic.ts`) is
     * that copy, and it carries the same #5330 dissolution pointer #5687's
     * entry does: both legs retire together when that window closes.
     *
     * Reachable only on the branch where the predicate evaluated CLEANLY —
     * `faulted` mirrors {@link evaluateVisibilityPredicate}'s try/catch split
     * without paying for a second (`throwOnError`) engine call: `onFault` is
     * already told exactly when the single call it wraps did not produce a
     * clean verdict, so a local flag reuses that same signal instead of
     * re-deriving it. A predicate that faults is the OTHER reporter's case,
     * immediately above, in the same way it already is on the visibility leg.

     * the loop above (so `newSchema.properties` already reflects which key
     * would win the SAME precedence `shouldHide` applies later — see
     * {@link winningVisibilityKey}).
     *
     * A `${…}`-spelled visibility predicate written inside `properties` is
     * evaluated — and collapsed to a plain boolean — by the loop directly
     * above, before `shouldHide` (and its #5454/#5687 reporter) ever sees it.
     * The bare-string spelling of the SAME gate (`properties: { visible:
     * "data.status == 'draft'" }`) is untouched by that loop (no `${` to
     * interpolate) and reaches `shouldHide` intact, where the existing
     * reporter already catches it — this block exists only to give the
     * template spelling the same fate, not a different one.
     *
     * ## What this does NOT do
     *
     * - **No verdict change.** This call's return value is discarded; the
     *   REAL verdict is still decided by `shouldHide` below, off the
     *   POST-evaluation, POST-hoist schema, exactly as before this card.
     * - **No new report shape.** It is the SAME `evaluateVisibilityPredicate`
     *   `shouldHide` calls — same two reporters, same dedupe `Set`, same
     *   `__DEV__` gate — called one render-step earlier, on the text this
     *   step is about to erase. There is nothing here to duplicate the LATER
     *   call: by the time `shouldHide` runs, this key's value is already the
     *   collapsed boolean, which carries no `data.` text for either reporter
     *   to match — so at most one of the two calls ever fires per predicate.
     * - **Only the WINNING key.** Gated on {@link winningVisibilityKey} so a
     *   `properties.visible` template that a co-declared `visibleWhen`
     *   outranks is not reported for deciding nothing (mirrors #5454's own
     *   leg semantics: its reporter is likewise only ever invoked on the leg
     *   `shouldHide` actually consults).
     * - **Only what would actually collapse.** A bare string (no `${`) is
     *   untouched by the loop above and is left for the existing gate-time
     *   report to catch, unchanged.

    // node keys at all (objectui#6760). Measured on `c6732825d`, this branch's
    // base, with no part of that card in the tree: `properties: 'not-a-bag'`
    // reached the element as nine React props named `0` … `8`, and
    // `properties: ['x', 'y']` as `0`, `1`. Nobody authored those keys — they
    // are `Object.entries`' reading of a string's character indices, and the
    // values this loop writes onto the node are spread as React props at the
    // `createElement` below.
    //
    // ## Which arm, and why this one
    //
    // objectui#6760 left two open, both cheap, both reversible, neither on the
    // manual floor (the objectui#6708 census walked every JSON document, every
    // `json` doc fence and every TypeScript object literal and found ZERO
    // authored degenerate config bags):
    //
    //   (a) guard the hoist the way the evaluation memo above is guarded;
    //   (b) rule that the hoist may enumerate whatever it is handed, and say
    //       so here.
    //
    // Arm (a), for three reasons, in the order they were weighed:
    //
    //  1. **One answer per key, whichever channel reads it.** That is
    //     objectui#5123's ruling (maintainer, 2026-08-18), and arm (b) breaks
    //     it in the loudest available place: after objectui#6752,
    //     `props: 'not-a-bag'` contributes no keys, so arm (b) would answer the
    //     SAME authored mistake two ways depending on which of two spellings of
    //     ONE bag the author used — and the reinterpreting half would be
    //     `properties`, the SPEC spelling, while the quiet half is `props`, the
    //     annotated legacy alias. A rule that punishes the canonical spelling
    //     is not a rule anyone can teach.
    //  2. **The reason for the guard was measured, and it is channel-**
    //     **independent.** objectui#6752 established it by ablation rather than
    //     by reading a comment (see the evaluation memo above): what a config-bag
    //     guard buys is the AUTHORED value's shape, which has nothing to do with
    //     which bag or which site is asking. The hoist is a third site asking the
    //     same question about the same authored value; a third answer would be
    //     drift, which is what {@link isConfigBag} exists to end (objectui#6761).
    //  3. **The failure it prevents is silent and lands on generated metadata.**
    //     A degenerate bag is a mistake an author (increasingly, an AI writing
    //     metadata) makes by writing `properties: 'text'` where a bag belongs.
    //     Arm (b) turns that into nine plausible-looking props with no warning
    //     anywhere; arm (a) makes it inert, so the mistake stays legible as the
    //     `properties` value the author actually wrote.
    //
    // What arm (a) does NOT change, measured rather than assumed: a real object
    // bag hoists exactly as before (`type`/`id` still protected above), and
    // `properties: 42` / `properties: true` were already contributing nothing
    // — `Object.entries` yields no entries for them, so this guard only ever
    // moves the string and array cases. Pinned in
    // `__tests__/SchemaRenderer.degeneratePropertiesHoist.test.tsx`.

     * Evaluate the SPEC-DECLARED, expression-bindable TOP-LEVEL text keys
     * (objectui#4795 Direction 1, maintainer ruling 2026-08-25).
     *
     * ## The hole this closes
     *
     * A value reaches the screen only if it is BOTH evaluated here AND read
     * back by the renderer off the node. `content` above satisfies both; the
     * other text keys satisfied neither at once, so
     * `{ type: 'statistic', value: '${data.total}' }` — whose renderer reads
     * `schema.value` (`data-display/statistic.tsx`) — put the literal
     * `${data.total}` on screen, and the `props`-envelope workaround the
     * objectui#4786 teaching rewrite retired rendered BLANK instead (evaluated,
     * then spread as a React prop nobody reads). `statistic` is the dashboard
     * workhorse and had no way at all to bind a dynamic value.
     *
     * ## Why this is ONE leg here and not a patch in each renderer
     *
     * The ruling's own implementation caution: the read-back sites must be
     * "converged on evaluated values, not patched per component". They already
     * agree on WHERE to read (the node's top level) — what they lacked was
     * anything writing an evaluated value there. Writing it at the single
     * producer of evaluated schema means `statistic.tsx`, `card.tsx` and
     * `button.tsx` are UNCHANGED by this card and every future top-level reader
     * is covered by construction. Four fixed components and no contract was the
     * failure mode named at dispatch.
     *
     * ## The vocabulary is the spec's, and is consumed rather than copied
     *
     * `@objectstack/spec` declares it (objectstack#9599): the closed set
     * `title` / `label` / `value` / `description`, plus the per-component
     * carriage map saying which of them each component type actually reads
     * back. The 2026-08-18 ruling is explicit that this memo CONSUMES the
     * declaration "rather than hard-coding a twin list" — so the only thing
     * this file knows is the name of the lookup. A row added upstream starts
     * working here with no edit; a row this file invented would be the second
     * dialect the declaration exists to prevent.
     *
     * ## The type string is passed VERBATIM
     *
     * `expressionBindableTextKeysFor` keys on the bare registry name, and the
     * spec states the answer for an unlisted type is the empty set — "closed
     * and mechanically answerable in both directions, never inferred from what
     * a renderer happens to read". So no prefix-stripping normalization: it
     * would look harmless (`ui:statistic` → `statistic`) and would in the same
     * motion grant rows to `element:button` and `page:card`, whose renderers
     * read their config out of the bag via `readProps()` and never touch these
     * keys on the node — re-manufacturing the evaluated-but-not-read-back half
     * of the very table this card exists to close. Measured on this tree: the
     * authored corpus spells these types bare (`statistic` 42, `card` 135,
     * `button` 158 nodes) and `ui:*` zero times, so verbatim is also the
     * spelling authors actually use. `action:button` (5 nodes) has no row and
     * is reported upstream rather than inferred here.
     *
     * ## Ordering and idempotence
     *
     * After the `properties` hoist deliberately, exactly like `content`: a
     * value arriving through that channel was already evaluated by the
     * `properties` leg, so it no longer carries a `${…}` and
     * `evaluator.evaluate` returns it unchanged. The `typeof === 'string'`
     * guard is doing real work rather than mirroring the line above — it stops
     * this loop CREATING an absent key as `undefined`, which would change what
     * `{ ...schema }` spreads and what `key in schema` answers downstream.

   * SDUI scoped styling (ADR-0065): a node's `responsiveStyles` compiles to
   * id-scoped CSS injected as a `<style>` tag, and a scope class is appended to
   * the node's className.
   *
   * ## Why this is a memo, and why it is HERE and not at its use site
   *
   * The scope-class branch rebuilds the schema object (`{ ...evaluatedSchema,
   * className: mergedClassName }`) so renderers that read `schema.className`
   * see the scope class. Unmemoised, that spread allocated a NEW object on
   * every render of this component — even when the `evaluatedSchema` memo
   * directly above it HELD — so every downstream renderer that memoises on
   * `[schema]` (e.g. `ObjectMap`'s `dataConfig` / `mapConfig`, and the whole
   * marker cascade below them) saw a fresh identity and re-ran (objectui#6270).
   * Only nodes taking this branch were affected: a plain node was handed
   * `evaluatedSchema` itself and was already stable.
   *
   * It is hoisted ABOVE the early returns below because it is a HOOK. Its use
   * site sits after `if (!evaluatedSchema) return null`, the `_hidden` return
   * and the unresolved-component returns, so a `useMemo` written there is a
   * CONDITIONAL hook: a node toggling hidden -> visible would call one more
   * hook than the previous render and React would throw "Rendered more hooks
   * than during the previous render". Hoisting is what makes the memo legal,
   * not a stylistic preference.
   *
   * `[evaluatedSchema, autoStyleId]` is the complete dependency set: every
   * value below is a pure function of the evaluated node (`className`, `id`,
   * `responsiveStyles`) and the `useId` fallback. `evaluatedSchema` is itself a
   * fresh object whenever anything it interpolates changes, so a genuinely
   * changed className, value or breakpoint still produces a NEW identity here —
   * memoising cannot make a live value go stale.
   *
   * Non-object / primitive nodes fall through untouched: the render pass below
   * returns them as text before any of this is read.
