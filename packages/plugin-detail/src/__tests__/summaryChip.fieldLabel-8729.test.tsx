/**
 * The summary chip beside the record H1 names its field the way its SIBLINGS
 * name theirs (objectui#8729).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The chip carries no visible label, so `${field}: ${value}` is the whole of
 * what a screen-reader user hears the field called — and the name half was
 * `fieldName`, the raw stored column. Every other band of the same page
 * resolves a label through one shared helper: `HeaderHighlight` calls
 * `fieldLabel(objectName, field.name, field.label)`, `DetailSection` calls it
 * with `field.label || field.name`. So one band out of several announced the
 * database spelling, and it was the band only a screen-reader user hears.
 *
 * ⇒ this is a DIVERGENCE from an in-repo pattern, not a missing capability, and
 * the fix is the sibling's own call. Which is why the headline case below is
 * stated as AGREEMENT WITH THE STRIP — read out of the strip's own DOM, never
 * re-derived here. A per-chip `toBe('Account Owner: …')` would go green on a
 * repair that humanized the name differently from its siblings, which is the
 * same defect one level up.
 *
 * ## The three name sites, because the chip has three render branches
 *
 * A census of the chip's render (objectui#8464 gave it a cell-renderer branch;
 * objectui#8728 a percent branch) finds the field name reaching a reader in
 * THREE places, and a fix touching only `aria-label` would have left one:
 *
 *  1. the string branch's `aria-label`;
 *  2. the percent branch's `aria-label`;
 *  3. the renderer branch's `sr-only` prefix span — content, not `aria-label`,
 *     because an `aria-label` there would OVERRIDE the element the branch
 *     exists to draw (objectui#8464's own reasoning, unchanged here).
 *
 * `data-summary-chip` is a fourth appearance of the raw name and is NOT one of
 * these: it is a machine handle for tests and automation, where the stored
 * column is exactly the right answer. Every navigation below uses it.
 *
 * ## Reading the accessible name — MEASURED, both branches
 *
 * Measured on this branch with `toHaveAccessibleName` (jest-dom over
 * dom-accessibility-api), because the two branches do NOT compute the same way
 * and assuming they did would have made half these assertions vacuous:
 *
 *  - string / percent branch — the `Badge` is a `div` carrying `aria-label`,
 *    and the computed accessible name is that label, verbatim. There is no
 *    `title`, no `aria-labelledby` and no visible label anywhere on the chip,
 *    so it really is the whole name.
 *  - renderer branch — the same `div` carries NO `aria-label`, and its computed
 *    accessible name is the EMPTY STRING: the name is not composed from the
 *    `sr-only` span, because a plain `div` is `role="generic"`, which takes no
 *    name from its content. What that span buys is what a reader is READ: the
 *    chip's text, announced in document order. So case 3 asserts the chip's
 *    TEXT, and does not pretend to be an accessible-name assertion.
 *
 * ## Controls
 *
 * "The stored name is gone" is trivially true of a chip that stopped rendering,
 * so every case reads a chip that is on screen and asserts what it says. Two
 * more controls guard the edges the fix must not move:
 *
 *  - `STORED NAME IS THE LABEL` — a field whose authored label equals its
 *    stored name must announce byte-for-byte as before;
 *  - `THE PERCENTAGE HALF` — objectui#9072 (card objectui#8728) left this card
 *    a free hand over the NAME half by asserting only the percentage half. That
 *    half is re-asserted here, from this side, so this card cannot move it.
