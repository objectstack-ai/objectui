/**
 * `AIInsightsSchema` and the `ai-insights` node type stay RETIRED (objectui#8800,
 * ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).
 *
 * Director-seat ruling, decision batch #137 item 2, 2026-09-15, maintainer
 * verbatim 「同意」, letter **A**: the declaration and its `@object-ui/types`
 * barrel export go. **B** (write a renderer) and **C** (keep it as a documented
 * forward declaration) were refused in the same breath, so a re-added
 * declaration is a published-contract decision and ⛔ never a convenience — the
 * same reason `block-family-retired-4895.test.ts` exists beside its tombstone.
 *
 * ## Why it was retired, in one line each
 *
 * NOTHING ever registered the discriminant, so no node of that spelling reached
 * a renderer: `SchemaRenderer` resolved it to the OBJUI-001 "Unknown component
 * type" panel and the CLI validator called it an unknown schema type. Both
 * refusals are LOUD — ⛔ this was never a silent swallow — but both are at RUN
 * time, while `tsc` said yes because the declaration was on the published
 * `.d.ts`. The retirement moves the refusal to authoring time.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The limit this pin inherits and does NOT close
 *
 * Every census below is the **IN-REPO HALF**. `git grep` reads this repository's
 * TRACKED files and nothing else: ⛔ not customer applications, ⛔ not published
 * documents, ⛔ not tenant metadata at rest, ⛔ not untracked files. A zero here
 * is a reading about this tree. `@object-ui/types` is published, so an external
 * TypeScript consumer that authored the node is structurally unobservable from
 * here — it gets a compile error naming the symbol, and the changeset's FROM/TO
 * is what it greps. The ruling was taken with this limit attached and ⛔ this file
 * does not quietly upgrade it.
 *
 * ## Three instruments, and why the obvious fourth is absent
 *
 *   - `tsc` sees the `@ts-expect-error` legs. They are the ONLY half that
 *     discriminates the retirement from its absence, because a retired type is a
 *     TypeScript-only refusal. They mean nothing unless `type-check` runs —
 *     vitest strips types. This package compiles every test file
 *     (`tsconfig.test.json`), which is what makes them real.
 *   - vitest reads the two declaration files as TEXT, so a re-introduced
 *     interface reddens even in a run that never type-checks.
 *   - vitest scans the whole TRACKED tree for both spellings, with lit controls
 *     drawn from the three AI siblings that DO render.
 *   - ⛔ The fourth — a runtime `name in module` check, the shape
 *     `block-family-retired-4895.test.ts` uses — is deliberately NOT here, and
 *     the reason is worth more than the leg: `AIInsightsSchema` was an
 *     `export type`, so it was never in any runtime namespace to begin with.
 *     That assertion would have passed identically before this retirement and
 *     after it. A leg that cannot tell the two worlds apart is not evidence, and
 *     writing it down would make this file look better covered than it is.
 *     ⚠️ `./blocks.ts` earned that leg because the block family had zod mirrors
 *     shipping as runtime values; this family has no zod mirror at all, which is
 *     asserted below rather than assumed.
