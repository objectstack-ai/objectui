 * objectui#10199 — the authoring face declares `record:related_list`'s
 * TOP-LEVEL `filter` as the protocol's rule ARRAY, not as `any`.
 *
 * The defect: `RecordRelatedListComponentProps.filter` was `any`, while
 * `@objectstack/spec` declares `RecordRelatedListProps.filter` as
 * `z.array(ViewFilterRuleSchema)`. The face an author (or an AI writing
 * metadata) reads therefore said "anything" for a key the protocol constrains,
 * and a fixture in this package authored an array of `[field, op, value]`
 * tuples against it without any compiler noticing.
 *
 * ## What the ruling moved, and what it deliberately left alone
 *
 * Ruled protocol first on objectui#10199: the AUTHORING face carries the
 * protocol's array. The CONSUMER — `@object-ui/plugin-detail`'s `RelatedList` —
 * keeps its `ViewFilterRule[] | FilterNode` union, because the `FilterNode` half
 * is the value `ElementDataSourceGate` composes at RUNTIME (component AND view
 * AND binding) and writes through its own untyped schema copy. That value is
 * not an authorable shape, so the composed AST is one of the shapes this face
 * must now REFUSE. The runtime hand-off it feeds is not typed through this
 * interface and is not pinned here: that half lives with the consumer, in
 * `RelatedList.listFilter.test.tsx` ("accepts the AST node
 * `ElementDataSourceGate` composes, without converting it twice") and in
 * `RecordRelatedListRenderer.elementDataSource.test.tsx` ("hands the composed
 * view-AND-binding filter to the list"). `FilterNode` lives in
 * `@object-ui/core`, which this zero-dependency package cannot import.
 *
 * ## Why this file drives `tsc` instead of rendering something
 *
 * `any` and `ViewFilterRule[]` are the same zero bytes at runtime, so a
 * behavioural test is green on the defect and on the fix alike. The property
 * under test is what the COMPILER accepts, read two ways:
 *
 *   - the TYPE-LEVEL legs (`Expect`, `@ts-expect-error`) are compiled by
 *     `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` (this package's `type-check` script) and
 *     erased by vitest;
 *   - the DIAGNOSTIC legs compile authored snippets against the real mirror
 *     SOURCE through the TypeScript API and read the diagnostics back, so the
 *     same property also fails under vitest. Same mechanism as
 *     `related-list-add-picker-filter-mirror-9964.test.ts`, the sibling repair
 *     on this interface.
 *
 * ## The expectation is DERIVED, not written down
 *
 * The mirror is compared with `@objectstack/spec`'s own `RecordRelatedListProps`
 * every run (AGENTS.md #9), and every probe the compiler refuses is also handed
 * to the protocol's own parse: the two faces must agree on each one.
 *
 * ## Discrimination is built in
 *
 * Every diagnostic case is compiled a SECOND time against the PRE-FIX
 * declaration (the same mirror with `filter` put back to `any`, nothing else
 * changed). `EXPECTED_FLIPS` names exactly which cases that reverts.
