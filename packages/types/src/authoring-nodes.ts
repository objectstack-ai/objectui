/**
 * TypeScript AUTHORING types for the nodes `@objectstack/spec` declares and the
 * renderer draws, derived BY REFERENCE (objectui#11364, the preparation
 * objectui#8347's `BaseSchema` index-signature removal needs; direction from
 * objectui#7927's ruling, "the real extension keys are declared").
 *
 * ## Why these exist
 *
 * `BaseSchema` carried `[key: string]: any`, so every key on every node
 * compiled. objectui#8347 removed it, so a node may author only the keys some
 * TypeScript declaration names. The nodes below had none: an `element:text`
 * with its `properties` bag, a `page:tabs` with `properties.items`, an
 * `action:button` with its executor keys in the bag (objectui#11183), and a
 * stored page document handed to `SchemaRenderer` under its page kind. Each of
 * them is declared by the spec, and the renderer draws it. objectui#11468 adds
 * the other authored `properties`-bag carriers the zod face arms: the eight
 * ObjectQL blocks (`object-map`, `object-grid`, …) and `flex`.
 *
 * ## How each one is derived
 *
 *   - {@link PublicBlockNode}: one member per arm of
 *     `PublicBlockComponentSchema` (`./zod/public-blocks.zod.ts`), each the
 *     arm's own `z.input`. The arm is `BaseSchema.extend(...)`, and the zod
 *     `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`, so a bare `z.input` of it carries
 *     `[k: string]: unknown`, which would put back the index signature
 *     objectui#8347 removed. So the arm's SHAPE is read and the object's
 *     config is left closed. Every member, value type and refusal is the arm's,
 *     and through the arm the spec row's (`propsBag`); nothing is restated, and
 *     an arm added to that union is typed here the same day.
 *   - {@link ObjectQLPublicBlockNode} and {@link FlexBlockNode}
 *     (objectui#11468): the same derivation, over the arms of
 *     `ObjectQLPublicBlockComponentSchema` (`./zod/objectql.zod.ts`) and over
 *     `FlexBlockSchema` (`./zod/layout.zod.ts`), the authored
 *     `properties`-bag carriers outside `PublicBlockComponentSchema`. Two of
 *     their bags are not spec rows: `flex` and `object-chart` have no
 *     `ComponentPropsMap` row, so each bag is its flat mirror's own members,
 *     kept `.passthrough()` for the tolerant face (objectui#11276). The
 *     derivation reads a bag's shape the way it reads the arm's, so the type
 *     is closed where the strict authoring face closes it. A spec-row bag is
 *     already closed, and the derivation changes nothing for it. One member
 *     of `flex`'s bag is read off the flat mirror instead of the arm: its
 *     `children`, whose list the arm leaves to the spec page walk and this
 *     face types as nodes (objectui#11564, at `FlexBlockShape`).
 *   - {@link ElementTextInputNode} and {@link ElementRecordPickerNode}: no zod
 *     arm exists for these two. `AnyComponentSchema` still refuses both at
 *     `type`, and `registered-types-validate-ratchet-10859` in
 *     `@object-ui/cli` counts that population. The spec carries both rows
 *     (`ComponentPropsMap`), so each node is built the way an arm is built:
 *     the zod `BaseSchema` shape extended with the `type` literal, the node
 *     envelope (`NODE_ENVELOPE`: `responsiveStyles`, which `SchemaRenderer`
 *     compiles on every node), `properties` as the row, and the `body` /
 *     `children` tombstones, each by reference. The spec's own
 *     `PageComponentSchema` refuses a node-level `children` on both types as an
 *     unrecognized key, as it does on `element:text`.
 *     `element:record_picker` also declares `dataSource` (the
 *     spec's `ElementDataSourceSchema`), because its renderer reads the node's
 *     binding, the same rule `ElementNumberBlockSchema` follows. Its bag leaves
 *     `object` optional, because the spec's props gate waives that one member
 *     beside a `dataSource.object` for every row that requires it. A type
 *     cannot carry the waiver's condition, which is also true of the
 *     `element:number` arm's `z.input`.
 *   - {@link PageDocumentNode}: the spec's `PageSchema` input. `PageView`
 *     hands a stored page to `SchemaRenderer` with its page KIND written into
 *     `type` (objectui#9642), so `type` is required here, while the spec
 *     defaults it; every kind but the interface-mode `list`, which never
 *     reaches `SchemaRenderer`. `PageNodeSchema` is the separate
 *     `type: 'page'` node, and stays as it is.
 *
 * ## What these types do
 *
 * {@link AuthoringNode} is one of the three parts of `DeclaredNode`
 * (`./base.ts`, objectui#11466), beside the component schemas this package
 * declares and the types an application declares in `CustomNodeRegistry`.
 * `DeclaredNode` is the object arm of `SchemaNode`, so every node slot takes
 * these types, and it is what `SchemaRendererProps.schema` (`@object-ui/react`)
 * takes beside a string. The union has no `type: string` arm, so TypeScript
 * discriminates on the literal `type`: a node of one of these types has its own
 * keys judged wherever it is written, nested in a slot or at the prop, and its
 * required keys are required. A misspelled key inside an `element:text` bag, or
 * a bag on a node type that declares none, is refused now that objectui#8347
 * has removed `BaseSchema`'s index signature (`authoring-nodes-11364.test.ts` and
 * `node-slot-union-11466.test.ts` pin it).
 *
 * Before that removal, the component-schema members that extend `BaseSchema`
 * carried its index signature, so a misspelled key on one of THEM compiled.
 * These members never carried one, and since the removal neither do they.

 * (`SchemaNode | SchemaNode[]`, the slot every node slot takes since
 * objectui#11466). Every other member, of the node and of the bag, is the
 * arm's.
 *
 * ## Why this one member is not the arm's (objectui#11564)
 *
 * The arm's bag member is `FLEX_BAG_CHILDREN` (`./zod/layout.zod.ts`), whose
 * list arm is `z.array(z.unknown())`. That is right for the zod faces: a list
 * at `properties.children` is a position `@objectstack/spec`'s page walk
 * descends, so each entry is judged as a component there, once, at its real
 * path (`./zod/nested-component-walk.ts`, objectui#11223). Its input type is
 * `unknown[]`, though, and nothing on the TypeScript face does what the walk
 * does. So read off the arm, the list, which is the form a `flex` node is
 * authored in, took any entry at all, and would have stayed unchecked after
 * objectui#8347 removed `BaseSchema`'s index signature, while a single child was
 * judged as a node. The mirror's member is the accept set the walk and the single-node arm
 * judge between them.
 *
 * The zod arm does not move. The divergence is recorded where the mirror
 * ledger records this arm (`EXCLUSIONS` in
 * `__tests__/zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`) and pinned in
 * `__tests__/flex-bag-children-list-11564.test.ts`. Both faces judge an object
 * entry as a node of its own `type`: an undeclared `type` is refused by both,
 * and a key the node does not declare is refused by the strict zod face and,
 * since objectui#8347 removed the index signature, by this type (before it the
 * signature absorbed it on the node types that extend `BaseSchema`, as it did
 * for a single child). A primitive entry is admitted by both. They differ on
 * one entry kind: a nested array, which the walk passes through unvisited and
 * this type refuses, as the mirror does and as `renderChildren`
 * (`@object-ui/components`) treats it, handing it to `SchemaRenderer` whole.
 *
 * A `properties` member that is not an optional zod object makes this
 * `never`, so every `flex` literal stops compiling rather than silently losing
 * the bag.
