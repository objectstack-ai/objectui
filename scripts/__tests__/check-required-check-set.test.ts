/**
 * objectui#9422. The merge queue's required-check set lives in GitHub ruleset
 * 11776024 — repository settings, not this repository. Dropping a member from
 * it reds no gate and leaves no trace in any diff, and the one time that state
 * existed here (objectui#3523) three pull requests merged with `Type Check` at
 * `conclusion=failure`.
 *
 * `scripts/check-required-check-set.mjs` is the patrol that reads it. This file
 * holds four separate things, because the patrol has four distinct ways to stop
 * meaning anything:
 *
 *   1. the LOGIC — `--self-test`, offline, including the ablation;
 *   2. the ABLATION through the real CLI, over a COMMITTED fixture of the live
 *      API response with exactly one member removed, against the unablated
 *      fixture as its control. A gate never observed failing is decoration;
 *   3. the DECLARATION's integrity — every name the patrol pins or watches must
 *      also be a name this repository already declares blocking in
 *      `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS`, so the two lists cannot drift into watching
 *      different pipelines;
 *   4. the WIRING — the workflow exists, is scheduled, and runs this script.
 *      A patrol nobody runs is indistinguishable from a patrol that passes,
 *      and this is the half of the patrol's own liveness that a diff can see.
 *
 * ⚠️ What this file deliberately does NOT assert: that the live ruleset is
 * intact. That reading needs the network and belongs to the scheduled run. A
 * test that reached the API would be red whenever GitHub was slow, on every
 * pull request, which is the noise the patrol's whole design avoids.
