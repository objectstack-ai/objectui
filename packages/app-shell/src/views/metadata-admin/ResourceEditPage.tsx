/**
 * MetadataResourceEditPage — generic AutoForm-driven editor (Phase 3c).
 *
 * What it does:
 *   1. Fetches the layered view (`GET /meta/:type/:name/layers`) so the user
 *      sees code vs overlay vs effective.
 *   2. Renders a SchemaForm against the JSONSchema in the type's
 *      `/meta/types` registry row.
 *   3. Save → PUT, with automatic destructive-change handling: a 409
 *      `destructive_change` response opens a confirmation dialog
 *      listing the issues, and on confirm we retry with `?force=true`.
 *   4. Reset overlay → DELETE (overlay only).
 *   5. References tab → calls `client.references()` and lists
 *      back-pointers so admins know what will break before deleting.
 *
 * Works for any of the 27 metadata types — bespoke editors (Object,
 * Field, View, Permission Matrix) opt out by registering a custom
 * EditPage via `registerMetadataResource()`.

 * Normalize the framework's draft envelope into either the draft body or

 *
 *   - `{ type, name, item: {...} }` when a draft exists,
 *   - `{ type, name, label }`       when no draft exists (HTTP 200, item absent).
 *
 * The presence of the `item` key is the single signal; we do NOT fall back
 * to using the envelope itself as the body — doing so would mis-identify the
 * "no draft" stub (which still has `type`/`name`/`label` keys) as a real
 * pending draft and would corrupt the editor baseline.
 *
 * ## The served body is DECORATED, and this is where that stops (objectui#7603)
 *
 * The strict draft branch returns `item: decorateMetadataItem(type, …)`, which
 * attaches `_diagnostics` whenever the type has a registered Zod schema, and
 * `_draft` on the preview-draft branch. The spec calls both a READ-TIME
 * decoration and says a served body "is therefore NOT a valid input to the
 * schema that produced it until these are removed". Every merge site below
 * spreads this body over the layered baseline (`{ ...baseline, ...draftReal }`)
 * and the result reaches the client Zod gate, so the decoration made 14 of the
 * 15 wired types — every one whose schema is `.strict()` — report a body THE
 * SERVER ACCEPTS as `unrecognized_keys`. The layered half is clean
 * (`getMetaItemLayered` serves RAW layers), so the misfire needed a PENDING
 * DRAFT to exist, which is why it stayed invisible.
 *
 * This function is the chokepoint: it is the one place a served draft envelope
 * becomes a body, and all three merge sites (the load effect, the post-save
 * refresh, the post-publish refresh) read it. Stripping here fixes them
 * together and leaves no fourth site to forget.
 *
 * ⛔ Never by loosening a schema, and ⛔ never with a local
 * `['_diagnostics', '_draft']`: the list is the SPEC'S, reached through its own
 * exported helper — the same one `MetadataService.saveFields` uses on the write
 * side — because a second hand-maintained copy goes stale the next time the
 * framework adds a decoration, and a decoration this code does not know to
 * remove is precisely the defect. The ADR-0010 protection envelope (`_lock`,
 * `_provenance`, …) is deliberately NOT on that list: those keys are
 * allowlisted by the closed schemas so provenance survives a re-parse, and this
 * strip leaves them alone.
 *
 * The strip runs AFTER the presence verdict, never before it: what counts as a
 * pending draft is `getDraft`'s answer, and removing our own decorations must
 * not be able to turn a served draft into "no draft".

/**
 * The software-package binding this editor is authoring under, read from the
 * ONE place the save->publish loop states it: `?package=` on the editor URL.
 *
 * ## Why this is a function and not two inline reads
 *
 * Both steps of the loop send this value — `doSave` binds the draft row to the
 * package (`PUT ?package=`), and since objectstack#10354 `doPublish` states the
 * same package on the promotion (`POST .../publish?package=`) so #9612's
 * package-closure narrowing at the runtime publish gate is reachable from an
 * HTTP-driven promotion at all. One value, one spelling, both steps — which
 * means one derivation too. A second inline copy in the publish path would be
 * free to drift from the save path (most easily on the `'all'` fold below),
 * and the two calls would then disagree about which package the edit belongs
 * to while both looking correct in isolation.
 *
 * ## The `'all'` fold
 *
 * `?package=all` is the metadata list's "show everything" scope, NOT a package
 * literally named `all`; the framework's normaliser folds `all` and the empty
 * value together to mean "env-local overlay, no package". Folded here to
 * `undefined` so both callers OMIT the parameter rather than sending it empty.
 * The two are the same to that normaliser today, so this is not a behaviour
 * difference against the current server — omit-when-unbound is simply the
 * shape this door already had, and the loop's two calls must not disagree.
 *
 * Read at call time rather than per render because the editor URL's package
 * scope can move under the component (`setSearchParams`), and the value that
 * must be stated is the one in force when the request is issued.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `ownerPackageId` (the router-read `?package=` used to scope
 * layered/draft READS): that one does not fold `'all'`, so reusing it here
 * would send `package=all` as if it were a package id.

  // ── Why the live client Zod `issues` are NOT a term in this gate ──
  //
  // Two author-time error sources reach this page and only one of them gates
  // Save. The asymmetry is intended; it is recorded here because its absence
  // read as a defect from outside (objectui#6980). The discriminator is
  // whether the SERVER is a backstop for the class:
  //
  //  - Inspector issues (a CEL predicate that does not parse) have none.
  //    objectui#4306 measured a dangling-operator formula saving 200 with a
  //    success toast and publishing as the live field definition, and the
  //    runtime authoring gate reports its findings only as ADVISORY on an
  //    already-SUCCESSFUL save (#4133). The client is the only gate, so it
  //    must block.
  //  - Schema issues DO have one. `saveMetaItem` runs the same contract, and
  //    `doSave` below already maps its refusal (422 / INVALID_METADATA /
  //    INVALID_PAYLOAD) back into these same inline issues. A schema-invalid
  //    draft cannot land, so the live Zod pass is a PREVIEW of the server's
  //    verdict rather than the thing standing between the draft and storage.
  //
  // That leaves only the failure the client can cause by itself: being
  // STRICTER than the server. objectui bundles `@objectstack/spec` on a caret
  // range while the server ships its own copy, so the two skew — and skew in
  // that direction is not hypothetical: objectstack#5316 (stored views
  // carrying the platform's own `isPinned` / `sortOrder`), the `report`
  // `objectName`/`columns` drift pinned by `clientValidation.skew.test.tsx`,
  // and the flow node-type shim are three landed instances. (That third shim
  // has since been retired — the published `FlowNodeSchema.type` is an open
  // string on spec 17.2.0, so the enum mismatch it suppressed can no longer be
  // produced; objectui#6982. The skew CLASS it was an instance of is what this
  // paragraph is about, and that has not gone away.)
  //
  // `clientValidation.ts`'s root-cure covers exactly ONE class of that skew: a
  // TOP-LEVEL required field, absent from the draft, that the live server
  // marks optional (`path.length === 1`). It cannot cover the rest. Measured
  // on the bundled spec 17.2.0, 14 of the 15 wired schemas reject an
  // undeclared key, and `unrecognized_keys` arrives at `path.length` 0 (root)
  // or 2 (e.g. `nodes.0`) — which that filter passes straight through. So a
  // server that gains one authorable key would, under a blocking gate,
  // dead-bolt Save for every author using it, on a draft the server accepts,
  // with no on-screen editor able to take the key back out. That is the same
  // wedge every gate in this family is built to avoid — see the stamp on
  // `blockingReport` below, and its siblings in `ObjectFieldInspector`,
  // `ConditionBuilder` and `ConditionalFormattingEditor`.
  //
  // So schema issues are surfaced loudly — banner, inline field errors,
  // `previewDiagnostics` — and left advisory; the server has the last word.
  // Pinned by `ResourceEditPage.schemaAdvisory.test.tsx`.
  // Blocking author-time issues reported by the scoped inspector (e.g. a CEL
  // formula that does not parse) — Save must refuse them rather than publish a
  // malformed definition (objectui#4306).
  //
  // The count is STAMPED with the selection it describes, so it expires by
  // construction when the selection changes or the inspector unmounts: a

  // ── Is this item a packaged ARTIFACT, or org-authored content? ────────
  // The two-tier authorization model (PR-10d.7) applies a different gate to
  // each: overlaying a code-shipped artifact needs `allowOrgOverride`, while
  // authoring org content needs only `allowRuntimeCreate`. Several call sites
  // below key off the answer, so it is derived ONCE here — the previous two
  // in-place copies are how the two drifted from the server (objectui#4308).
  //
  // A non-null `code` layer is NOT by itself proof of a packaged artifact: it
  // only proves that SOME package tagged the item, and org-authored items
  // carry a package tag too. Two exclusions cover that, and they mirror the
  // server rather than guessing alongside it:
  //
  //   1. `_packageId === 'sys_metadata'` — the save-path sentinel for a
  //      published org item, excluded by the protocol's own
  //      `isArtifactBacked` / `lookupArtifactItem`.
  //   2. `provenance === 'org'` (ADR-0010) — the axis that actually separates
  //      tenant-authored content from code-shipped artifacts. The sentinel in
  //      (1) holds only on the save path: boot-time rehydration of
  //      `sys_metadata` re-registers each row under its REAL package id, so a
  //      tenant's own item reads back with a code-looking `_packageId`. The
  //      framework hit exactly this and fixed it by asking provenance instead
  //      (`isTenantAuthored`, cloud#970) — an app the user had just built went
  //      un-editable at the first kernel rebuild. This page still carried the
  //      pre-cloud#970 spelling, which is objectui#4308: an object published
  //      into a WRITABLE package was mis-tiered as a packaged artifact, so
  //      this pillar alone showed the "provided by an installed package"
  //      lock while Studio treated it as editable and the server accepted the
  //      PUT.
  //
  // The server ships the answer on the layered envelope, so we read it rather
  // than re-deriving package writability from a third source. `provenance`
  // describes `code` here (the server resolves it from `code ?? overlay`, and
  // this branch already requires `code != null`); `undefined` means "no
  // opinion" (older server / unstamped item) and keeps the conservative
  // artifact reading, matching the `lock*` flags below.
  //
  // Deliberately NOT loosened: a genuine code package still reports
  // `provenance: 'package'` and stays read-only here, per the objectui#4036
  // ruling — "a code-defined package is read-only; customize in a writable
  // package" is one rule, and this change only stops it firing on packages
  // that are not code-defined.

  // ── objectui#4886 — ONE verdict decides the reset/delete verb ──────────
  //
  // Which verb the destructive control carries is a server question, and the
  // server already answers it: `resolveLockState` computes
  // `resettable = artifactBacked` and ships it on the layered envelope. This
  // page used to re-derive that answer TWICE, differently — the render side
  // asked `isArtifactItem`, `doReset()` asked `layered?.code != null` — and
  // the two disagree for a published org-own item, whose `code` layer is a
  // rehydrated `sys_metadata` row: the button rendered `Trash2` /
  // "Delete" and then executed the reset branch (refetch, stay on the page)
  // after asking "Reset overlay for …?". A button that said delete, asked
  // reset, and did reset.
  //
  // Honest tri-state. `resettable` is `boolean | undefined`:
  //   • `true`      — a package baseline exists behind the overlay, so
  //                   "Reset overlay" is the truthful verb: peel the overlay,
  //                   the code default remains, stay on the page.
  //   • `false`     — nothing to reset TO. The entry IS its `sys_metadata`
  //                   row, so the DELETE the button issues removes it
  //                   outright: `deleteMetaItem` hard-deletes the row, writes
  //                   a `delete` tombstone, and retires the item's registry
  //                   entry because no layer under it can serve the name. The
  //                   server says so in its own receipt for exactly this
  //                   population — `Deleted <type> '<name>' — it no longer
  //                   exists.`, as against `… reset to artifact default.` for
  //                   the backed one. "Delete" is the honest verb and the
  //                   confirm dialog is the consent gate — the maintainer's
  //                   2026-08-17 ruling on this card.
  //   • `undefined` — the server has NO OPINION (pre-ADR-0010 envelope, or a
  //                   transport that drops the flag). The old
  //                   `layered?.resettable !== false` read collapsed this into
  //                   `true`, i.e. it promised a baseline that may not exist.
  //                   We do not guess in the server's name: fall back to this
  //                   page's own conservative tier (`isArtifactItem`), which
  //                   is exactly what the render side already used before this
  //                   change — so a legacy server keeps its legacy rendering,
  //                   and render + confirm + execute still read ONE value.
