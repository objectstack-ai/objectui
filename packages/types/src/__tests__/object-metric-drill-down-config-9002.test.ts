/**
 * `ObjectMetricDrillDownConfig` refuses `filter` and `mode` by name, and the
 * shared `DrillDownConfig` keeps both (objectui#9002, ruling B: a per-block
 * refusal, not a retirement).
 *
 * A metric is one aggregated number: it has no click event for a drill
 * `filter` to interpolate `${event.*}` against, and no row for `mode` to open
 * as a record. Chart and pivot DO read `filter` (through `computeDrillFilter`)
 * and the data table DOES read `mode`, so the shared type is the control here:
 * narrowing it would take a working member away from three other blocks.
 *
 * ## These assertions are compile-time only
 *
 * Same mechanism as `drill-down-config-declared-keys.test.ts`: the
 * `@ts-expect-error` lines and the `Assert` aliases are judged by
 * `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`, the third leg of this package's `type-check`
 * script. Vitest strips types, so the `expect` at the bottom only keeps this a
 * collected suite. A `@ts-expect-error` line whose error disappears is itself
 * an error (TS2578), which is what makes each refusal below able to fail.
 *
 * The three refusals are one fresh literal per key, and one NON-fresh value:
 * an omitted key is an excess-property error only on a fresh literal, so the
 * widened `DrillDownConfig` handed across is the leg that tells a `?: never`
 * tombstone apart from a plain `Omit`.
