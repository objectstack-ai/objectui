 *
 * `object-grid` — the LEGACY `defaultFilters` leg must reach `$filter` through
 * the same lowering sink as the canonical `filter` key (objectui#4082).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * objectui#4041 converged the declared `filter` key onto `toFilterNode`, the
 * repo's single "last hop before the wire". The legacy branch sitting directly
 * beside it was left assigning byte-for-byte:
 *
 *   if (schemaFilter !== undefined) {
 *     params.$filter = schemaFilter;            // lowered
 *   } else if (schema.defaultFilters) {
 *     params.$filter = schema.defaultFilters;   // NOT lowered
 *   }
 *
 * That made this the one leg on the chain reaching the wire unlowered —
 * `plugin-list`'s `buildEffectiveFilter` and `plugin-view`'s non-grid fetch
 * both already route the same value through `toFilterNode`/`mergeFilterNodes`.
 *
 * `isFilterAST` refuses BOTH shapes this slot carries, so either one sent raw
 * is the `400 INVALID_FILTER` measured against a real backend in
 * objectui#3431:
 *
 *   - the declared `Record<string, any>` (MongoDB-style) — a plain OBJECT
 *     where the wire expects an AST node;
 *   - a `ViewFilterRule[]` — an array of rule OBJECTS, which `plugin-view`
 *     forwards into this slot for an active named view (`ObjectView.tsx`, the
 *     `gridSchema` memo: `defaultFilters: viewFilter || …`).
 *
 * The second one is why this is not purely dormant. The card was filed on "no
 * measured producer", reasoning that `defaultFilters` is not in `object-grid`'s
 * registered `inputs` so an author writing it only draws a save-gate warning.
 * That covers authors, not the framework: `plugin-view`'s README documents
 * `listViews.<name>.filter` as `[{ field, operator, value }, …]`, and the
 * registered `object-view` renderer passes no `renderListView`, so that path
 * falls through to `ObjectGrid` rather than to `ListView`.
 *
 * ## What these tests pin
 *
 * That the legacy slot is lowered — the assertion is `$filter` carrying AST,
 * never merely `$filter` being present, for the same reason the sibling
 * `gridFilterInputSpelling.test.tsx` states: "it arrived" and "it arrived in a
 * shape the server accepts" are different claims, and only the second is worth
 * anything here.
 *
 * And two NEGATIVE CONTROLS, which are the half that would rot silently:
 *
 *   1. the canonical `filter` path is untouched — it still wins over the
 *      legacy slot, and its own lowering / pass-through / empty-fold behaviour
 *      is unchanged;
 *   2. an already-AST value in the legacy slot is NOT lowered a second time.
 *      A sink applied twice is the mirror-image defect of a sink not applied,
 *      and it is what a careless "just wrap it in toFilterNode" would produce.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (prediction recorded BEFORE the run)
 *
 * Restoring the raw assignment (`} else if (schema.defaultFilters) { params.
 * $filter = schema.defaultFilters; }`) was predicted to move exactly three
 * cases and no others:
 *
 *   RED   — the `Record` case (`$filter` arrives as the plain object)
 *   RED   — the `ViewFilterRule[]` case (`$filter` arrives as rule objects)
 *   RED   — the empty-object case (`$filter` arrives as `{}` rather than absent)
 *   GREEN — every already-AST case, both slots: the pre-fix code passed AST
 *           through verbatim too, so a control that MOVED here would mean the
 *           change double-lowers rather than that it works
 *   GREEN — every canonical-`filter` case: the change does not touch that branch
 *
 * "Everything turns red" would have been the wrong outcome, not a stronger
 * one — it would say the controls are not controls. Observed result is
 * recorded on the PR.
