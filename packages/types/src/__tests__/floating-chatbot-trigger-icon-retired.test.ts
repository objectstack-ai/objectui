 * `FloatingChatbotConfig.triggerIcon` is an ADR-0049 RETIREMENT TOMBSTONE
 * (objectui#7654), and — unlike every other tombstone in this package — its
 * refusal is TYPE-LEVEL ONLY. Both halves of that sentence are pinned here.
 *
 * ## What was measured
 *
 * `triggerIcon` was declared `?: string` with `@default 'MessageCircle'` and
 * read by nothing. `FloatingChatbot` destructures six of the interface's seven
 * keys (`position`, `defaultOpen`, `panelWidth`, `panelHeight`, `title`,
 * `triggerSize`) and never this one, and `FloatingChatbotTrigger` takes no icon
 * prop, so the advertised default never rendered. A whole-repo `git grep`
 * census over tracked files, build output excluded, returned the declaration
 * and one historical CHANGELOG line and nothing else; the same pass over
 * `triggerSize` returned ten sites across four files, so the instrument was not
 * blind. It is absent from the `chatbot-floating` registration's `inputs` and
 * from its `defaultProps`, so no designer control offered it and no
 * designer-created node carries it — TypeScript was the only way to reach it.
 *
 * ## Why a tombstone, when the usual reason does not apply
 *
 * The other tombstones here argue from the mirror: an undeclared key is
 * silently STRIPPED by a non-strict `z.object`, so deletion trades one silent
 * no-op for another. That argument needs a mirror, and this key has none (see
 * the runtime section below). The tombstone earns its place on the `tsc`
 * channel alone, measured both ways on the retiring PR's merge-base:
 *
 *   | route      | fresh object literal          | widened (non-fresh) value |
 *   |------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
 *   | deleted    | TS2353 excess-property error  | **compiles CLEAN**        |
 *   | tombstoned | TS2322                        | TS2322                    |
 *
 * Excess-property checking only reaches a FRESH literal, so deleting the key
 * would have left the widened path silently accepting it. The declared `never`
 * makes the assignment itself ill-typed, so freshness stops mattering. That
 * contrast is not prose here — it is pinned live: the `bogusUndeclared` control
 * below IS the "deleted" row, carrying no directive because a key this
 * interface does not declare really does ride the widened path unchallenged.
 *
 * The `@ts-expect-error` directives are REAL enforcement: this package
 * type-checks its tests through `tsconfig.test.json`, so re-widening the
 * declaration fails the build on the unused directive. A green `vitest` run is
 * NOT evidence about them — type assertions are erased before it runs.
