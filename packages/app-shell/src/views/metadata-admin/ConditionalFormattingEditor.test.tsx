   * carry a hand-written literal including `data: {}`, and probed every
   * advertised root with `size(<root>) >= 0`. For `data` that probe hit the

   * `data` named the row: a reading that could not fail, and therefore
   * indistinguishable from one that passed — the exact trap
   * `rowPredicateCanon.ts` documents for `data.*` on a record surface.
   *
   * Writing the bag out by hand is the same defect one level up: a literal
   * cannot disagree with the producer, so it silently absorbs any drift. It had
   * already drifted — the literal omitted `os`, which
   * `buildExpressionScope` really does bind, and an assertion below therefore
   * "proved" `os` unbound. Calling the producer is what makes these readings
   * able to fail: if `buildExpressionScope` gains or loses a root, the closure
   * assertion says so instead of quietly agreeing with itself.
   *
   * ⭐ There is no `app` here, and it could not be put back even by accident:
   * objectui#8155 removed `app` from `ExpressionScopeInput` as well as from the
   * returned bag, so passing one is a COMPILE error (TS2353, "'app' does not
   * exist in type 'ExpressionScopeInput'"). That is a third fence on the same
   * fact, and the only one that holds without the suite being run.
   *
   * ⭐ And no `data`, on the same terms, since objectui#8166 — this block
