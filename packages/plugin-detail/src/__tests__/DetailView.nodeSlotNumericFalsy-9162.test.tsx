/**
 * `record:detail`'s two authored node slots — `header` and `footer` — refuse a
 * numeric-falsy authored value instead of painting it into the DOM
 * (objectui#9162).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists separately from the components one
 *
 * objectui#9162's own probe measured eleven leaking sites in
 * `@object-ui/components`. These two were **census hits, not measurements** —
 * the card's TypeScript census reported them and said so, and the triage
 * ruling made "probe before you change it, and report the reading either way"
 * an acceptance condition. This file is that probe, kept as the pin.
 *
 * **Measured on `origin/main` at `7d6439c4b`, before the repair: both LEAK.**
 * `header: 0` and `footer: 0` each painted the character `0` into the detail
 * surface. So they are the same defect as the eleven, not merely the same
 * shape, and they were repaired with the same guard.
 *
 * ## The instrument
 *
 * `document.body.textContent`, compared against the baseline the same harness
 * produces with the slot omitted. Each slot carries its own LIT CONTROL — the
 * same slot fed `42` must reach the text — so a row cannot go green because
 * the surface stopped rendering. A leak row whose lit control does not fire is
 * NOT MEASURED, ⛔ not clean.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Not a licence to narrow the declaration
 *
 * objectui#7105: node slots relax the RENDERER. `anAuthoredNodeStillRenders`
 * is the live control that the repair did not turn these into objects-only or
 * primitives-only slots.
