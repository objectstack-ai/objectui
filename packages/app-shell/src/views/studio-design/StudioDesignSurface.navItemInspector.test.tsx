/**
 * `StudioNavItemInspector`'s object binding reads the CANONICAL key
 * (objectui#4881).
 *
 * The picker used to read `node.object ?? node.objectName` — the spelling
 * `AppSchema` answers with `unrecognized_keys` FIRST, the spelling it accepts
 * only as the fallback. Backwards: the day a draft carries both keys, the
 * designer shows the author the target the schema refuses.
 *
 * Both halves are pinned here, which is what keeps this from being a test that
 * is green on producing nothing:
 *   - the both-keys draft is REJECTED by `AppSchema` (it can never be saved,
 *     so the ordering is defensive, not a live path), and
 *   - the picker nonetheless shows the CANONICAL target, with both names
 *     present as options so the wrong reading would have shown the other one
 *     rather than an empty select.
 * The third case pins the write side: picking an object emits a nav item that
 * the spec's own `NavigationItemSchema` accepts whole.
