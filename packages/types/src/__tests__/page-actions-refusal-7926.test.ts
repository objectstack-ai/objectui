/**
 * `actions` on a `page` NODE is refused at parse, and `content/docs/guide/layout.md`
 * no longer teaches it (objectui#7926, maintainer ruling 2026-09-09, decision batch
 * #107 item 2 — option A; B "declare + render" and C "docs only" were both refused).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `PageNodeSchema` never declared `actions` and `PageRenderer` never read it, but
 * `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`, so an authored array parsed GREEN and drew
 * NOTHING — and, until objectui#7933 replaced the renderer's hand-maintained
 * destructure with `toDomProps`, it reached the wrapper element as
 * `actions="[object Object],[object Object]"`. Three passages of the layout guide
 * taught exactly that document.
 *
 * ## The two halves, and which file owns which
 *
 * This file owns the CONTRACT half: the key is refused by name, the refusal is
 * TARGETED (the node stays open), and no fence on the guide authors it any more.
 * The RENDER half — "the rewritten passages each draw at least one button" — is
 * `packages/components/src/__tests__/guide-layout-page-buttons-7926.test.tsx`,
 * because it needs the real registry. The ruling names both, and the render one is
 * the load-bearing half: a docs edit that still draws nothing passes this file.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Why NOT `.strict()` on the node
 *
 * The ruling required a CENSUS before the refusal, so a strict node could not take
 * a living key with it. Measured over this tree at `8fda00905`: 91 authored
 * `page`-tagged objects read, 8 sites unreadable (7 elided doc fences, 1 literal
 * with a spread member) — a blind-spot reading, because a zero without one is not
 * a measured zero. On a real `page` NODE only two undeclared keys survive
 * passthrough: `actions` (3 sites, all of them the guide passages this card
 * rewrites) and `breadcrumbs` (1 site, no reader either — its own question, NOT
 * ruled on here; ruled and refused since by objectui#8871 under ADR-0049, whose
 * own census also corrected the "1 site" reading recorded here to THREE — this
 * one read `page`-TAGGED objects and missed two of the guide's `breadcrumbs`
 * passages for two DIFFERENT reasons: one passage's literal does carry
 * `type: 'page'` but sits inside a markdown `typescript` fence the census's
 * `json`-fence reader never visits, and the other is a `json`-fenced fragment
 * that never writes `type` at all). Every other undeclared key the same grep found belongs to a
 * DIFFERENT declaration that merely spells `type: 'page'`: nav items, spec `page`
 * list views, `registerMetadataResource` rows. None of them is parsed by this
 * schema — and `page-app-dashboard-spec-parity.test.ts` PINS the node staying open
 * to unknown renderer props, so `.strict()` would have reddened a living pin.
 * `the refusal is targeted, not a strict node` below is that census as an
 * assertion.
