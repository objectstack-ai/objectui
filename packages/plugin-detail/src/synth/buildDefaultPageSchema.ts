 * `buildDefaultPageSchema` — Pure function that synthesizes a canonical

 *
 * This is the foundation of Track 3 "convergence": once
 * `RecordDetailView` synthesizes a Page schema for the no-assignedPage
 * branch and renders via `<SchemaRenderer>`, the default and custom
 * detail paths share a single rendering pipeline. All Phase D/E/F
 * polish (record-aware header chip, chevron path, flush accordion,
 * discussion slot) then applies to every object's default detail page
 * automatically.

 * Phase G slice 1: pure synthesis only. No runtime wiring yet —

 * once the synthesizer covers enough surface area to reach parity with
 * the existing DetailView output.

  //
  // Skipping only the winner is the intended behaviour. The loser is not the
  // H1 — `getRecordDisplayName` reads this same `declaredNameField` ladder
  // and renders the WINNER's value — so hiding the loser removed an ordinary
  // field and spent a strip slot on a field the heading never shows, which is
  // the class of bug this card is about. It also makes this heuristic branch
  // agree with the DECLARED branch above, which has only ever filtered a
  // single `titleField`: the "#2548 follow-up" note up there claims both
  // branches agree, and until now that was true only for objects declaring
  // one alias.
  //
  // Pinned by "skips only the winner when nameField and displayNameField
  // disagree" in `resolveTitleField.sharedLadder-7287.test.ts`.
  //
  // ⚠️ Ask THE GATE first, then skip. A field skipped as the H1 never reaches
  // the selection loops, so skipping it silently would take the objectui#4914
  // report with it — the author of an object whose only retired-typed field
  // happens to title the record would stop being told, while the strip looked
