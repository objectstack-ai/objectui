 * `button-group.mdx` publishes the shipped surface, in BOTH directions (objectui#6347).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists rather than "the docs gates went green"
 *
 * Nothing in CI reads a component page's `plaintext` interface fence.
 * `check-doc-component-types` reads the `type` STRING LITERALS out of docs code
 * blocks and asks only "does something register this type";
 * `check-doc-snippet-types` compiles `ts`/`tsx` fences and a `plaintext` fence is
 * not one. So a member row in that fence can name any key at all and every gate
 * stays green — the same hole `component-fixture-declared-keys.test.ts` records
 * for catalog fixtures, one surface over. A green CI run on the docs correction
 * this file accompanies would have meant "nothing else broke", NOT "the
 * correction is right".
 *
 * ## What the page taught before, measured on this tree
 *
 * Ten rows disagreed with `packages/types/src/navigation.ts` and its Zod mirror,
 * in BOTH directions — the card had noticed only the first direction:
 *
 *   OVER-stated (documented, never declared):  `ButtonGroupSchema.value`,
 *     `ButtonGroupSchema.selectionMode`, `ButtonGroupButton.value`,
 *     `ButtonGroupButton.icon`; `buttons` spelled REQUIRED against a declared
 *     `buttons?`; `label?` spelled optional against a declared required `label`.
 *   UNDER-stated (declared, never documented): `ButtonGroupButton.variant`,
 *     `.size`, `.onClick`, `.className`; three `variant` members
 *     (`secondary`, `destructive`, `link`) and one `size` member (`icon`).
 *
 * Both directions are one defect class with the sign flipped, which is why this
 * file asserts SET EQUALITY on the component's own members rather than the
 * subset the card enumerated. A one-directional pin is what let the omissions
 * sit beside the corrections through two earlier passes over these pages.
 *
 * ⚠️ `.onClick` is in that UNDER-stated list as HISTORY. objectui#6124 (PR
 * #7339, ruling of 2026-08-30) RETIRED the key: the `button-group` renderer
 * renders each `<Button>` without a click handler and never reads it, so the
 * TypeScript face is now `onClick?: never` and the mirror member is a named
 * refusal, `handlerKeyRefusal('onClick', 'retired', …)`. The page owes the row
 * either way — a refusal arm is still a key of `.shape`, so the set equality
 * above is what forced objectui#7340 to spell the row `never` on the page
 * rather than delete it — but the row must no longer name a callable type.
 * The `onClick` case below therefore reads the mirror's refusal instead of
 * restating `() => void`.
 *
 * ## The authority is the mirror's `.shape`, never parse acceptance
 *
 * `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()` and carries `[key: string]: any`, so an
 * undeclared `selectionMode` PARSES GREEN and type-checks — acceptance cannot
 * tell "declared" from "admitted unexamined" (the reading
 * `undeclared-but-consumed-keys-6150.test.ts` and `object-grid-title-mirrored`
 * established). Membership is therefore read off `.shape`, optionality off each
 * member's own `safeParse(undefined)`, and the enum vocabularies through the
 * shared `enumOptions` reader rather than a hand-copied string list, so this
 * file follows the platform instead of asserting yesterday's vocabulary.
 *
 * ## The two BaseSchema-inherited rows are pinned too, and one of them was wrong
 *
 * The page also documents `disabled` and `className`, which `ButtonGroupSchema`
 * inherits rather than declares. `disabled` was spelled `boolean` against a
 * declared `boolean | string` (`base.ts`; the mirror is
 * `z.union([z.boolean(), z.string()])`, the string limb being the predicate
 * dialect `disabledOn` also carries).
 *
 * That read at first like a repo-wide convention worth leaving alone — 14
 * `content/docs/components/**` pages spelled a component schema's own
 * `disabled` as `boolean`. On the tree this file was written against it was
 * not a convention but an outlier: 13 of those 14 component schemas REDECLARED
 * `disabled?: boolean` themselves, so their pages were right and
 * `ButtonGroupSchema` — which did not redeclare it — was the one page out of
 * step.
 *
 * ⚠️ That 13-of-14 reading is now HISTORY, not a live fact. objectui#7087
 * (maintainer ruling 2026-09-01) removed all 18 narrowings, so NONE of the 14
 * redeclare `disabled` any more and all 14 inherit `boolean | string`; the 13
 * pages that had been right became the stale ones and were corrected by
 * objectui#7239. The reasoning below still holds and is why this file asserts
 * the type TEXT of both inherited rows rather than waving them through as
 * "documented centrally" — only the population it was measured against moved.
 * The assertions in this file are about `ButtonGroupSchema` alone and are
 * unaffected; the 14-page invariant now lives in
 * `component-docs-disabled-inherited-7239.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## `## Selection Mode` is gone because the renderer cannot draw it
 *
 * `packages/components/src/renderers/basic/button-group.tsx` implements no
 * selection behaviour at all — it maps `schema.buttons` to `Button` elements and
 * reads `variant` / `size` / `className` / `label` only. The section's heading
 * promised a capability nothing implements. The renderer half is asserted here
 * too, so that whoever DOES implement selection sees this file go red and knows
 * the page owes a section again; without it, the deletion would read as a
 * permanent verdict rather than a statement about this tree.
 *
 * The two catalog fixtures the section used to render STAY (they are a different
 * verification population, fenced off by PR #6345) and are asserted present.
