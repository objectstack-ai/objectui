 * Console ↔ public contract coverage (ADR-0080, objectui#2953).
 *
 * `PUBLIC_BLOCKS` is the curated contract and AI-authoring vocabulary. What an
 * author (or a model) can actually write is the intersection of that list with
 * what THIS APP registers — and nothing was checking the two against each
 * other. objectui#2953 is what that costs: `getPublicConfigs()` resolved each
 * curated tag through `getConfig()`, which reads loaded registrations only, so
 * every block the console registers via `registerLazy()` fell out of the
 * contract — and out of every `kind:'react'` page's scope — while type-check,
 * lint, build and the whole test suite stayed green.
 *
 * This reads the REAL registration list (`src/register-plugins.ts`, the same
 * module `main.tsx` boots from). A hand-copied list here would reproduce the
 * original failure: it would agree with itself and tell us nothing.
 *
 * The assertions are exact lists rather than "contains", because the failure
 * mode is a SHRINKING contract. `toContain` would sail past a block that
 * silently disappeared; an exact list makes both directions a deliberate edit.

/**
 * ── The DERIVED half: the declared layout containers (objectui#6879) ─────────
 *
 * Everything above this line asserts an EXACT LIST, and that is right for what
 * it guards — a SHRINKING contract, which `toContain` sails past. But an exact
 * list cannot answer the question objectui#6879 was filed about, and the
 * distinction is the whole content of that card:
 *
 *   an exact list goes red when a CURATED type disappears;
 *   nothing went red when a newly minted type never arrived.
 *
 * `box` was minted by the 2026-08-29 ruling as the JSON surface's neutral block
 * container and landed on every declaration face there is — the `BoxSchema`
 * interface, its zod mirror, `SchemaRegistry`, the registration in
 * `@object-ui/components`, a docs page, and 27 catalog fixtures. `PUBLIC_BLOCKS`
 * was the one face it missed, and `EXPECTED_COVERED` above agreed with the
 * roster about the omission, because both are hand-carried. Two hand-carried
 * lists that agree prove only that the same hand wrote both.
 *
 * ⭐ So this half DERIVES its population instead of listing it, and a pin over a
 * derived population fails by ABSENCE. The naive alternative — asserting
 * `PUBLIC_BLOCKS` contains `box` — passes on a roster that carries `box` AND
 * has already missed the type minted after it, which is this same defect one
 * iteration later.
 *
 * THE POPULATION, and why these two readings:
 *
 *   1. `LayoutSchema.options` — the runtime-enumerable zod authoring union in
 *      `@object-ui/types/zod`. It is the JSON layout vocabulary as DECLARED:
 *      a type that has been minted is an arm of it, and a type that has not is
 *      not. Read from the union's own arms, so minting the next one moves this
 *      set with no list here to maintain.
 *   2. `isContainer === true` — the registry's own declared containment
 *      (objectui#3900 / #6740 / #6764). It is what makes the population the one
 *      Tier B's layout primitives live in: `box`'s five curated siblings
 *      (`flex` / `grid` / `stack` / `card` / `container`) are exactly the
 *      objectui#6764 control set, which is what makes this a reading rather
 *      than a broken scan — and it is asserted below rather than assumed.
 *
 * Scope, stated plainly: this covers the CONTAINER half of the layout
 * vocabulary. The non-container arms (`span`, `separator`, `scroll-area`,
 * `resizable`, `page`, the deprecated `div`, and — since objectui#8499 armed
 * them — the 37 flow/inline HTML tags of `HtmlElementSchema`, not one of which
 * declares containment) are outside it because curating any of them is an
 * unruled question of its own, and a ledger is a forcing function, not a place
 * to park four of those at once.
 *
 * ── THE MEASUREMENT THIS CARD WAS DISPATCHED TO MAKE, RECORDED ──────────────
 *
 * Before `box` was added to the roster, triage required an answer to: what does
 * `registry-inputs-spec-parity` (next door) do with a PUBLIC block that has no
 * `@objectstack/spec` entry? Adding it first is how a gate discovers a new
 * population at merge time.
 *
 * The answer is a third one, neither "it demands a spec entry" nor "it tolerates
 * the absence": IT CANNOT SEE THE BLOCK AT ALL. That file's coverage set is
 * SPEC-shaped — `Object.keys(ComponentPropsMap)` filtered to what this repo
 * registers with inputs — and it never reads `PUBLIC_BLOCKS`.
 *
 * ⭐ Membership in this roster is therefore neither NECESSARY nor SUFFICIENT for
 * being judged, and both halves have live specimens, so the measurement is not a
 * story about one block:
 *
 *   - not necessary — `element:record_picker` is absent from `PUBLIC_BLOCKS` and
 *     judged anyway, because the spec describes it (the parity file says so
 *     itself, in its own words about why its coverage is not limited to the
 *     public tier);
 *   - not sufficient — `flex` / `grid` / `stack` / `card` / `container` are all
 *     curated and all unjudged, because `@objectstack/spec@17` carries no entry
 *     for any Tier B layout primitive.
 *
 * So `box` did not arrive as a new spec-less population; it joined one five
 * types deep that the gate has never judged. Both halves are pinned below.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONE THING THIS GAP WAS NOT. "Absent from `PUBLIC_BLOCKS`" never meant "not
 * on an authoring surface", and saying so would overstate the card. `box`'s
 * `inputs` have been live all along through the OTHER consumer of the same
 * metadata: `components/src/renderers/layout/page.tsx` builds the JSX-page
 * compiler's manifest from `getKnownTypes()` — registry-wide, no roster in it —
 * and `validateTree` judges authored pages against that. What this roster gates
 * is `getPublicConfigs()`: the curated AI-authoring vocabulary, and through
 * `sdui-parser/scripts/gen-manifest.ts` the published `sdui.manifest.json` and
 * `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts`. That is the surface `box` was missing from — narrower,
 * and true.

/**

 * builds that scope with `if (!tag || cfg.isContainer) continue;`, so it skips
 * EVERY container config; a ledgered container already carries the flag, so
 * promotion changes which list the config comes from and nothing about whether
 * the loop keeps it. Measured on `main`: 46 injected identifiers today, 46 with
 * `main` promoted, `Main` absent from both. The deletion reading is real but
