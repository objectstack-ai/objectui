/**
 * Where the authoring boundary actually runs for the select-option and
 * multiline-editor keys — pinned so the comments that describe it cannot rot
 * (objectui#7014, re-pointed for `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0).
 *
 * ## What this file was, and what moved
 *
 * objectui#7014 measured three doc comments in `packages/types/src/field-types.ts`
 * that claimed the installed `@objectstack/spec` DECLARED the keys beside them:
 *
 *   "Aligns `@objectstack/spec` `SelectOptionSchema.description`"
 *   "`@objectstack/spec` `FieldSchema.rows` (a positive integer, authorable …)"
 *
 * Against `@objectstack/spec@17.2.0` those claims were false — the spec had no
 * such keys and refused them BY NAME — and a false canonical claim is a planted
 * premise for the next agent, not stale documentation. So this file pinned the
 * BOUNDARY rather than removing anything.
 *
 * ⭐ At `@objectstack/spec` **17.3.0** the boundary MOVED, and it moved to where
 * those original comments said it was. The maintainer's 2026-08-25 ruling on
 * objectui#6140 / objectui#6153 (Option A) declared both keys, and 17.3.0
 * implements it: `SelectOptionSchema.description` and a `rows` gated to the four
 * multiline editor types are now authorable. Re-pointing these assertions
 * EXECUTES that ruling; it does not make a new one.
 *
 * ## The boundary moved, it did not disappear — and that is the point
 *
 * Two of the three keys #7014 measured are now declared. The third is not, and
 * neither are the keys around them. Everything below is written as a PAIR, so
 * this file keeps failing loudly in whichever direction the contract next moves:
 *
 *   - `description` and `rows` are DECLARED, each with a value-level assertion
 *     so "the key is admitted" is not confused with "anything may be written
 *     into it" (a key that were merely tolerated would pass the first and fail
 *     the second).
 *   - `icon` and `disabled` remain OUTSIDE the option vocabulary, refused BY
 *     NAME, and they are the control that proves the schema still refuses
 *     anything at all rather than having gone permissive.
 *   - `rows` is TYPE-GATED: declared on `textarea` / `markdown` / `html` /
 *     `richtext` and refused on the field types that do not take it. "Declared"
 *     does not mean "declared everywhere", and the refusal there arrives as a
 *     cross-field refinement rather than `unrecognized_keys`.
 *   - The four inert rich-text keys (`toolbar` / `preview` / `minHeight` /
 *     `maxHeight`) are STILL undeclared. The ruling's expansion stops at `rows`
 *     (objectui#7635 records this explicitly: ⛔ do not widen), so they are
 *     pinned as refused — that door has to be seen to stay shut.
 *
 * ⚠️ The prose in `packages/types/src/field-types.ts` and
 * `packages/types/src/select-option.ts` still describes the 17.2.0 boundary and
 * is now false in the other direction. Correcting it is objectui#7635's
 * declared surface (the comment/prose sites), not this file's — recorded here
 * so the two halves are not repaired twice or, worse, once.
 *
 * Every assertion pairs its verdict with a CONTROL that changes exactly one
 * thing, so a red here reads "the key's status changed" and never "the fixture
 * drifted".
