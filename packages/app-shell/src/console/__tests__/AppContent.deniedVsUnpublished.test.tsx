/**
 * An app the session may not open must SAY so — not report a deploy state
 * (objectui#4252). And nor must any of the other causes that land here
 * (objectui#9262): this screen now says only what the probe measured.
 *
 * ⚠️ The file name is objectui#4252's. That card split ONE cause — `denied` —
 * off this screen; objectui#9262 split the rest, so what is pinned here is the
 * whole verdict set, not the denied/unpublished pair the name suggests. Renaming
 * would cost the history of the defect this file was written for.
 *
 * ## The measured defect
 *
 * The console reads its app list from the generic metadata list route
 * `GET /api/v1/meta/:type` with the singular type segment `app`, and the server
 * filters that list per session in `filterAppForUser`
 * (`packages/rest/src/rest-server.ts`), so an app withheld by
 * `requiredPermissions` and an app that does not exist were byte-identical to
 * the console: both simply absent
 * from the list. `AppContent`'s `requestedAppMissing` branch therefore rendered
 * its only copy for an absent app — "This app is not available yet — it may
 * still be publishing. Try again in a moment." — over a PERMANENT authorization
 * decision, under a Retry button that can never succeed.
 *
 * The cost was measured on a downstream acceptance round and is not cosmetic:
 * one role hit this screen, another opened the same app fine, and because the
 * copy names a transient deployment state the finding was filed as a platform
 * defect and carried through two test batches. The account was missing a
 * permission-set binding; the gate had been working exactly as designed.
 *
 * ## What made the fix possible, and what it must not become
 *
 * The maintainer ruling (2026-08-12) took the contract-first half first:
 * objectstack#8013 (PR #8135) made the BY-NAME route answer an explicit
 * permission denial, while the LIST route stays filtered exactly as before —
 * no `authorized: false` flag, so the enumeration surface is not widened past
 * what a by-name probe already implies. Measured off that merged diff, the
 * envelope this console consumes is:
 *
 *     403  { success: false, error: { code: 'PERMISSION_DENIED', message } }
 *
 * and absence answers either that 404 or — measured on a real server while
 * implementing objectui#9262 — a `200` carrying the declared envelope MINUS its
 * `item`. So the branch here is on the ADR-0112 **code** and on the envelope,
 * never on the status (the objectui#4408 lesson: a status cannot separate two
 * refusals that share it).
 *
 * ## What objectui#9262 changed, and why the old "must not change" cases moved
 *
 * objectui#4252 left every non-denial on one screen whose copy asserted a
 * transient publish — "it may still be publishing" — for seven distinct causes,
 * one of which is a publish. Those cases used to be pinned HERE as
 * "MUST NOT CHANGE", and they were right to be: at the time, guessing in the
 * other direction would have been the same defect mirrored. The ruling
 * (2026-09-13) retired the guess instead of re-aiming it, so each of them now
 * has a screen that states its own measurement — and the sentence itself is
 * gone from all ten packs, which the last case in this file holds.
 *
 * ⭐ The case named THE MEASURED SHAPE below is objectui#9262 cause 8, and it is
 * the reason this rewrite is not a copy edit. On a real server the by-name route
 * answers `granted` for an app the list does not carry, so a `not_found` branch
 * keyed on a 404 alone would have been dead for the commonest absences and they
 * would have kept falling through to the neutral screen — the card filed that
 * shape as "structural, not observed".
 *
 * ## Why the route is stubbed at the TRANSPORT
 *
 * The adapter is a real `ObjectStackAdapter` over a stubbed `fetch`, so these
 * cases exercise the real client, the real error stamping (`error.code` /
 * `httpStatus` off the envelope) and the real probe. Injecting a verdict into
 * component state instead would assert the branch against a fixture of its own
 * conclusion, and could not see the accessor (`body.error.code`) change.
 *
 * NOTE ON SCOPE: like `AppContent.inaccessibleAppStrand.test.tsx`, this file
 * measures WHICH SURFACE renders. `ConsoleLayout` and the lazy pages are
 * stubbed; none of their internals are part of the question.
