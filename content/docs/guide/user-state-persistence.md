title: "User-Scoped State Persistence"
---

Object UI keeps per-user UI state — **Favorites** (pinned apps, starred records, and pinned navigation entries), **Recent Items** (last visited entities), and **Flow-palette recents** (node types recently added in the flow designer) — alive across reloads, devices, and accounts. The persistence layer is **backend-agnostic**: drop in an adapter, or just let it run on localStorage.

## Design

The shell exposes a small injection contract:

```typescript
export interface UserDataAdapter<T> {
  /** Load the persisted list for the current user. Resolve to [] when absent. */
  load(): Promise<T[]>;
  /** Persist the full list (debounced upstream). Errors are silently ignored. */
  save(items: T[]): Promise<void>;
}

export type UserStateKind = 'favorites' | 'recent' | 'flowPaletteRecents';
```

Three layers, top-down:

| Layer | Package | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Providers** (`FavoritesProvider`, `RecentItemsProvider`, `FlowPaletteRecentsProvider`) | `@object-ui/app-shell` | Own the state, debounce writes, scope storage by user. |
| **Adapter registry** (`UserStateAdaptersProvider`) | `@object-ui/app-shell` | Lets a bridge component inject adapters at runtime once `dataSource` + `user.id` are available. |
| **Adapters** (`createObjectStackUserStateAdapter`, your own) | `@object-ui/data-objectstack`, custom | Translate `load/save` into HTTP / GraphQL / ObjectQL calls. |

### Three guarantees

1. **localStorage-first.** First paint never blocks on the network. If no adapter is attached, persistence is purely local.
2. **Scoped per `user.id`.** Storage key is `objectui-favorites:u:<id>` (and `objectui-recent-items:u:<id>`, `flow-palette-recents:u:<id>`). Two accounts on the same browser never see each other's state.
3. **Silent degrade.** Adapters must never throw. A 404 / network error means "behave like there is no backend"; the UI keeps working from localStorage.

## Provider tree

`ConsoleShell` wires everything up in this order:

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — a provider-tree sketch: the `Suspense` fallback is a literal `{...}` ellipsis and the JSX comments stand in for the components' own props, so the block shows nesting order rather than compiling -->

```tsx
<ThemeProvider>
  <NavigationProvider>
    <UserStateAdaptersProvider>      {/* adapter registry */}
      <FavoritesProvider>            {/* consumes adapter via context */}
        <RecentItemsProvider>
          <Suspense fallback={...}>
            {children /* ConnectedShellInner mounts the bridge */}
          </Suspense>
        </RecentItemsProvider>
      </FavoritesProvider>
    </UserStateAdaptersProvider>
  </NavigationProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

`ConnectedShellInner` mounts a tiny `UserStateBridge` component that calls `useAttachUserStateAdapters()` to plug in adapters once both `user.id` and `dataSource` are ready.

## Using the official ObjectStack adapter

The companion adapter is shipped in `@object-ui/data-objectstack`:

```typescript
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { createObjectStackUserStateAdapter } from '@object-ui/data-objectstack';
import { useAttachUserStateAdapters } from '@object-ui/app-shell';
import { useAuth } from '@object-ui/auth';
import type { DataSource } from '@object-ui/types';

function UserStateBridge({ dataSource }: { dataSource?: DataSource }) {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const attach = useAttachUserStateAdapters();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!user?.id || !dataSource) return;
    const favorites = createObjectStackUserStateAdapter({
      dataSource, userId: user.id, key: 'ui.favorites',
    });
    const recent = createObjectStackUserStateAdapter({
      dataSource, userId: user.id, key: 'ui.recent',
    });
    attach('favorites', favorites);
    attach('recent', recent);
    return () => {
      attach('favorites', null);
      attach('recent', null);
    };
  }, [user?.id, dataSource, attach]);

  return null;
}
```

### Required backend object

The official adapter stores **one row per (user_id, kind) pair** holding the full list as a JSON blob.

```yaml
object: user_app_state
fields:
  - name: user_id
    type: string
    indexed: true
  - name: kind
    type: string
    indexed: true
  - name: payload
    type: json
  - name: updated_at
    type: datetime
unique: [user_id, kind]
```

If this object doesn't exist on your backend, every call simply 404s — the UI keeps running from localStorage. There is no migration to roll out.

### What the adapter does

1. **load()**
   - `find('user_app_state', { filter: { user_id, kind }, limit: 1 })`
   - Parses `payload` (tolerates already-parsed JSON or string-encoded JSON).
   - Caches the returned row id for fast subsequent saves.
   - Any error → returns `[]`.

2. **save(items)**
   - If we have a cached row id → `update('user_app_state', id, { payload, updated_at })`.
   - Otherwise → `find` then `create`.
   - If update fails (e.g. row was deleted server-side) → falls back to create.
   - Any error → resolves silently.

## Writing a custom adapter

```typescript
import type { UserDataAdapter } from '@object-ui/app-shell';
import type { FavoriteItem } from '@object-ui/app-shell';

export function createMyApiAdapter(userId: string): UserDataAdapter<FavoriteItem> {
  const url = `/api/users/${userId}/favorites`;
  return {
    async load() {
      try {
        const res = await fetch(url);
        if (!res.ok) return [];
        return (await res.json()) as FavoriteItem[];
      } catch {
        return [];
      }
    },
    async save(items) {
      try {
        await fetch(url, {
          method: 'PUT',
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
          body: JSON.stringify(items),
        });
      } catch {
        /* silent */
      }
    },
  };
}
```

Plug it in with `attach('favorites', createMyApiAdapter(user.id))`.

## How writes are batched

The providers debounce backend writes with a 500ms window via `createDebouncedFlush`. A burst of mutations (e.g. drag-reordering ten favorites) results in a single `save()` call carrying the final list. The provider flushes pending writes on unmount and on user-change so nothing is lost during navigation.

`localStorage` is written **synchronously** on every mutation, so reloads always show the latest state immediately even if the debounced backend write hasn't fired yet.

## Race-safety

Each provider keeps a monotonic `hydrationToken`. If the user switches accounts while a `load()` is in flight, the late response is discarded. This prevents seeing User A's favorites flash into User B's session.

## Reference

| Symbol | Package | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `UserStateAdaptersProvider` | `@object-ui/app-shell` | Adapter registry; place above the providers. |
| `useAttachUserStateAdapters()` | `@object-ui/app-shell` | Imperative API for a bridge component to attach/detach adapters. |
| `useUserStateAdapter(kind)` | `@object-ui/app-shell` | Read the currently-attached adapter (rarely needed by app code). |
| `useFavorites()` | `@object-ui/app-shell` | `{ favorites, addFavorite, removeFavorite, toggleFavorite, isFavorite, clearFavorites, setPinned, isPinned, pinnedNavIds }` |
| `useNavPins()` | `@object-ui/app-shell` | Thin shim over `useFavorites` for sidebar pinning — `{ pinnedIds, togglePin, isPinned, applyPins, clearPins }`. |
| `useRecentItems()` | `@object-ui/app-shell` | `{ recentItems, addRecentItem, clearRecentItems }` |
| `useFlowPaletteRecents()` | `@object-ui/app-shell` | `{ recents, recordRecent }` — flow-designer add-node MRU; falls back to localStorage outside a provider. |
| `createObjectStackUserStateAdapter(opts)` | `@object-ui/data-objectstack` | Official adapter against the `user_app_state` object. |

## Limits

- **20** favorites and **20** nav-pins per user (independent buckets), **8** recent items, **5** flow-palette recents. Enforced by the providers; older entries roll off within their own bucket without evicting the other.
- One JSON blob per (user, kind). Not designed for high-frequency / large payloads — this is UI state, not data.
- No automatic cross-tab sync today (see the roadmap).

## Unified Favorites + Nav Pins

The left-sidebar "Pin" feature and the object-page top-right "Favorite" are stored in the **same** `favorites` collection. A `FavoriteItem` now carries three optional fields used by the navigation pin flow:

```ts
interface FavoriteItem {
  id: string;            // 'nav:<navId>' for nav pins, '<objectName>:<recordId>' for records, etc.
  type?: 'object' | 'record' | 'view' | 'page' | 'nav';
  pinned?: boolean;      // true => render in the sidebar Pinned section
  navId?: string;        // back-reference to the original NavigationItem.id
  // …plus existing fields: label, href, icon, addedAt, …
}
```

- **One source of truth, one server roundtrip.** Both flows write through the same `UserDataAdapter<FavoriteItem>` (`kind: 'favorites'`).
- **Cross-device sync.** Pinning a sidebar item on the desktop shows up in the same place on mobile, behind the same backend that already syncs Favorites.
- **Bucketed caps.** Content favorites and nav pins each have an independent cap of 20 — migrating sidebar pins never evicts starred records.
- **Legacy migration (one-shot).** The old `objectui-nav-pins` localStorage key (a plain `string[]`) is read once on first mount, converted to `type:'nav'` favorites with `pinned: true`, then removed. If an adapter is attached, the migrated set is also pushed to the backend on the next debounce window.

UIs that surface "favorites" (HomePage Starred, the sidebar Favorites section) filter out `type === 'nav'` so nav-pin records don't pollute the user-visible list. The sidebar Pinned section is rendered from the live navigation tree decorated by `useNavPins.applyPins`.

## Record-overlay width

The record overlay — the panel that opens when a user clicks a row, node, bar,
card or event — remembers the width that user dragged it to. This is a
**preference**, not addressable state, so it lives in `localStorage` rather than
in the URL.

| Key | Written by | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `ov:drawer-width:<objectName>` | `NavigationOverlay` (`@object-ui/components`) | An integer pixel width |

One key per object, shared by every view type: resize the overlay on a grid and
the same object's kanban board opens at that width too.

- **Floor and ceiling.** Widths below 360px are not restored (the panel body
  stops being usable); a drag is capped at 95% of the viewport.
- **Reset.** Double-clicking the drag handle removes the key, so the overlay
  returns to the width the metadata authored.
- **Legacy migration (one-shot).** Until objectui#9299 the gantt, kanban and
  calendar drawers ran a second implementation of their own that persisted to
  `objectui.drawerWidth.<objectName>` with a 480px floor. The first mount that
  finds no value under the current key reads that one, writes it forward, and
  **removes** the retired entry — so a width a user had already chosen carries
  over rather than resetting, and a later double-click reset is not undone by a
  stale value coming back.

Authoring note: the mode the overlay opens in is `navigation.mode` on the view
(`drawer` | `modal` | `split` | `popover`), and it means the same thing on every
list-type renderer. In `split` the renderer's own view moves into the left
panel; in `popover` the panel is anchored to the element the user clicked.
