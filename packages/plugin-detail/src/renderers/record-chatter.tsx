 *
 * `record:chatter` / `record:discussion` — Salesforce-style social feed for
 * the current record. The renderer is a thin wrapper around
 * `RecordChatterPanel`; it pulls feed items + mutation handlers from the
 * surrounding `DiscussionContext` (mounted by `RecordDetailView` or any
 * other host shell that owns the feed). When no DiscussionContext is
 * present the panel renders an empty feed so the page still composes
 * correctly in standalone previews.
 *
 * ## `feed` is the full `record:activity` shape, and it is applied HERE
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` declares `RecordChatterProps.feed:
 * RecordActivityProps.optional()` (`ui/component.zod.ts`, the member commented
 * `Feed configuration (delegates to RecordActivityProps)`), bound to BOTH names
 * — `ComponentPropsMap` wires `'record:chatter'` and `'record:discussion'` to
 * that one `RecordChatterProps` row, and the pair-identity pin in
 * `component-record-blocks.test.ts` holds them together. And
 * `RecordActivityProps` carries the filter members `types` / `limit` /
 * `showCompleted` / `unifiedTimeline`. This renderer used to hand
 * `discussion.items` to the panel raw, so those four were accepted by the spec,
 * declared in the registration, and then discarded in silence — an
 * IMPLEMENTATION GAP, not a narrower contract (objectui#8934).
 *
 * The pipeline below is `record-activity.tsx`'s, not a second convention: the
 * same `applyFeedConfig(sourceItems, { types, showCompleted, unifiedTimeline },
 * pageSize)` call, and the same reading of `limit` as a PAGE SIZE that
 * "Load more" grows by, rather than a hard cap.
 *
 * ⚠️ Consequences an author sees, because the spec's DEFAULTS now apply here
 * too: `showCompleted` defaults false, so completed activities (feed type
 * `task`) are hidden unless asked for; and an unauthored `limit` is
 * `DEFAULT_ACTIVITY_LIMIT` (20), so a longer feed pages instead of rendering
 * whole. Both are `record:activity`'s behaviour, which is what the protocol
 * says this key is.
 *
 * ## `filterMode` and `enableMentions` — the remainder, closed here (objectui#8968)
 *
 * `applyFeedConfig` is the filter PIPELINE, so it reaches the four members it
 * takes and no others. Two more members of the same declared shape sit outside
 * it, and both were still unread on this path after objectui#8934:
 *
 *   `filterMode`      `RecordActivityTimeline` takes it as a component PROP
 *                     (destructured `filterMode: controlledFilter`, resolved as
 *                     `controlledFilter ?? internalFilter`), never off `config`
 *                     — and this renderer passed none, so an authored
 *                     `feed.filterMode` reached nothing under either name.
 *                     `RecordChatterPanel` already declares and forwards the
 *                     prop; the chatter renderer was the missing end.
 *   `enableMentions`  the composer's @-autocomplete is fed by
 *                     `mentionSuggestions`, which this renderer passed on
 *                     UNCONDITIONALLY — so the affordance existed here and the
 *                     member the protocol says gates it did not. Off now
 *                     withholds the suggestions, which is the behaviour the
 *                     `record:activity` registration publishes for this key.
 *
 * Both are wired with `record:activity`'s own reading rather than a local one,
 * for the reason objectui#8934 gives: one declared shape, one implementation of
 * it, not two copies kept in agreement by hand.
 *
 * ### ⭐ The DECISION this card left to the implementer — `filterMode` on a
 * panel whose dropdown is gated off by `showFilterToggle`
 *
 * `filterMode` and `showFilterToggle` are INDEPENDENT. One names WHICH SLICE
 * the feed shows; the other names WHETHER THE CONTROL that changes it is on
 * screen. With the toggle off an authored `filterMode` is therefore not inert —
 * it stops being the slice the user OPENS on and becomes the slice the author
 * PINNED. Three reasons that is the reading, rather than "no dropdown, no
 * meaning":
 *
 *   1. the protocol's own wording splits them exactly that way — `filterMode`
 *      is described as the "Default activity filter" and `showFilterToggle` as
 *      "Show filter dropdown in panel header". Neither member's description
 *      mentions the other, so neither is declared to gate the other.
 *   2. `RecordActivityTimeline` already resolves `activeFilter` before, and
 *      independently of, its `showFilter` flag, and the item filter runs on
 *      `activeFilter` whether or not the dropdown renders. Coupling the two
 *      HERE would put a second convention on one declared shape — the defect
 *      class objectui#8934 closed, re-opened one key along.
 *   3. the alternative silently discards a value the author wrote and the spec
 *      accepts, which is the exact shape this card exists to remove.
 *
 * Pinned by `__tests__/recordChatterFilterModeMentions-8968.test.tsx`, both
 * legs: the pinned slice renders, and the dropdown does not.
 *
 * ⚠️ `aria` — the third row of objectui#8968's table, which the card filed as
 * NOT MEASURED — was measured on that card and is NOT part of this path's
 * remainder: it is unread on `record:activity` as well, so it is a gap over the
 * `record:*` block family rather than a chatter-path one, and closing it means
 * deciding how an authored label composes with the timeline's own. Reported on
 * objectui#8968, deliberately not fixed here. ⚠️ Nothing in this file
 * re-derives that reading — it was taken once, and the card carries it.

  // ⭐ These defaults are the WHOLE of what the host's auto-appended discussion

  // schema (`@object-ui/app-shell` `RecordDetailView.tsx`, the

  // `RecordChatterPanel` with raw rows. So the two chatter surfaces on a record
  // page render the same feed again, and they do it by running one pipeline
  // rather than by keeping two copies of it in agreement.
  //
  // ⚠️ The history is worth keeping because it is the failure this file is one
  // half of. This comment once said an author-placed `record:discussion` "looks
  // identical to the fallback the host injects when no component is present".

  // measured on the same feed, three comments plus one `task` row rendered four
  // rows through the fallback and three here, and twenty-five comments rendered
  // twenty-five there and twenty plus a "Load more" here. objectui#8983 closed
  // it at the BINDING, not by teaching the fallback its own copy of the filter
  // logic. ⛔ A future edit that gives the fallback its own items/config path
  // re-opens the divergence — `RecordDetailView.discussionFallbackPipeline-8983`

  // once per offending VALUE, so a bad `filterMode` authored on both a
  // `record:activity` and a `record:chatter` block on one page warns under the
  // activity name only. A renderer-aware prefix belongs in `recordActivityFeed`
