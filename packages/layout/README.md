## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @object-ui/layout
```

**Peer Dependencies:**
- `react` ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0
- `react-dom` ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0
- `react-router-dom` ^6.0.0 || ^7.0.0

## Registration

Importing this package registers its component keys (`page-header`, `page:card`,
`responsive-grid`, `navigation-renderer`, `app-schema-renderer`) on the
`ComponentRegistry` as a module load side effect, so the side-effect-only import
is enough:

```typescript
import '@object-ui/layout';
```

That is a supported entry point, not an accident of the build: `package.json`
declares the registering modules in `sideEffects`, which is what stops a bundler
from tree-shaking a side-effect-only import away (objectui#3899 — the manifest
used to say `"sideEffects": false`, and a bundler honouring it dropped the
registration silently). `registerLayout()` is also exported for hosts that
prefer to register explicitly.

## Components

### AppShell

Complete application shell with a top navbar, a sidebar, and a main content area.

```typescript
import { AppShell } from '@object-ui/layout';

<AppShell
  navbar={<div>Navbar Content</div>}
  sidebar={<div>Sidebar Content</div>}
>
  <div>Main Content</div>
</AppShell>
```

The top bar's content goes in `navbar`. `AppShell` renders the `<header>`
element itself (`src/AppShell.tsx:248`) and `{navbar}` is the only thing that
fills it (`:249`) — there is no `header` prop. This example used to pass one
(objectui#4817), and because the component destructures a fixed key list with
**no rest element** (`:233-241`), the node was built and then dropped on the
floor: copied verbatim, the snippet rendered an empty top bar and said nothing.

Like `SidebarNav` below, `AppShell` is composed in JSX and is **not** on the
`ComponentRegistry`: four of its seven props are `React.ReactNode` slots that no
JSON document can fill, so the `app-shell` key was retired in objectui#4841 and
`{ "type": "app-shell" }` now reports `Unknown component type`. When the whole
shell has to come from metadata, the key for that is `app-schema-renderer`.

#### `AppShellProps`

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode` | — (required) | Main content, rendered inside the `<main>` element. |
| `navbar` | `React.ReactNode` | — | Top bar content. `AppShell` supplies the sticky `<header>` around it, so pass only what goes inside. |
| `sidebar` | `React.ReactNode` | — | Left sidebar node, rendered as a flex sibling of the content. Pass `SidebarNav`, or your own node. |
| `rightRail` | `React.ReactNode` | — | Optional right-side rail. It reflows the content beside it rather than overlaying it (ADR-0057 P3a); absent → unchanged single-pane layout. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Tailwind overrides for the `<main>` content element — **not** for the outer container. |
| `defaultOpen` | `boolean` | `true` | Initial open state of the underlying Shadcn `SidebarProvider`. |
| `branding` | `AppShellBranding` | — | App branding, applied by `useAppShellBranding`: `primaryColor` / `accentColor` become CSS custom properties on the document root (re-derived for dark mode), `favicon` sets the icon link's `href`, and `title` sets `document.title`. |

### PageHeader

Page title block with an optional subtitle, used at the top of a page's
content area.

```typescript
import { PageHeader } from '@object-ui/layout';

<PageHeader title="Dashboard" subtitle="View your metrics" />
```

`subtitle` is the only spelling for the secondary line — it is the key
`@objectstack/spec/ui`'s `PageHeaderProps` declares. The legacy `description`
alias this component used to read as well was retired in objectui#3789; stored
metadata still carrying it is rewritten to `subtitle` at load time by the
ADR-0087 D2 conversion `page-header-subtitle-alias`.

> **Rendering a whole `page` node?** That belongs to `PageRenderer` in
> `@object-ui/components`, which is what the `page` component key resolves to —
> it handles page types (record/home/app/utility), named regions and page
> variables. This package deliberately does not register or export a second
> renderer for that key (objectui#3223).

### SidebarNav

Navigation sidebar component with React Router integration.

`NavigationRenderer` also exports `resolveActiveNavTrail`. Given the same
navigation items, route, base path, and template context used to create links,
it returns the active item together with every ancestor group. App shells use
this inverse mapping to keep deep-linked routes aligned with their declared
navigation hierarchy. Authored query parameters participate in the inverse
mapping, so entries that intentionally reuse one page can still identify their
own navigation trail.

```typescript
import { SidebarNav, type NavItem } from '@object-ui/layout';
import { Home, Settings, Users } from 'lucide-react';

const navItems: NavItem[] = [
  { title: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard', icon: Home },
  { title: 'Users', href: '/users', icon: Users },
  { title: 'Settings', href: '/settings', icon: Settings },
];

<SidebarNav items={navItems} />
```

An item's label is `title` and its target is `href` — and `icon` is a **component**,
not an icon name: it is rendered as `<item.icon />` (`src/SidebarNav.tsx:60`, `:109`),
so pass the imported Lucide component itself. This example used to be written with
`label` / `path` / `icon: 'home'`, none of which `NavItem` declares (objectui#3999);
copied as-is it produced rows with no label at all, a `NavLink` whose `to` was
`undefined`, and the string `'home'` handed to React as an unknown lowercase tag.
Annotating the array as `NavItem[]` is what turns that whole class of typo back into
a compile error where it is written, instead of a blank sidebar at runtime.

#### `SidebarNavProps`

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `items` | `NavItem[] \| NavGroup[]` | — (required) | Flat item list, or grouped sections. The array must be homogeneous: only the **first** element is probed to decide which of the two it is. |
| `title` | `string` | `'Application'` | Section label shown above a flat `NavItem[]`. Ignored when `items` is a `NavGroup[]` — each group prints its own `label`. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Tailwind overrides, forwarded to the root `Sidebar`. |
| `collapsible` | `'offcanvas' \| 'icon' \| 'none'` | `'icon'` | Collapse behaviour of the underlying Shadcn `Sidebar`. |
| `searchEnabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Renders a search box that filters items by `title` (an item also survives when one of its `children` matches). |
| `searchPlaceholder` | `string` | `'Search…'` | Placeholder for that search box. |

#### `NavItem`

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | `string` | — (required) | The visible label, and what search matches against. |
| `href` | `string` | — (required) | `NavLink` target; also the React key, so keep it unique within its list. Active state is `pathname === href`. |
| `icon` | `React.ComponentType<{ className?: string }>` | — | The icon **component** (e.g. `Home` from `lucide-react`), not its name. |
| `badge` | `string \| number` | — | Trailing badge content. Rendered whenever it is not `null`/`undefined`, so `0` shows. |
| `badgeVariant` | `'default' \| 'destructive' \| 'outline'` | `'default'` | Badge styling. |
| `children` | `NavItem[]` | — | Nested sub-items. A non-empty list turns the row into a collapsible group: the parent's own `href` is then no longer a link, only the children are. |

#### `NavGroup`

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `label` | `string` | Section heading printed above the group. |
| `items` | `NavItem[]` | The group's items — same `NavItem` shape as above, nesting included. |

```typescript
import { SidebarNav, type NavGroup } from '@object-ui/layout';
import { FolderOpen, Home, Settings } from 'lucide-react';

const navGroups: NavGroup[] = [
  {
    label: 'Workspace',
    items: [
      { title: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard', icon: Home },
      {
        title: 'Projects',
        href: '/projects',
        icon: FolderOpen,
        badge: 3,
        children: [
          { title: 'Active', href: '/projects/active' },
          { title: 'Archived', href: '/projects/archived', badge: 'WIP', badgeVariant: 'outline' },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    label: 'System',
    items: [{ title: 'Settings', href: '/settings', icon: Settings }],
  },
];

<SidebarNav items={navGroups} searchEnabled />
```

Note that `SidebarNav` is a plain React component: unlike the keys listed under
[Registration](#registration) it is **not** on the `ComponentRegistry`, so it is
composed in JSX rather than authored as a JSON node. Full guide:
[SidebarNav docs](https://www.objectui.org/docs/layout/sidebar-nav).

## Usage with React Router

The layout components are designed to work seamlessly with React Router:

```typescript
import type { ComponentType, ReactNode } from 'react';
import { AppShell, SidebarNav } from '@object-ui/layout';
import { Home, Users } from 'lucide-react';

// `react-router-dom` is a PEER dependency (see Installation above): your app
// installs it, this package does not. These three stand in for what you would
// import from it, so the composition below is still checked against the shipped
// `@object-ui/layout` types.
declare const BrowserRouter: ComponentType<{ children?: ReactNode }>;
declare const Routes: ComponentType<{ children?: ReactNode }>;
declare const Route: ComponentType<{ path: string; element: ReactNode }>;

// Your own page components, one per route.
declare const Dashboard: ComponentType;
declare const UsersPage: ComponentType;

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <AppShell
        navbar={<div className="p-4">My App</div>}
        sidebar={
          <SidebarNav
            items={[
              { title: 'Dashboard', href: '/', icon: Home },
              { title: 'Users', href: '/users', icon: Users },
            ]}
          />
        }
      >
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Dashboard />} />
          <Route path="/users" element={<UsersPage />} />
        </Routes>
      </AppShell>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

A route's `element` takes **your page component**, never the `lucide-react` icon
of the same name. This example used to route `/users` to `Users` — the icon it
imports for the sidebar — so the page rendered a 24-pixel glyph where its content
belonged. Nothing catches that for you: an icon is a valid component, so the
route type-checks either way, which is why the two are named apart here.

## Customization

`AppShell` takes a single `className`, and it lands on the `<main>` content
element (`src/AppShell.tsx:256`) rather than on the outer container. There is no
per-slot `headerClassName` / `sidebarClassName` — the navbar and the sidebar are
nodes **you** build, so style them where you build them:

```typescript
import { AppShell } from '@object-ui/layout';

<AppShell
  className="bg-gray-50"
  navbar={<div className="border-b px-4">My App</div>}
  sidebar={<div className="bg-white shadow-lg">Sidebar Content</div>}
>
  <div>Main Content</div>
</AppShell>
```
