/**
 * Reverse i18n sweep (objectui#4658): declared key set MINUS referenced key set.
 *
 * TWO corpora, one question, one report — `sweep()` over the ten locale packs
 * (objectui#4658), and `sweepDesignerTable()` over the metadata-admin
 * designer's module-local `ENGINE_STRINGS_*` table (objectui#8388). They are
 * one script because they ask the same mirror question from the same side, not
 * because they share a walker: the pack half reads the call-site gate's own
 * AST pass, the designer half has its own, because no call-site walker in this
 * repo can see the designer table at all. That second corpus, why it needs a
 * separate leg and what its legs are blind to, is documented at
 * `DESIGNER_TABLE` below rather than here.
 *
 * `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` (objectui#3530) answers "does the key
 * a component ASKS FOR exist in `en`?" — call site -> pack. This file asks the
 * mirror question: "does a key the pack DEFINES have any call site at all?" —
 * pack -> call site. Ten packs identically defining a key nobody asks for is
 * full `all-locales-key-parity`, so that gate cannot see this class either; see
 * that gate's own header for the full five-gate division of labour this is the
 * sixth member of.
 *
 * REPORT-ONLY BY DEFAULT — exit 0 whatever it finds, `--strict` makes a
 * non-empty CONFIRMED list exit 1. Not wired into any CI workflow: a reverse
 * sweep over free-form dynamic-key construction is structurally capable of
 * false positives (a key referenced only through an indirect variable, a
 * template head this parser cannot read, a consumer outside `packages/`+`apps/`),
 * and a gate that cries wolf gets deleted rather than trusted (objectui#4658's
 * own dispatch ruling). This script exists to PRODUCE the candidate list and
 * measure how often it is wrong — see the PR body for that measurement — not to
 * enforce anything today.
 *
 * ## Reuses check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs's OWN walk, not a second parser
 *
 * `collectEnKeys()` supplies the pack side (`leaves` — every dotted key path,
 * assumed identical across all ten packs, which is what
 * `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` separately enforces; this script reads only
 * `en`, matching that gate's own premise).
 *
 * `analyze()` supplies the call-site side. It was extended (not duplicated) to
 * also collect, during the SAME AST walk that already classifies every `t()`/
 * `tt()` call as PACK/LOCAL/OTHER and reads its literal key(s):
 *
 *   - `referencedKeys`  — every literal key any PACK call site asks for, PLUS
 *     every plural-suffixed spelling (`key + '_one'`, `+ '_other'`, …) so a
 *     base key that resolves through a suffix does not read as unreferenced.
 *   - `referencedBranches` — every key consumed WHOLESALE via
 *     `t(key, { returnObjects: true })`; every leaf under such a branch is
 *     live, not just the branch key itself.
 *   - `dynamicHeads` — the static HEAD of every template-built key
 *     (`` t(`marketplace.category.${c}`) `` -> `'marketplace.category.'`).
 *     Any pack leaf sharing that prefix is a POSSIBLE runtime target of the
 *     substitution, so it counts as live. This is the call-site gate's own
 *     `missing-prefix` class read in reverse: there "a substitution could hit
 *     a key nothing defines" is the defect; here "a substitution could hit
 *     this key" is exactly why the key must NOT be called dead. Deliberately
 *     recall-over-precision — a namespace nothing dynamically reaches costs
 *     nothing extra to keep live, and marking it dead when it is not would be
 *     the wrong direction to be wrong in for a deletion sweep. Since
 *     objectui#7592 a head also arrives from a KEY BUILDER — a helper whose
 *     whole body returns one template literal — so a module that builds the key
 *     and hands it to a translator it received as a VALUE (no `t()` call in it
 *     at all, therefore invisible to every leg here at once) now marks its
 *     family live. See that gate's header, "Key-building helpers".
 *
 * A key not covered by any of the three is a CANDIDATE. Two things this
 * mechanism does NOT see, both false-positive sources by construction, both
 * closed by the text safety net below rather than by widening the AST walk:
 *
 *   1. `collectSourceFiles()` (reused unchanged) walks only `packages/` and
 *      `apps/` — same scope as the call-site gate. `examples/` and `e2e/` are
 *      OUT of scope for the AST pass. Measured on this run (see the PR body):
 *      neither directory contains a single `t(`/`tt(` call site today, so the
 *      gap is provably empty right now — but it is a gap, not a guarantee, and
 *      a future example app or e2e helper that starts calling `t()` would
 *      widen it silently. Flagged rather than fixed: matching the call-site
 *      gate's own scope is what makes the two directions comparable, and
 *      widening the walk is a decision for that gate first (its false-positive
 *      cost — `examples/`/`e2e/` code is not what it audits today — is not
 *      this script's to accept unilaterally).
 *   2. A key referenced only INDIRECTLY — assigned to a variable/object
 *      property elsewhere in source (`{ i18nKey: 'console.objectView.new' }`)
 *      and passed to `t()` through that variable rather than as a literal
 *      argument. `literalKeysOf()` (and therefore `referencedKeys`) only reads
 *      the call's OWN argument; a key that reaches `t()` this way is invisible
 *      to the AST pass and would misreport as a candidate.
 *
 * ## The text safety net
 *
 * For every AST candidate, `textFootprint()` greps the WHOLE repository
 * (`packages/`, `apps/`, `examples/`, `e2e/`, `content/`, `scripts/` — everything
 * except the standard build/dep noise and the locale packs themselves, which by
 * definition contain every candidate's defining line and would make every
 * candidate "referenced") for the literal dotted key string, counting an
 * occurrence only where the key stands ALONE — bounded on both sides by a
 * character that cannot continue a dotted key (`occursAtKeyBoundary()`), so a
 * longer key that merely contains this one is not read as evidence about it.
 * A hit means the key's own spelling appears somewhere the AST pass does not look —
 * closing gap 1 (an `examples/`/`e2e/` call site would spell the key as a plain
 * string there too) and softening gap 2 (an `i18nKey: 'console.objectView.new'`
 * property literal IS a plain-text occurrence of the key, even though it is not
 * an argument of `t()`).
 *
 *   - CONFIRMED — no call site (AST) and no bounded textual occurrence of the
 *     key anywhere else in the repo. The tier with the MOST EVIDENCE, which is not the same claim as
 *     the safest to delete: what it does and does not guarantee is written out
 *     under "What CONFIRMED does NOT guarantee" below rather than left to the
 *     word "strongest". Sample-verifying before deleting (objectui#4658's own
 *     dispatch ruling) is a standing requirement, not a transitional one.
 *   - NEEDS-REVIEW — no call site, but the whole key appears somewhere
 *     (a comment, a doc, a fixture, an indirect `i18nKey:`-style property). The
 *     candidate might still be genuinely dead; the hit just means a human has to
 *     look at it before deleting, which is exactly what "AST-dead" alone cannot
 *     tell you.
 *
 * ## The property-chain leg (objectui#6666)
 *
 * The full-key probe above has a blind spot with a name. A consumer that
 * imports a locale PACK OBJECT and reads it by property access never spells
 * the dotted key at all: the namespace segment is bound to a local variable,
 * so the source says `myPack.someGroup.someLeaf` where the pack key is
 * `topNamespace.someGroup.someLeaf`. The AST pass sees nothing either — there
 * is no `t()`/`tt()` call to classify. Both legs are blind at once, and the
 * key lands in CONFIRMED — the top tier — while a shipping screen renders it. (That example is synthetic on purpose;
 * naming a real key here would make this file a textual hit for it — same
 * trap `textFootprint()`'s own note below records.)
 *
 * So alongside the full dotted key, `textFootprint()` also probes the key's
 * PROPERTY CHAIN: the key minus its leading namespace segment, leading dot
 * kept (`propertyChainProbe()`). That is precisely the text a property-access
 * reader DOES spell, whatever it named the variable holding the pack.
 *
 * Three boundaries, each load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. THREE SEGMENTS OR MORE, never two. A two-segment key's chain is a
 *      single word (`.ok`, `.no`, `.empty`) that matches far too much to be
 *      evidence of anything, and demoting on it would hollow out the top tier
 *      instead of correcting it. `propertyChainProbe()` returns `null` below
 *      three segments, so the leg does not apply there at all. For two-segment
 *      keys the sound check is the enumerated importer list below, read by
 *      hand — which is what objectui#6662 used.
 *   2. The match must END at a property boundary: the next character may not
 *      continue an identifier. Without it a chain would also match a LONGER
 *      sibling leaf it merely prefixes, demoting a key on evidence about a
 *      different one.
 *   3. Recall over precision where the two still collide — the same direction
 *      `dynamicHeads` above is deliberately wrong in. Two keys under different
 *      namespaces can share a chain, so a reader of one demotes both. For a
 *      DELETION sweep that is the right way to be wrong. To keep that from
 *      reading as a lie, a hit found ONLY by this probe is reported with a
 *      ` (via property chain)` suffix: the human reading the report then looks
 *      for a property access instead of grepping the dotted key, finding
 *      nothing, and concluding the tool is broken.
 *
 * ## The pack-object importers, enumerated (objectui#6666, objectui#8752)
 *
 * The leg is only as good as the class it covers, so the class is written down
 * rather than left to memory. Re-derive it — the specifier is kept off the
 * `from '...'` shape here on purpose, so this comment is not itself read as an
 * import edge:
 *
 *   grep -rn --include=*.ts --include=*.tsx -E \
 *     "import \{[^}]*\b(en|zh|builtInLocales|getLoadedBuiltInLocales|ja|ko|de|fr|es|pt|ru|ar)\b[^}]*\}" \
 *     packages apps examples e2e \
 *     | grep "@object-ui/i18n" | grep -v '^packages/i18n/'
 *
 * ⭐ `getLoadedBuiltInLocales` joined that alternation with objectui#7479, and
 * the reason is the whole point of deriving the population rather than listing
 * it. That card made nine of the ten catalogues lazy, so a module that holds a
 * pack OBJECT and indexes into it no longer has to NAME a pack in its import —
 * it asks the registry for whatever is resident. `outboundAgentText.ts` is
 * exactly that module and it changed in precisely that way: same dynamic
 * `ai?.[key]` read, same four keys kept alive, and it fell straight out of a
 * derivation keyed on pack NAMES. ⇒ the class this leg covers is "reaches a
 * pack object and indexes into it", ⛔ never "writes a pack's name in an
 * import"; a widening here is the correct response to a new way of reaching
 * one, and a bullet quietly disappearing is not.
 *
 * NO MATCH COUNT IS STATED IN THIS SECTION, and the absence is the fix rather
 * than an omission (objectui#8752). It used to open with one — "19 matches
 * today, of which these four" — written true and then decayed in place: 19 in
 * the comment, 28 when the drift was filed, 31 when it was corrected. A stale
 * total is worse here than no total, and worse for a reason specific to this
 * section: it ships the command to re-derive itself, so a number a reader
 * trusts is a re-derivation that never happens. The population is now DERIVED
 * on every run by `derivePackObjectImporters()` below, which executes exactly
 * the pipeline above and reports the split; the CLI prints it, so the only
 * count anyone reads is one that cannot be older than the run.
 *
 * The BULLETS stay hand-written, and that is not a half-measure. Each says what
 * its importer's SHAPE means for this leg — covered by design, covered by luck,
 * nothing at risk — which is a reading, not a population, and no derivation can
 * produce it. Derived and read are pinned TO EACH OTHER instead:
 * `ANALYSED_PACK_OBJECT_IMPORTERS` below lists exactly the paths these bullets
 * analyse, and `scripts/__tests__/check-i18n-dead-keys.test.ts` fails when the
 * derived non-test set and that list disagree in either direction. A sixth
 * importer therefore turns a test red instead of joining the silence, which is
 * the failure this section had: not a wrong number, an UNCLASSIFIED READER.
 *
 * NON-TEST importers — the ones that can keep a SHIPPED key alive:
 *
 *   - `packages/app-shell/src/chrome/LoadingScreen.tsx` — the case this leg was
 *     built for. Bootstrap-critical UI: it must render BEFORE i18n loads, which
 *     is exactly the server-down boot it exists to explain, so it deliberately
 *     does not call `useObjectTranslation` (its own comment says so). It reads
 *     its pack subtree through a local binding. Covered BY DESIGN.
 *   - `packages/app-shell/src/console/ai/outboundAgentText.ts` — indexes its
 *     pack subtree DYNAMICALLY (`ai?.[key]`), so NEITHER leg sees the read: no
 *     dotted key, no property chain, no call site. Its four keys land in
 *     NEEDS-REVIEW anyway, but only because those property names happen to
 *     appear as string literals in the `OutboundAgentTextKey` union a few lines
 *     above them — BY LUCK, NOT BY DESIGN. Do NOT read this file as covered by
 *     the leg. Replace that union with anything generated and all four keys
 *     drop to CONFIRMED with a live consumer still reading them.
 *     ⚠️ Since objectui#7479 it reaches the pack through
 *     `getLoadedBuiltInLocales()` rather than a static `zh`/`en` import. NOTHING
 *     about the reading above changed — same dynamic index, same four keys, same
 *     luck — but the DERIVATION had to be widened to keep seeing it (see the
 *     alternation above). It is the one importer in this list whose membership
 *     depends on that widening, which is why it is said here as well as there.
 *   - `packages/plugin-grid/demo/main.tsx` and
 *     `packages/plugin-grid/demo/bulk-actions.tsx` — whole-pack `resources`
 *     wiring only, no per-key property reads: nothing for the leg to see and
 *     nothing at risk.
 *   - `packages/react/src/utils/nonGridRowCeiling.tsx` — the importer this
 *     section was missing when objectui#8752 was filed, and the one worth
 *     reading twice: it is the first instance in this tree of class 4 below.
 *     It dereferences the pack at render to supply the `defaultValue` beside a
 *     `t()` call, and BOTH keys it reads are TWO SEGMENTS. The property-chain
 *     leg returns `null` below three segments by design, and with the key
 *     boundary on (objectui#8701) the full-key probe refuses the property read
 *     too, because a `.` on the left is exactly what marks a longer key.
 *     Measured on a fixture carrying only the property-read line: no hit for
 *     either key under today's boundary, a hit for both under the pre-boundary
 *     substring behaviour. ⇒ BOTH LEGS ARE BLIND to this read.
 *     Nothing is at risk today, and the reason is a property of this FILE
 *     rather than of the leg: the same two keys are also spelled literally as
 *     the first argument of the `t()` call each default sits inside, so the AST
 *     pass reads them directly and neither is ever a candidate (measured: both
 *     absent from CONFIRMED and from NEEDS-REVIEW). ⇒ read this bullet as
 *     covered BY COINCIDENCE, the same tier as `outboundAgentText` above and
 *     for an unrelated reason. Build either key from a template, or move the
 *     default away from its call site, and both go dark to every leg while a
 *     shipping component still renders them — and that edit would read as a
 *     tidy-up.
 *
 * The rest of the matches are TEST-only importers, deliberately not listed one
 * by one. A key read only by a test is not a key a user can see, so a test
 * importer never establishes liveness — it only ever adds a textual footprint,
 * which the full-key probe already catches. The derivation returns both sets;
 * the split is the point, and it is the split — never a total — that the
 * bullets are answerable to.
 *
 * ## What CONFIRMED does NOT guarantee (objectui#7592)
 *
 * Every leg here is a syntactic probe, so CONFIRMED means "no leg saw a
 * reference", never "no consumer exists". Three classes are KNOWN to be able to
 * put a live key in this tier. They are enumerated so the claim this header
 * makes about the tier can be CHECKED against them instead of trusted:
 *
 *   1. A pack-object reader that indexes DYNAMICALLY — the `outboundAgentText`
 *      shape above. No dotted key, no property chain, no call site. Measured on
 *      this checkout, and it corrects the note above: its four keys are demoted
 *      to NEEDS-REVIEW by CHANGELOG entries and test files that spell them, NOT
 *      by the neighbouring type union, whose members are bare property names
 *      (`'planApproveMessage'`) and therefore match neither probe. The luck is
 *      real, it is not where objectui#6666 recorded it, and nothing holds it in
 *      place — a CHANGELOG is not a liveness argument.
 *   2. A key built by CONCATENATION (`'console.' + 'objectView.' + 'new'`), or
 *      by a builder shape the key-builder leg does not read: anything but one
 *      returned template literal, and anything that composes the head across
 *      modules.
 *   3. A consumer outside the AST walk's `packages/`+`apps/` scope that also
 *      never spells the key as text (gap 1 above).
 *   4. A pack-object property reader of a TWO-SEGMENT key (objectui#8701). The
 *      full-key probe used to catch that shape by accident, because a substring
 *      test accepts `somePack.topNs.leaf` as an occurrence of `topNs.leaf`; the
 *      key-boundary requirement refuses it, since a `.` on the left is exactly
 *      what marks a longer key. The property-chain leg does not take over below
 *      three segments (it returns `null` there on purpose), so for two-segment
 *      keys the enumerated importer list above is the only check left, and it
 *      is read by hand. Measured when the boundary became the default:
 *      re-deriving that list and reading every NON-TEST importer it returns,
 *      not one of them reads any of the keys the change re-tiered.
 *      ⚠️ That measurement stands, but it was taken over a list of FOUR that
 *      had already drifted to five (objectui#8752), so read it as "no wrong
 *      verdict was found", never as "the population was complete". The fifth —
 *      `nonGridRowCeiling.tsx`, bulleted above — is this class's first
 *      instance in the tree: two-segment keys read off the pack by property
 *      access, invisible to both legs, kept out of the tiers only by a literal
 *      `t()` argument sitting in the same expression. The list's COMPLETENESS
 *      is mechanical now (`derivePackObjectImporters()` plus its pin); what
 *      stays hand-read is what each importer's shape means.
 *
 * The tier is therefore the one to READ FIRST, and each entry still needs a
 * human before deletion. The cost of reading it as bulk-deletable is measured:
 * on the day objectui#7592 was filed, 33 of 147 CONFIRMED entries — 22% of the
 * tier — were one live subtree (`chatbot.tool.*`, rendering in ten packs), and
 * following the tier would have reverted every AI tool card to English in nine
 * locales. That class is closed; these four are not.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 *   node scripts/check-i18n-dead-keys.mjs             # report, exit 0 always
 *   node scripts/check-i18n-dead-keys.mjs --strict     # exit 1 if either CONFIRMED list is non-empty
 *   node scripts/check-i18n-dead-keys.mjs --json       # machine-readable, same tiers, both corpora
 *
 * `--strict` is not called by any workflow today; it exists so a future PR can
 * flip this into a real gate without a rewrite, once the false-positive rate
 * measured here is judged low enough (see the PR body for objectui#4658).
 * Making it enforcing is a maintainer decision for BOTH corpora, and for the
 * designer table it is explicitly out of objectui#8388's ruled scope.
 *
 * The script does exit non-zero for one class of thing, and it is not a
 * finding: a COLLAPSED scan. Both CLI guards below stop the run when the
 * corpus, the reference side or (for the designer table) the dynamic-head set
 * comes back implausibly small, because that failure does not look like a
 * broken tool — it looks like a longer, more confident report.

 *      documented as "read this first", never as "safe to bulk delete".

// ── the metadata-admin designer table (objectui#8388) ────────────────────────

/**
 * The SECOND corpus this file sweeps: the metadata-admin designer's own
 * module-local string table, `ENGINE_STRINGS_EN` / `ENGINE_STRINGS_ZH` in
 * `packages/app-shell/src/views/metadata-admin/i18n.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why it needs its own leg at all — both i18n gates are blind BY CONSTRUCTION
 *
 * Measured, not assumed (objectui#8388, comment 5592768866): a run of
 * `check:i18n-keys` and `check:i18n-drift` over a PR that deleted four provably
 * dead keys from this table returned exit 0 from both, and neither verdict was
 * about this table:
 *
 *   - `check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` walks CALL SITES and resolves each against
 *     the `en` PACK. A key no call site names is not a subject to it, so it can
 *     never report a dead one — the defect and that gate's blind spot are the
 *     same thing. It also classifies this module `module-local table` by
 *     declaration and skips it outright.
 *   - `check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` reads the TEN LOCALE PACKS. This table is not
 *     one of them; it is out of that gate's population entirely.
 *
 * ⇒ two green verdicts that look like coverage and measure something else. The
 * question this leg asks is the table's OWN MEMBERSHIP, from the declaration
 * side — the same mirror question `sweep()` above asks of the packs, which is
 * why it lives here rather than in a second script.
 *
 * ## Why it is report-only, and why the dynamic-head leg is load-bearing
 *
 * A plain literal-footprint sweep over this corpus finds ~226 of ~1660 `en`
 * keys with no literal spelling anywhere in shipped source, and the
 * overwhelming majority of those are LIVE — reached by a template head such as
 * a severity level or an access-explain operation, built at the call site from
 * a runtime value. Enforcing that would cry wolf ~226 times on a clean tree,
 * which is objectui#4658's own ruling for the pack sweep and objectui#8068's
 * argument against an instrument that claims more than it checks. Reporting it
 * is no better: a report that lists 226 candidates every run is not a report.
 *
 * So this leg subtracts template-head reachability BEFORE reporting, exactly as
 * `sweep()`'s `dynamicHeads` does for the packs, and in the same
 * recall-over-precision direction: any table key sharing a collected head's
 * prefix is a POSSIBLE runtime target of that substitution and is therefore
 * NOT called dead. Being wrong towards "still live" costs a key nobody deletes;
 * being wrong the other way deletes a shipping string.
 *
 * ## The three legs, and what each is blind to
 *
 *   1. LITERAL — every string literal (and no-substitution template) in
 *      non-test source under `packages/`+`apps/` whose text starts with one of
 *      `DESIGNER_KEY_ROOTS`. Deliberately not restricted to arguments of
 *      `t()`/`tOptional()`/`tFormat()`: a key parked in a config object and
 *      handed to a translator through a variable is just as live, and the AST
 *      pass cannot follow that indirection. Blind to: keys never spelled.
 *   2. DYNAMIC HEAD — the static head of every template expression in the same
 *      files whose head starts with one of the roots, INCLUDING the ones inside
 *      the table's own module (`translateNodeLabel` and `translateEnumOption`
 *      index `pickTable(locale).strings[...]` directly, with no `t()` call for
 *      any call-site walker to see). Blind to: a head composed across modules,
 *      or built by concatenation rather than a template literal.
 *   3. TEXT SAFETY NET — `textFootprint()`, the same whole-repo grep the pack
 *      sweep uses, minus the property-chain probe. It splits the survivors into
 *      CONFIRMED and NEEDS-REVIEW.
 *
 * ⚠️ The property-chain probe is OFF for this corpus, and that is a measured
 * decision rather than an omission. It exists for a consumer that imports a
 * locale PACK OBJECT and reads it by property access. Neither `ENGINE_STRINGS_`
 * table is exported from this module at all, so no such consumer can exist; the
 * only occurrences of those two identifiers outside the module are in one test
 * that re-reads the table out of the source. Turning it on would demote keys on
 * evidence about a shape this corpus cannot have.
 *
 * ⚠️ The DEFINITION FILE is excluded from the text net wholesale, not just its
 * two table literals — the module's own header docblock quotes example keys in
 * prose, and a whole-file grep would read that prose as a reader. The literal
 * and head legs still read that file, through the AST, where a comment is not a
 * node and the table literals are skipped explicitly.

 * `^  '…':` pattern answers a question about one indentation only — it cannot
 * see a nested or re-indented region, and it would also match a commented-out
 * row. The parser sees neither problem.
 *
 * ## The optional second argument (objectui#8834)
 *
 * This extractor is the ONLY reader of these tables, and it stays that way on
 * purpose. `check-i18n-designer-table-parity.mjs` and the designer population
 * of `check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` both call it rather than growing a second copy:
 * `changeset-guard.yml:63-72` records what the second copy costs here — the
 * base-ref resolver's second copy, in `check-i18n-en-drift.mjs`, inherited a
 * real defect from the first draft and had to be fixed to match under
 * objectui#3766. Single-sourcing is precedent in this repo, not preference.
 *
 * Every option DEFAULTS to the behaviour the dead-keys sweep already had, so
 * its own call below and the one in `check-i18n-dead-keys.test.ts` are
 * byte-identical to what they were:
 *
 *   - `consts` — which table constants to read. Callers that want a DIFFERENT
 *     population pass their own list instead of widening
 *     `DESIGNER_TABLE_CONSTS`: that constant is the dead-keys sweep's own
 *     corpus, and `TYPE_LABELS_*` / `DOMAIN_LABELS_*` keys do not sit under
 *     `DESIGNER_KEY_ROOTS`, so adding them there would change what this file's
 *     own gate sweeps as a side effect nobody asked for.
 *   - `source` / `label` — parse text the caller already has instead of the
 *     working-tree file. The drift population needs the table as it stood at a
 *     git BASE commit, which is a blob and not a file; git stays in the gate
 *     that already owns it (`check-i18n-en-drift.mjs`) rather than being
 *     learned here.
 *   - `withValues` — collect `key -> string` alongside the key sets. OFF by
 *     default, and when ON a value that is not a static string THROWS like any
 *     other stale-extractor signal. It is opt-in rather than always-on so that
 *     a future non-literal value cannot newly break the dead-keys sweep, which
 *     never asks about values. Measured on this checkout at the time it was
 *     added: all 3369 `ENGINE_STRINGS_*` values, all 72 `TYPE_LABELS_*` and all
 *     18 `DOMAIN_LABELS_*` values are plain `StringLiteral`s, so nothing today
 *     needs a tolerance this does not have.
 *   - `require` — whether a named constant that is ABSENT throws. It must stay
 *     `true` for every working-tree read: a silently empty table would make
 *     every `en` key read as one-sided and every `zh` key vanish from the
 *     corpus. It is turned off in exactly one place — the drift gate's BASE
 *     side, where a table that does not exist yet is a fact about history
 *     rather than a stale extractor, and the gate PRINTS every pair it had to
 *     skip for that reason instead of quietly comparing nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ None of these loosens what the extractor ACCEPTS at a given constant: the
 * property-form and key-form throws below are untouched, and they are the only
 * way this instrument knows it has gone stale.
 *
 * @param {string} root
 * @param {{ consts?: string[], source?: string | null, label?: string,
 *           withValues?: boolean, require?: boolean }} [options]
 * @returns {{ tables: Map<string, Set<string>>, corpus: Set<string>,
 *             values: Map<string, Map<string, string>> | null }}
 *   `corpus` is the UNION of both tables: a key present in only one of them is
 *   still a key of this bundle, and a dead `zh`-only key is exactly as dead as
 *   a dead `en` one. `values` is `null` unless `withValues` was asked for.
