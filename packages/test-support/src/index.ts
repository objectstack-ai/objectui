 * indirection is the objectui#4325 lesson applied ahead of time: a deep
 * subpath into another package (`@object-ui/fields/widgets/MarkdownContent`)
 * resolved only through this repo's vitest alias, was TS2882 for `tsc`, and was
 * ruled out rather than minted as permanent public API. A package's surface is
 * its index — including this one.

/**
 * ⛔ `defaults-table-scan.ts` is deliberately NOT re-exported here. It is reached
 * as `@object-ui/test-support/defaults-table-scan`, a DECLARED subpath in this
 * package's `exports` map — the same escape hatch `./zod-wrapper-keys` uses for
 * the case the index cannot serve.
 *
 * The index rule above still stands, and this is not a hole in it: it is the one
 * shape the index physically cannot carry. That module reads the workspace from
 * disk (`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:module`), so it only type-checks in a
 * program that has Node's ambient types — and a barrel re-export puts a module
 * into the program of EVERY consumer that imports the barrel for anything at all.
 *
 * Measured, not predicted (objectui#7884, PR objectui#7902): with the re-export
 * here, `tsc -p packages/data-objectstack/tsconfig.json --listFiles` pulled all
 * nine of this package's modules into that package's program, because one of its
 * tests imports `{ enumOptions }` from this index. `data-objectstack` has no
 * `node` types, so the repo-wide `pnpm turbo run type-check` failed with three
 * TS2591s in a file that package never asked for. The subpath keeps the Node-only
 * module out of every program that does not name it, which is the property a
 * shared test module owes its consumers: it adds no obligation to anyone.
 *
 * `objectui#4325`'s lesson is untouched — the hazard there was an UNDECLARED deep
 * path that resolved only through the vitest alias and was TS2882 for `tsc`. This
 * one is declared in `exports`, so `tsc` (moduleResolution `bundler`) resolves it
 * exactly as it resolves `.`.
