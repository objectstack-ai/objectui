/**
 * objectui#11173 — the `page:header` panel on screen after the designer's
 * `breadcrumb` toggle left `BLOCK_CONFIG['page:header']`.
 *
 * The sibling `previews/__tests__/block-config.test.ts` pins the TABLE (the
 * curated field set is `title` / `subtitle`). This file pins the two facts only
 * a real render and a real commit can answer:
 *
 *   - the panel offers no breadcrumb control, in either locale;
 *   - a page that ALREADY carries `breadcrumb` (a released designer build wrote
 *     it) opens, and its next save keeps the key. That is the triage ruling on
 *     the card: no strip in the designer. objectstack#20758's ADR-0087
 *     conversion is the one strip, on load, with its notice; a second strip
 *     here would be a second mechanism and would hide that notice. So
 *     `RETIRED_BLOCK_PROP_KEYS` has no `page:header` entry, and the round-trip
 *     case below is the control that goes red if one is added.
 *
 * FIXTURE DISCIPLINE (#3216's method, as in the sibling suites): the page is
 * authored the way a user does and fed through `PageSchema.parse`, so the
 * fixture cannot drift from the spec. `PageSchema` does not judge a block's
 * `properties` (the sibling `PageBlockInspector.retiredBlockProps.test.tsx`
 * header records that measurement), so the stored fixture keeps parsing when a
 * later spec pin tombstones the key.
