 * check-side-effects-array -- a `sideEffects` ARRAY must name EXACTLY the
 * modules that register something at load time.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-side-effects-array.mjs           # the verdict
 *   node scripts/check-side-effects-array.mjs --list    # the enumeration, per package
 *
 * ## Why this gate exists (objectui#6683)
 *
 * `sideEffects` is a PUBLISHED CONTRACT: every consumer's bundler reads it and
 * takes it at its word. `@object-ui/app-shell` declares it as an ARRAY because
 * the two simpler answers are both wrong for this package, and both wrongnesses
 * were MEASURED rather than argued:
 *
 *   - omitting the field   -> "assume every module does something on import",
 *                             so nothing in the package is shakeable. Measured
 *                             on the objectui#6683 branch: 3,310,672 bytes
 *                             gzipped in the console's eager closure.
 *   - `sideEffects: false` -> the bundler drops every module whose exports go
 *                             unused, including three live SDUI widget
 *                             registrations (`mcp:connect-agent`,
 *                             `cloud:onboarding-next`, `cloud:ai-model-status`)
 *                             that the barrel pulls in through BARE side-effect
 *                             imports. They fall to 0 chunks. Closed by
 *                             measurement in objectui#6535 / PR #6682.
 *
 * The array is the honest third answer. Its failure mode is the reason this
 * gate is not optional and ships in the SAME change as the array: an array that
 * is INCOMPLETE fails **silently, in someone else's bundle**. No error, no
 * warning, exit 0 -- the bundler believes it is executing a declaration rather
 * than discovering a defect. That is the same failure mode as `false`, only
 * harder to see, and the maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29 refuses a bare array
 * for exactly that reason.
 *
 * ## The rule, stated once
 *
 *     the array names EXACTLY:  entry forms
 *                             + every module in the package's entry graph that
 *                               performs a top-level REGISTRATION,
 *                               in BOTH its source and its published spelling
 *
 * ...where "the entry graph" is the union over EVERY entry point the manifest
 * publishes, de-duplicated into one module set. See "Which entry forms anchor
 * the walk" below: walking only the barrel made the gate blind in exactly its
 * own failure class, since a registrar reachable only from a secondary entry is
 * never proposed as MISSING and, if the array names it anyway, reads as STALE --
 * so the gate would ARGUE for deleting a correct entry (objectui#8850).
 *
 * Both directions are checked, because a `sideEffects` array can be wrong in
 * two ways and only one of them is loud:
 *
 *   - MISSING  -- a registering module the array does not name. A bundler drops
 *     it and the registration is gone from a consumer's app. Silent.
 *   - STALE    -- a name whose module no longer registers anything. It costs
 *     every consumer bytes, and it reads to the next author as "this module
 *     registers something", which is how a REAL entry gets deleted as noise.
 *
 * ## The enumeration is DERIVED, never listed
 *
 * The ruling is explicit that the implementing change re-derives the set
 * mechanically and never reuses a hand-copied list, so there is no list of
 * module paths anywhere in this file or in the array's neighbourhood -- the
 * array in `package.json` is the CLAIM and this file is the DERIVATION, and the
 * gate is the comparison of the two. A hand-copied enumeration would be a
 * second source of truth free to rot exactly as quietly as the array it was
 * meant to protect.
 *
 * ## What counts as a registration, and why an UNKNOWN effect is an ERROR
 *
 * {@link classifyEffect} sorts every top-level side effect a module's body
 * performs into exactly three buckets, and refuses anything it does not
 * recognise:
 *
 *   - `registration` -- a top-level CALL or `new`, written as a STATEMENT or
 *     performed while a top-level binding is INITIALISED (see the next
 *     section). Not "a call whose name looks like `register`": a name test is
 *     an under-reading, and an under-reading here is precisely the silent drop.
 *     `ComponentRegistry.register(...)`, `registerAppComponent(...)` and a
 *     hypothetical `Registry.add(...)` are indistinguishable to a bundler and
 *     are treated alike here.
 *   - `local-binding-write` -- `X.displayName = 'X'` where `X` is declared in
 *     THIS module and the right-hand side calls nothing. It is provably
 *     module-local: a bundler that drops the module drops its target too, so
 *     nothing outside can observe the difference. This is the carve-out that
 *     keeps three pure React components (and, through them, the route views
 *     they anchor) shakeable.
 *   - `side-effect-only-import` -- `import './x.js';`. A PROPAGATION edge, not
 *     an effect of its own. It is handled by {@link checkReachability} below
 *     rather than by making its importer unshakeable.
 *
 * Anything else is `unknown` and fails the gate with exit 2. That asymmetry is
 * the whole design: a new spelling of a load-time effect must make this gate
 * LOUD, never make it quietly decide the module is pure. "I did not recognise
 * that" and "that is not a registration" must not be the same answer.
 *
 * ## A call inside a top-level `const` initializer (objectui#8578)
 *
 * `export const X = f(...)` declares a binding AND runs `f` at load time. To a
 * bundler those are one statement: a module this array does not name is dropped
 * whole, and `f`'s effect leaves with the binding. Reading that shape as
 * "declares a constant, does nothing" was measured wrong on `@object-ui/types`'
 * `AnyComponentSchema = defineNodeComponentUnion(...)`, whose initializer writes
 * the node recursion point's option slot into a DIFFERENT module (`base.zod.ts`).
 *
 * The widening is NOT "any call in an initializer", and that is a measurement
 * rather than a preference: over this workspace that reading takes
 * `@object-ui/app-shell` from 14 registering modules to 122, because
 * `new Set([...])`, `React.createContext(...)`, `new RegExp(...)` and
 * `React.lazy(...)` are calls that produce the binding's VALUE and nothing else.
 * Naming their modules would spend exactly the consumer bytes the array exists
 * to save. So an initializer registers only when all three hold:
 *
 *   1. the call is EVALUATED NOW. The walk stops at every function boundary, so
 *      a closure that is RETURNED is not a load-time effect -- app-shell's
 *      `withSettleSignal` increments a module counter inside the wrapper it
 *      returns, and reading that as load-time is how this widening would score
 *      a pure wrapper as a registrar. A function handed as an ARGUMENT to a call
 *      being made now IS walked, because that call may invoke it now.
 *   2. the callee RESOLVES inside this package, through relative imports and
 *      re-exports only.
 *   3. that callee WRITES to a binding it did not itself declare -- the same
 *      argument `local-binding-write` makes one level out, applied to the
 *      callee's own scope: anything it did not declare outlives the call and is
 *      observable by someone other than the dropped module.
 *
 * What this still does NOT see, stated here rather than left to silence, since
 * a reader who mistakes silence for absence is the failure this gate is about:
 *
 *   - a call into ANOTHER package (`z.discriminatedUnion`, `React.createContext`,
 *     `new Set`) is read as value-producing. That is the boundary
 *     {@link walkEntryGraph} already draws, for the reason it gives: another
 *     package's load-time behaviour is that package's manifest's problem.
 *   - a registration a module performs only when something CALLS it is not a
 *     load-time effect at all, by construction. ⛔ do not read a zero here as
 *     "this package has no load-time effects", only as "none this gate can
 *     derive".
 *
 * ## Which entry forms anchor the walk (objectui#8850)
 *
 * `exports` keys that start with `.` are SUBPATHS -- separate things a consumer
 * can import, so separate graph roots. Everything below a subpath is a
 * CONDITION or a fallback array, and those choose a build FORMAT of the same
 * subpath. {@link classifyEntryForms} sorts every published form on that
 * structure first and -- only where the structure does not decide -- on what is
 * on disk, into `entry-point`, `duplicate-entry`, `alternate-format` and
 * `asset`, and refuses anything that is none of them.
 *
 * The refusal is the load-bearing half, and it is deliberately NOT "fail when a
 * form cannot be mapped back to a source file". Measured over this workspace:
 * the only two packages declaring an array publish, beside their barrel, a
 * STYLESHEET and the `require` half of the SAME entry. Both are unmappable and
 * neither is a defect, so a gate that failed on unmappable would be red on its
 * entire population on day one. What must be loud is a form this gate cannot
 * CLASSIFY -- because a skipped form is a skipped root, and a registrar behind
 * it would never be proposed as MISSING. Silently skipping it would rebuild the
 * gate's own silent-drop failure class one level up.
 *
 * ### ⛔ What this classification DECLINES to detect, and why (objectui#9124)
 *
 * `alternate-format` is decided from the manifest's structure alone, so a
 * DANGLING form -- one the manifest declares that will never exist on disk --
 * is NOT detected when it sits under a subpath that already has a real module
 * form. This is a declared gap, not an oversight, and the reason it is accepted
 * rather than closed is that the detection it replaces was never trustworthy:
 * it fired ONLY on an unbuilt checkout. On a built tree the same dangling form
 * existed as a build artefact and classified as an `asset`, silently. So the
 * choice was never "detect it or not" -- it was "let the verdict depend on
 * whether `dist/` happens to be present, or not", and this gate must not
 * (objectui#6893, objectui#7460, objectui#7671 are the measured instances of
 * that class in this repo's own gates).
 *
 * What the gap costs is bounded by the same structure that creates it: such a
 * form adds no graph root either way, because the module form under its subpath
 * IS the root and an alternate format reaches exactly what that root reaches.
 * So a registrar cannot hide behind it -- which is the harm the refusal below
 * exists to prevent, and it is untouched.
 *
 * ⛔ The gap is NOT widened to dangling forms under a subpath with no module
 * form. There, `existsInPackage` still decides, and a form that is neither a
 * module nor a file on disk is still refused loudly -- that is the `./ghost.js`
 * and subpath-`*` shape, and removing the check there was MEASURED to promote
 * such a form to a graph root and crash the walk on ENOENT.
 *
 * The genuine multi-entry population is ZERO today (a stylesheet is not a graph
 * root; a second format of one entry reaches exactly what that entry reaches),
 * so this widening changes no verdict in this workspace right now. It is the
 * next package with a real second entry -- `@object-ui/types`' `./zod`, whose
 * one load-time effect is unreachable from `src/index.ts`, is the measured
 * demonstration, and it is out of this gate's population only because it
 * declares `sideEffects: false` -- that the widening is for.
 *
 * ## Reachability -- naming a module is not enough
 *
 * A module named in the array is retained only when a RETAINED module still
 * imports it. So the array's promise only holds if every registering module is
 * reachable from an entry form through modules that are THEMSELVES covered.
 * A chain `barrel -> pure-helper -> registrar` breaks: the pure helper is
 * shakeable, so when its exports go unused it is dropped and takes the
 * registrar's edge with it -- the registrar is named, retained by nobody, and
 * gone. {@link checkReachability} rejects that shape.
 *
 * ## Scope, and why this is not the same gate as the consistency pin
 *
 * `scripts/__tests__/side-effects-declaration-consistency.test.ts`
 * (objectui#3943) asks whether a declaration AGREES WITH module bodies across
 * the whole workspace, and proves with a real bundler that the field is honoured
 * at all. It is the wider gate and it stays the authority on that question.
 *
 * This file asks the narrower one the ruling names: for an ARRAY, is the array
 * the exact enumeration? The two are deliberately independent -- they derive the
 * population by different routes (that one folds in the workspace ALIAS tables;
 * this one derives the source barrel and the published spelling from the
 * manifest) -- because two guards that share a derivation fail together.
 *
 * Exit codes follow this tree's convention that a broken gauge must be LOUDER
 * than a reading over the line:
 *
 *   0 -- every array agrees with its enumeration
 *   1 -- an array disagrees (missing / stale / unreachable)
 *   2 -- no trustworthy enumeration (unknown effect, unresolved specifier,
 *        no package found, a spelling map that does not round-trip)

 * Sort every published form into the three things a form can be, and refuse

 *
 * The walk is the check, so the question this answers is narrow and mechanical:
 * which forms are NEW GRAPH ROOTS? A form that is not a root is not thereby
 * uninteresting — it is one of two shapes that provably add no reachable module
 * to the enumeration, and each has to be recognised POSITIVELY:
 *
 *   - `entry-point`   -- the inverse of the spelling map lands on a source
 *     module that exists. It is a distinct thing a consumer imports, so it is
 *     walked. A subpath whose source module another subpath already claimed is
 *     an ALIAS of that entry: same root, no new modules, recorded as
 *     `duplicate-entry` rather than silently merged.
 *   - `alternate-format` -- the form is not a module, but a form under the SAME
 *     subpath is. Conditions below a subpath choose a build format, not an
 *     entry: the `require` half of an entry whose `import` half is already a
 *     root reaches exactly the modules that root reaches. ⭐ Decided from the
 *     manifest's own structure and NEVER from the filesystem (objectui#9124):
 *     it is a fact about the DECLARATION, so it must read the same on an
 *     unbuilt checkout as on a built one.
 *   - `asset`         -- the form is not a module, no form under its subpath is
 *     either, and it names a file that exists in the package exactly as
 *     published. A stylesheet is a resolution target and is not a graph root:
 *     there is no import to follow out of it. Positive evidence on both halves
 *     — the file is THERE, and no source module produces it — never "the map
 *     returned undefined".
 *
 * Anything else is UNCLASSIFIED and fails the gate loudly, and that is the
 * asymmetry this function exists for. "Could not MAP this form" must not be the
 * error — both forms this workspace publishes beside a barrel today are
 * unmappable and neither is a defect. "Could not CLASSIFY this form" must be,
 * because a form quietly skipped is a graph root quietly missing, and a
 * registrar reachable only from it would never be proposed as MISSING. That is
 * the gate's own silent-drop failure class, one level up.
 *
 * ⛔ Nothing here reads the `sideEffects` array, and nothing here tests a
 * package name or an extension allow-list. The classification is derived from
 * the manifest's own subpath structure and from what is on disk.
