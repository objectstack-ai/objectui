/**
 * An operator this bridge cannot express must be INERT, never destructive
 * (objectui#9372).
 *
 * ## The defect, and the split that carries it
 *
 * objectui#9363 repaired `isNull` / `isNotNull` one operator at a time. This
 * card is the same destruction four more times — `between`, `endsWith`,
 * `notContains`, `startsWith`, every one of them an ordinary entry in this
 * inspector's menu — and it separates two questions the card's own option list
 * ran together:
 *
 *   (i)  WHICH operators map to the dialect — a per-operator conformance
 *        question, answered below for three of the four.
 *   (ii) What happens when one does NOT map — not an open question. Erasing
 *        the author's stored filter is wrong whatever (i) answers.
 *
 * (ii) is what this file exists for, and it is fixed unconditionally: the
 * mechanism is that `undefined` out of {@link groupToCondition} means BOTH
 * "the author cleared the filter" AND "nothing survived serialization", and the
 * caller treated both as clear. That conflation is what makes an unmapped
 * operator destructive rather than inert.
 *
 * ## The second route, which needs no operator at all
 *
 * The conflation is reachable by blanking the VALUE of the only row — an
 * incomplete row is dropped by the same `continue`, the last part disappears,
 * and the function answers `undefined`. Pinned below beside the operator
 * route, because it is the same defect and a repair aimed only at operators
 * would leave it standing.
 *
 * ## What "leave it alone" is, and what it is deliberately not
 *
 * {@link isClearedGroup} answers the one question the caller could not ask
 * before: was `undefined` the author's CLEAR gesture? Only then is `undefined`
 * committed. Otherwise the caller patches nothing and the stored filter is
 * untouched.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT "emit something". Emitting a filter in a spelling that means something
 * else is worse than dropping — that is the whole reason the unmapped arm
 * exists, and it survives this repair intact.
 *
 * ## `between`, flipped (objectui#10062)
 *
 * This file used to pin `between` as the one offered operator still unmapped,
 * because nothing told a half-typed pair from a finished one. The builder's
 * own `isFilterValueComplete` does (objectui#5025), the bridge now asks it, and
 * the last block below is the flipped pin: both bounds ⇒ `$between`, a missing
 * bound ⇒ not emitted, and the conformance reading every other mapped operator
 * got. The (ii) gestures above keep their meaning with `between` as the
 * UNFINISHED-row route rather than the unmapped-operator one.
 *
 * ## Red-first
 *
 * Predicted before running, on the unmodified tree: the (ii) block fails at
 * `isClearedGroup` not being a function, and the three (i) mappings fail with
 * `undefined`, while the `equals` control in the SAME run passes — a table of
 * all-`undefined` answers and a dead function look identical otherwise.
