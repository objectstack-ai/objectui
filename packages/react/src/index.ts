// "Is this a real config bag?" — the ONE definition of that question
// (objectui#6761), exported at the package entry for the same reason the node-gate
// reporter above is (objectui#6038): a surface in `@object-ui/components`, which
// depends on this package, asks it too. `element:*` renderers there read their
// config out of `{ ...schema.props, ...schema.properties }`, the third channel of
// the degenerate-bag hazard objectui#6752 / objectui#6760 closed here
// (objectui#6783). A second copy one package over would be a spelling that
// `utils/configBag.pin.test.ts` — which scans `packages/react/src` — cannot see,
// which is the drift that pin exists to stop.

// Node-gate predicate diagnostics. Exported at the package entry (objectui#6038)
// so every surface that evaluates a node `visibleWhen` reports a fault through
// ONE reporter and ONE dedupe `Set` — `page:tabs` item predicates live in
// `@object-ui/components`, which depends on this package. A second copy of the
// reporter would mean a second rate limit, and the same broken predicate would
// then be entitled to one line per package instead of one line, which is the
// property the 2026-08-25 ruling asked for.

  // the dedupe `Set` and the reset above are still the only ones.

// The per-surface scope hint those two take (objectui#6487). Exported because

// advice by default, which is the defect that card fixed.

// REMOVES it there, so "the gate did NOT bite" was the one sentence that could
// not be true for them. Widening a union re-exported from this entry is a
