/**
 * The filter's display name for the active UI language (objectui#4032, merged
 * scope from the #4163 part-1 audit).
 *
 * `GlobalFilterSchema.label` is the spec's `I18nLabel`, so an author may write
 * an inline per-locale map. Every read site below used to be `def.label ||
 * def.name`, which is wrong TWICE over:
 *
 *  1. a map reached a text node / `aria-label` / `placeholder` and stringified
 *     to `[object Object]` — in the Select's case inside a template literal,
 *     rendering `[object Object]: All`;
 *  2. an object is ALWAYS TRUTHY, so `||` never fell through to `def.name` —
 *     not even for `{}`, or a map with no entry for any locale. The same
 *     truthiness fact #4163 pinned on `DashboardGridLayout`'s header gate.
 *
 * Resolving FIRST and testing the resolved string fixes both at once: there is
 * one call, it yields a string, and the `||` fallback below is reached exactly
 * when that string is empty.
 *
 * Returns `''` rather than applying a fallback itself, because the three
 * controls do not share one: the built-in `dateRange` falls back to a
 * TRANSLATED "Date range", the others to the raw `def.name`. Folding those
 * together here would have made an unlabelled date filter read `dateRange`.
 *
 * ## The translation-bundle rung (objectui#10132)
 *
 * `GlobalFilterSchema.object` names the object whose bundle entry keys this
 * filter's labels — the spec's describe text for it reads "Object whose
 * `fields.<object>.<field>` translation-bundle entry resolves this filter's
 * field label and option labels". Nothing here read it, so a filter declaring
 * it rendered the raw field name on a translated console.
 *
 * `useSafeFieldLabel().fieldLabel` IS that convention's resolver — the one
 * every list and form already calls, walking the app namespaces for
 * `fields.<object>.<field>`. ⛔ No second resolver was written: the spec's own
 * wording for this key is "zero new i18n vocabulary, one resolver path", and a
 * private lookup here would have been the second path it forbids.
 *
 * Precedence follows that resolver's own signature — `fieldLabel(object,
 * field, fallback)` returns the bundle entry when there is one and the
 * fallback otherwise — so a translator's bundle wins over the metadata
 * literal, exactly as it does for every other field label on the console. The
 * authored `label` (resolved first, since it may itself be an inline locale
 * map) is that fallback. A filter that names no `object` never reaches the
 * resolver at all, so every dashboard authored before this key existed renders
 * unchanged.

/**
 * The wiring between the date select's "Custom…" item and the range calendar's
 * popover (objectui#10843).
 *
 * Two facts rule out the obvious wiring (opening the popover from the
 * select's `onValueChange`). Both were read in Chromium when this was written;
 * `DashboardFilterBar.customReopen-10843.test.tsx` re-derives them through the
 * real select on every run.
 *
 *  1. **An unchanged value is never reported.** Radix Select reports a pick
 *     through controllable state, which calls back only when the value CHANGES.
 *     With a custom range stored the select's value already is the "Custom…"
 *     item, so picking it again reported nothing and the calendar never opened:
 *     a stored range could not be reopened for editing.
 *  2. **The select's focus return dismisses a popover opened during the pick.**
 *     Once its closing animation ends, the select's content hands focus back to
 *     its trigger. A popover opened by the pick is already showing by then, and
 *     that focus leaving it dismisses it. From a preset the calendar mounted and
 *     was gone as soon as the select finished closing.
 *
 * Radix Select items have no `onSelect` event (that is the menu primitives').
 * Radix picks "Custom…" in two ways, and each needs its own wiring:
 *
 *  - **From the open list:** the item's pointer-up, click or Enter/Space key,
 *    depending on the input. The item marks its own activation, and the
 *    popover opens in the select's `onCloseAutoFocus`, after the list is gone,
 *    where the focus return is cancelled so the popover can take focus itself.
 *    The mark lives for that one event only: it counts when the select closes
 *    DURING it, which is what a pick does (the item runs its own handlers
 *    before Radix's, and a controlled `open` reports the close synchronously).
 *    A key or pointer event on the item that does not close the select, such
 *    as a space typed as part of type-ahead, has cleared its mark before any
 *    later close reads it.
 *  - **From the CLOSED trigger's type-ahead:** typing the first letter of
 *    "Custom…" on the focused, closed select changes the value with no item
 *    event and no list, so no focus return follows and the popover opens
 *    straight from `onValueChange` (`onCustomValue`). Only a changed value is
 *    reported here too, so with a custom range already stored this path does
 *    nothing, as Radix's type-ahead skips the current item. An in-list pick
 *    also reports a changed value, but while the select is still open (Radix
 *    calls `onValueChange` before `onOpenChange(false)`); `onCustomValue`
 *    leaves that one to the item's mark. Opening there would be wrong as well
 *    as early: an Enter pick opened the calendar during its own keydown, the
 *    key's activation then landed on the calendar's first button (its
 *    previous-month arrow), and the calendar opened a month back.
 *
 * The popover's own trigger is an invisible anchor that cannot take focus, so
 * closing the calendar would leave focus on the page body. Focus goes back to
 * the select's trigger instead, unless the calendar closed because the user
 * pointed or tabbed somewhere else: the same rule Radix's non-modal popover
 * applies to its own trigger.

/**
 * Pair an option-source response into `{ value, label }` options — the
 * COMMITTED value from the server's raw grouped values, the visible text from
 * the displayed row (objectui#4465).
 *
 * The dataset option source is a GROUP BY whose response carries the same two
 * forms every dataset answer does: `rows` holds the SERVER-RESOLVED DISPLAY
 * LABELS (`{status: 'In Review'}`) and the index-aligned `drillRawRows` holds
 * the RAW stored values (`{status: 'in_review'}`). Reading the value off `rows`
 * committed `status = 'In Review'` into every bound widget's `runtimeFilter`,
 * and no stored record carries that string — the widgets re-queried and
 * repainted to "No rows". Only the label was ever meant to come from `rows`.
 *
 * The reading discipline is MIRRORED from the drill path, which consumes this
 * exact response correctly and always has: `DatasetWidget`'s `openDrill` reads
 * `drillRawRows?.[index]` at the SAME INDEX the display row was resolved at,
 * and `buildDatasetDrillFilter` documents why ("the dimension's RAW grouped
 * value … NOT the visible row which carries the display LABEL — a
 * select/lookup label would mis-filter"). One response, one reading. No helper
 * is shared with it: that one builds an ObjectQL filter keyed by object FIELD
 * (ANDing `runtimeFilter` and date ranges), which has no overlap with pairing
 * an option list, and reshaping it to fit would refactor the drill path to
 * serve this call site.
 *
 * Two deliberate abstentions, both landing on today's read (labels as values)
 * rather than on a guess:
 *
 *  - **Length disagreement.** Index pairing is only meaningful while the two
 *    arrays are index-aligned, and a length mismatch is the one signal that
 *    they are not. Pairing anyway would commit ANOTHER row's raw value —
 *    silently wrong in a NEW way, and indistinguishable from a correct filter
 *    that legitimately matched nothing. Labels-as-values is at least visibly
 *    wrong, and it is what this call site did before.
 *  - **The raw rows do not speak this field at all.** A `dateGranularity`
 *    dimension is excluded from `drillRawRows` by the server (it sends
 *    `drillRanges` instead), so raw rows carrying none of `valueField` are the
 *    server saying "there is no raw form of this dimension", not a defect.
 *
 * Within a trusted pairing an INDIVIDUAL row whose raw value is absent/empty is
 * skipped, exactly as an absent/empty displayed value was skipped before —
 * falling back to that row's label there would re-commit a label as a value for
 * that one option, which is the defect, one row at a time. `rawRows` absent
 * entirely (the client-side `find` path, or a server that sends no drill
 * metadata) is the same abstention: value and label both come from the row, as
 * before.
