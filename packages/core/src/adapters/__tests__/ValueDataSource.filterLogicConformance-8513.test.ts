/**
 * objectui#8513 — `ValueDataSource`'s OBJECT dialect answers grouped filters
 * the way the platform already answers them, measured against the PUBLISHED
 * standard rather than against a hand-written restatement of it.
 *
 * ## Why the spec's own table, and not a local fixture
 *
 * `FILTER_LOGIC_CASES` (`@objectstack/spec/data`) is the cross-backend
 * conformance table for the combinator family: a four-row fixture whose
 * `(a, b)` columns are a 2x2 truth table — so a wrongly-OR-ed pair of
 * predicates shows up as extra ids rather than passing by luck of the data —
 * plus a nullable `d` column, plus 29 cases each naming the ids it must match.
 * The five platform drivers are held to it. Writing a local fixture instead
 * would be this adapter hand-mirroring what upstream publishes, which is the
 * exact shape objectui#8600 filed against this same file for the text
 * operators. The table is the standard; this file just drives it.
 *
 * It also settles the empty-combinator identities without restating them.
 * objectstack#5322 (closed `completed`, merged as objectstack#5365) ruled
 * `{ $and: [] }` TRUE / every row and `{ $or: [] }` FALSE / no row, and the
 * table carries all four identity cases. An assertion written here from the
 * card's prose could drift from that ruling; a table-driven one cannot.
 *
 * ## The `$not` partition is PINNED, not skipped
 *
 * `$not` is out of scope for #8513 — this repo's `convertFiltersToAST` still
 * throws for it, on a narrowing about the AST rather than about upstream's
 * ruling, and whether that narrowing should stand is a separate question. So
 * the `$not`-bearing cases are not silently filtered out of the run: the
 * partition itself is asserted, by NAME and by SIZE, and the excluded cases are
 * asserted to fail in the REFUSAL direction (no rows, one logged reason). Three
 * things therefore break this file rather than passing quietly:
 *
 *   - implementing `$not` (the excluded cases start passing → move them);
 *   - a new `$not` case landing upstream (the named partition no longer
 *     matches → decide about it deliberately);
 *   - `$not` regressing to its pre-objectui#8447 fail-OPEN behaviour, where it
 *     matched EVERY row (the refusal assertions go red).
 *
 * That last one is why this file asserts the refusal instead of `it.skip`:
 * `$not` failed in the OPPOSITE direction from `$and` / `$or` before #8447, and
 * a fix that flattened the three combinators into one arm is the specific
 * regression objectui#8513 was told not to allow.
 *
 * ## Ablation (run, not reasoned about)
 *
 * Recorded here because this file is the one that would go quiet if the fix
 * were reverted. Both legs were rebuilt to `dist/` and re-run; see the PR body
 * for the on-disk proof.
 *
 * | ablation | conformance cases passing |
 * |---|---|
 * | `matchesFilter` restored to its pre-#8513 bytes (combinators refused) | 10 / 29 |
 * | this change | 27 / 29 |
 *
 * The 17 cases that move are not only the two identity ones: every case whose
 * filter carries a group at all — including the three `read scope:` shapes,
 * which are the ones a sharing rule actually looks like — answered ZERO ROWS
 * before. The 10 that passed without the fix are the ungrouped operator cases,
 * plus `{ $or: [] }` and `{ $not: {} }`, which expect no rows and so were
 * satisfied by the refusal for the wrong reason.

/**
 * How an object-dialect combinator gets to `ValueDataSource` at all.
 *
 * The card assumed the producer was `filterGroupToMongo`
 * (`packages/fields/.../FilterConditionField.tsx`). It is not: that widget's
 * value is stored criteria the SERVER's sharing evaluator spreads into
 * `engine.find`, and it never passes through this adapter.
 *
 * The producer that does reach here is this repo's own single filter sink.
 * `convertFiltersToAST` returned the ORIGINAL OBJECT when a filter lowered to
 * no conditions, and the identity groups were exactly that case — so
 * `toFilterNode` handed `{ $and: [] }` and `{ $or: [{}] }` back UNLOWERED, and
 * every consumer on that chain (`ObjectGrid`'s `schemaFilter`, `plugin-list`'s
 * `buildEffectiveFilter`, `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView`) dropped them straight
 * onto `$filter`. Before this change the matcher answered ZERO ROWS for both,
 * on filters whose ruled answer is EVERY row — the worst direction, on the
 * reachable path.
 *
 * ⚠️ The PRODUCER half moved afterwards: objectui#8770 made `convertFiltersToAST`
 * answer `undefined` — "no constraint" — for a filter that is nothing but
 * TRUE-identity combinators, so this matcher is no longer handed those objects
 * BY THAT CHAIN. The matcher's own answer is asserted below all the same, and
 * deliberately from the object literals rather than through `toFilterNode`: it
 * is a `DataSource` with a public `find`, the object dialect is what
 * `QuerySchema.where` declares, and #8513's ruling is about what this adapter
 * answers — not about which producer happens to call it this month.
