/**
 * The `ui` layout primitives DECLARE the containment they render (objectui#6740).
 *
 * `flex` renders `schema.children` and always has, but its registration omitted
 * `isContainer` while `grid`, `card`, `container` and `stack` — same directory,
 * same namespace — all declared it. The render path never reads the flag, so
 * nothing was broken at runtime; the consumers are elsewhere, and the gap made
 * them contradict the renderer.
 *
 * MEASURED on b76ca6764, through the mechanism rather than the property: the
 * manifest built the way the app builds it, with a `flex` node carrying children
 * put through `validateTree`, returned `["not-a-container"]`, while `grid` /
 * `card` / `container` under the identical probe returned `[]`. Downstream,
 * objectstack's three shipped `examples/app-showcase` html pages drew 232
 * diagnostics of which 32 were warnings — every one of them `not-a-container` on
 * `flex`, and `flex` the only source of them.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE PINS FOUR COMPONENTS AND NOT ONE. The defect's shape is "three
 * declare it and one does not". A pin covering only `flex` would let the next
 * registration rot exactly the same way and stay green while it did, so the
 * assertion is over the family. `stack` rides along for the same reason.
 *
 * WHY THROUGH `validateTree` AND NOT `getConfig(t).isContainer`. The property is
 * only interesting because a mechanism reads it; asserting the literal would
 * stay green if the containment check were removed, mis-keyed, or fed a manifest
 * the tag is missing from — the three ways this fact dies without anyone
 * noticing. The reachability controls below exist for the same reason.
 *
 * RE-POINTED BY objectui#9910 (2026-09-24). What `validateTree` reads is no
 * longer the flag but the declared `children` slot input (`acceptsChildren`);
 * the four declare both. The flag keeps its OTHER consumer — the react-page
 * JSX scope skips containers — which is what the second describe still pins,
 * and the childless control moved from `badge` (which now declares the slot it
 * renders as a label fallback) to `tabs` (renders `items[].content`, never
 * `schema.children`).
