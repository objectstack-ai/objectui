/**
 * Every name `src/form.ts` exports is on the root barrel's `./form.js` named
 * re-export list -- or it is ledgered below with the reason it is not
 * (objectui#9406).
 *
 * ## The defect this closes, twice over
 *
 * `@object-ui/types` publishes the same declarations through more than one
 * entry point: the root (`.`), the `./form` subpath, and -- for the zod twins
 * -- `./zod`. `index.ts` re-exports `form.ts` through an EXPLICIT named list,
 * so a declaration added to `form.ts` and not to that list is published on the
 * subpath and invisible from the root, with nothing to say whether that was a
 * decision or an oversight.
 *
 * It has now been found twice, one name at a time:
 *
 *  - objectui#7697 -- `ComboboxOption`. `import type { ComboboxOption } from
 *    '@object-ui/types'` read `TS2305` while its two siblings on the same list
 *    resolved. Repaired by one additive barrel line.
 *  - objectui#9406 -- `InputShorthandSchema` and `UiCalendarSchema`, armed on
 *    the zod barrel by objectui#9067 and still unnamed on this one. Repaired
 *    the same way, by the director seat's decision batch #133 item 2, letter
 *    (a), maintainer 2026-09-14.
 *
 * ⭐ What made the second one worse than "the name is not there" is the
 * compiler's guess: the root spelling answered `error TS2724: '"@object-ui/
 * types"' has no exported member named 'UiCalendarSchema'. Did you mean
 * 'CalendarSchema'?` and `... named 'InputShorthandSchema'. Did you mean
 * 'InputOTPSchema'?`. Those are DIFFERENT components -- `ui:calendar` and
 * `calendar` resolve to different renderers, and `InputOTPSchema` is not an
 * input at all. An author following the suggestion writes an import that
 * compiles and means something else, which is worse than one that fails.
 *
 * ## Why this pin is DERIVED and not a pair of presence assertions
 *
 * ⛔ A pin reading "`InputShorthandSchema` and `UiCalendarSchema` are present"
 * would pass on the day a thirty-third declaration lands in `form.ts` and is
 * forgotten -- which is this class reopening a third time, the exact thing the
 * ruling asked to be made impossible. So the population is DERIVED on every
 * run from `form.ts`'s own export statements, the barrel's list is derived from
 * the clause itself, and the verdict is the SET DIFFERENCE. No count and no
 * name list is written down here except in the ledger, where each row is a
 * decision carrying its reason.
 *
 * ⚠️ Every name a ledger row holds is re-checked for LIVENESS: a row whose name
 * `form.ts` no longer declares, or which has since reached the barrel, fails
 * this file. A ledger that keeps rows after their reason is gone stops being
 * read -- and the whole value of ledgering an absence is that the reason lives
 * in the tree rather than in a `.changeset/*.md` the next release deletes.
 *
 * ## Two legs, because one of them is invisible to `vitest`
 *
 * The type-level block is erased by the compiler and says nothing during
 * `pnpm test`; its enforcement is `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`, the third leg of
 * this package's `type-check` script, which CI runs as its own job. The source
 * scan is the half that runs under `vitest`. It is deliberately NOT a `dist/`
 * read, for the reason `combobox-option-root-barrel-7697.test.ts` and
 * `package-exports-manifest.test.ts` already record for this package: the
 * per-PR `test` job runs `pnpm test` with no build ahead of it, so a test
 * needing a fresh `dist/` would be vacuously absent-or-red on a cold cache.
