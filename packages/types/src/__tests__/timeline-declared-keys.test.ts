/**
 * Declaration pin — the eight presentational keys `TimelineRenderer` reads that
 * `TimelineSchema` did not declare (objectui#6170).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `TimelineSchema` declared `events` (REQUIRED), `orientation` and `position`,
 * and nothing else. `TimelineRenderer`
 * (`plugin-timeline/src/renderer.tsx:250`) is annotated `schema:
 * TimelineSchema` and reads nine keys off it — `variant`, `items`,
 * `dateFormat`, `onItemClick`, `minDate`, `maxDate`, `rowLabel`, `scale`,
 * `timeScale` — and NONE of the three that were declared. So the exported type
 * matched neither what authors write, nor what the designer offers (the
 * registration's own `inputs`), nor what the renderer reads; those three agreed
 * with each other all along.
 *
 * The divergence was invisible to `tsc` because `BaseSchema` carries
 * `[key: string]: any`, so every undeclared key resolved as `any` and the
 * annotation constrained nothing. Its most visible casualty was the docs page's
 * own TypeScript example, which did not compile — `events` was required and
 * nothing on the page ever writes it. That example is pinned below.
 *
 * Eight of the nine are declared. `onItemClick` is deliberately NOT: it is a
 * runtime slot `ObjectTimeline` installs when it composes the schema it hands
 * to `TimelineRenderer`, and this package keeps callback-shaped keys off the
 * authored surface (`RuntimeOnlyDeclared` in `zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`).
 *
 * ## What the pin has teeth against, and what it does not
 *
 * Same ceiling as objectui#5903's gantt pin, and stated here rather than left
 * to be assumed. `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()` on the zod side and carries
 * an index signature on the TS side (objectui#5155 / objectui#6269 own that
 * ceiling; this card does not touch it), so:
 *
 *   - an UNDECLARED key is still accepted by both halves. Declaring these eight
 *     did NOT buy rejection of a misspelling;
 *   - a DECLARED key IS validated. `variant: 'diagonal'` type-checked and
 *     parsed green before this card and is refused now — that is the accept-set
 *     narrowing landed here;
 *   - on the TS side a read site can never be the detector, because the index
 *     signature types `schema.variant` as `any` either way. So the compile-time
 *     pin is the `@ts-expect-error` block at the bottom: remove a declaration
 *     and its member resolves to `any`, the wrong-typed assignment starts
 *     succeeding, and the now-unused directive fails the build (TS2578) NAMING
 *     the key. `tsconfig.test.json` compiles this file, so that is real
 *     enforcement and not decoration (objectui#3009).
 *
 * ## The three keys that were declared and never read — now RETIRED
 *
 * `events` / `orientation` / `position` had zero read points. Stage 1 of
 * objectui#6170 made `events` required → OPTIONAL, the smallest change that let
 * the documented authoring form compile, and pinned all three here as STILL
 * DECLARED so the removal would be a deliberate edit against a red test rather
 * than a silent drift. Stage 2 (the maintainer ruling's ADR-0049
 * enforce-or-remove route, taken as REMOVE) has now made that edit: all three
 * are `?: never` / `retirementTombstone()` tombstones. What this file keeps of
 * them is the part that is still ITS claim — they stay declared, and absent
 * stays valid; the refusals themselves, with their counter-probes, are pinned
 * in `timeline-dead-keys-retired-6170.test.ts`.
