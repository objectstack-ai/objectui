 * URL range/comparison operator suffix → ObjectQL operator (READ side).
 *
 * ## No prototype, because the URL chooses the key (objectui#9507)
 *
 * `parseUrlFilterTriples` decides "is this suffix an operator" by looking the
 * suffix up here and testing the result for truthiness — and the suffix comes
 * from the address bar. While this was a plain object literal that question was
 * also answered by `Object.prototype`: `filter[amount][constructor]` resolved to
 * `Object.prototype.constructor`, passed the guard, and emitted a triple whose
 * OPERATOR WAS A JS FUNCTION — neither ignored nor downgraded, the two outcomes
 * `parseUrlFilterTriples` promises are the only ones. `__proto__` was the same
 * defect in a second shape: its inherited accessor yielded `Object.prototype`
 * itself, so that suffix produced an operator that was an OBJECT.
 *
 * ⛔ The repair is deliberately NOT a list of member names to refuse. A denylist
 * is a spelling-level patch that the next member of `Object.prototype` walks
 * straight past, and it would have to be kept in step with a prototype this
 * module does not own. Removing the prototype removes the construction that
 * permitted the answer at all, so an own entry is the only thing a lookup here
 * can ever find. The sweep in `drillUrlFilters.test.ts` enumerates
 * `Object.prototype` at run time rather than naming members, for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * ⚠️ The exported face is unchanged and must stay unchanged: same name, same
 * four entries, same `Record<string, string>` type, same behaviour under
 * spread, `Object.entries` and `Object.keys` — `ObjectDataPage` inverts this
 * map to bridge a triple's operator to the spec's alias spelling, and
 * `drillEmptyBucketNavHost-9085.test.ts` pins its key list. ⛔ Do not "simplify"
 * it back to an object literal.

/**
 * The EMPTINESS operator pair (objectui#9159, completed by objectui#9508), in
 * the ONE place both sides read it from, so the write and read halves cannot
 * drift apart on its spelling.
 *
 * ## One param, whose VALUE is the direction — not a comparand
 *
 * Every range and equality member of this vocabulary carries a value the user
 * is filtering BY. This one carries none: the condition is "this dimension is
 * empty" or "this dimension is set", and the param's boolean says WHICH. Three
 * consequences, all deliberate and all pinned:
 *
 *   - `filter[field][null]=false` IS the is-not-null operator (objectui#9508).
 *     objectui#9159 ruled it deliberately not an operator, on a premise it
 *     stated outright — this dialect could not WRITE "is not null", so a
 *     read-side-only operator would have been a second contract with no
 *     producer. objectui#9508 supplies that producer in the write arm below, in
 *     the same commit, so the premise is DISCHARGED rather than overridden and
 *     the read side is never alone with an operator nothing emits.
 *   - anything else in that slot is still dropped like an unknown suffix —
 *     never downgraded to `is_null false`, never to an equality against the
 *     string the param happens to hold.
 *   - equality-to-empty-string is not a substitute: `parseUrlFilterTriples`
 *     skips a param whose value is `''`, so `filter[owner]=` round-trips to no
 *     condition at all. Both spellings are non-empty literals for that reason.
 *
 * ## Why TWO producer keys are read, not one
 *
 * `convertFiltersToAST` lowers four producer spellings onto these two
 * operators: `$null` carries the direction verbatim and `$exists` carries its
 * inverse. Both are read here, because the two drill routes deliver different
 * ones — measured, not assumed:
 *
 *   - a COMPOSED drill filter only ever arrives spelled `$null`.
 *     `composeDrillFilter` lowers through the spec's `parseFilterAST`, which
 *     canonicalises `is_not_null` back to `{ $null: false }`, so an authored
 *     `$exists` is already gone by the time it reaches this function.
 *   - an UNCOMPOSED one arrives spelled however the author wrote it. A widget
 *     that hands its own resolved filter straight to the escape hatch
 *     (`ObjectMetricWidget`, whose drawer renders `OpenInListButton`) passes
 *     through no canonicaliser at all, so `$exists` reaches this function
 *     verbatim — and the dataset filter inspector's "is not empty" row writes
 *     exactly that pair.
 *
 * ⚠️ A NON-boolean under either key says nothing about emptiness and writes
 * nothing, which is what it did before this pair existed.
 *
 * ⚠️ When both keys are present and DISAGREE, one param key cannot carry two
 * directions. `$null` wins, deterministically and pinned, and the drill
 * degrades to a superset — the same posture this module already takes for two
 * conditions on one field and operator. It is a superset whichever way it goes:
 * such an object asks for `is_null` AND `is_not_null`, which selects no rows at
 * all, and no single param is narrower than that.
 *
 * ⚠️ `param` is deliberately NOT an entry in {@link URL_FILTER_OPS}. That map is
 * the RANGE vocabulary, and `ObjectDataPage` inverts it to bridge a triple's
 * operator to the spec's own alias spelling. Both `op` and `notOp` here are
 * already canonical `ViewFilterRule` operator words, so bridging them would map
 * them to the aliases `'null'` / `'not_null'`, which `normalizeFilterOperator`
 * passes through verbatim and the rule schema then rejects — a saved view that
 * silently loses this condition. Keeping this pair out of the range map is what
 * keeps "Save as view" correct.

 * (drill degrades to a superset) rather than stringified to
 * `"[object Object]"`.
 *
 * ⚠️ A JS `null` VALUE stays "no condition", and is not the is-null spelling: it
 * is what a producer writes when it has nothing to say about the field. The
 * empty bucket says something, and says it as `{ $null: true }` (objectui#9085).
 *
 * ## `$and` is flattened, because this dialect's conjunction is implicit
 *
 * A drill filter composed from more than one source arrives as
 * `{ $and: [<widget filter>, <click context>] }` — what `composeDrillFilter`
 * (`@object-ui/core`) lowers `widget.filter ∧ drill.filter` to (objectui#8944).

 * together, so a top-level `$and` is expressible here: emit each child's params
 * into the same set and `parseUrlFilterTriples` reads the conjunction straight
 * back. Nesting is walked too, since composing three sources nests.
 *
 * ⚠️ Without this branch a composed filter took the `String(value)` path below —
 * `$and` holds an ARRAY, so it was neither `null` nor a non-array object — and
 * the URL grew a bogus `filter[$and]=[object Object],[object Object]` while BOTH
 * real conditions vanished. That is the very outcome this function's contract
 * says it never produces, and it is wrong in the widening direction: the list
 * lands unscoped by anything the user actually clicked.
 *
 * ⚠️ Two conditions on the SAME field and operator are NOT expressible here (one
 * param key, one value). The later source wins, so a click context still
 * overrides the widget's condition on that field exactly as it did when this
 * value was built by spreading — the drill degrades to a superset there, the
