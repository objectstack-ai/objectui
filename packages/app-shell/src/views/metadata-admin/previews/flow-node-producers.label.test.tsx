/**
 * **Every flow-node PRODUCER writes a `label`** — objectui#6331.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at the producer and not at the reader
 *
 * `FlowNodeSchema` requires `label` (`z.string()`); the designer's own
 * {@link FlowDesignerNode} makes it optional, and that is a deliberate LAYER
 * difference, not drift — a canvas holds nodes the user has dropped but not
 * finished, so typing it as the spec's would make the editor's own
 * intermediate state unrepresentable. Both are true only if something
 * guarantees a node ACQUIRES a label before it is saved. This file is that
 * something.
 *
 * ⛔ The reader-side type is NOT the enforcement point, and this is measured,
 * not asserted. objectui#6287 made `label` required on the reader type and got
 * `tsc` exit 0 with **zero errors**: every node reaches that type through
 * `as InspectorFlowNode[]` casts out of `Record<string, unknown>`, and **a cast
 * bypasses a required member**. It is also mildly harmful — `node.label ?? ''`
 * and `node.label || node.id` are guards the OPTIONAL type currently forces,
 * while a required `label` would let `node.label.trim()` compile against a
 * value that genuinely is absent. So the enforcement has to sit where a node
 * is CONSTRUCTED, where a cast cannot get in front of it.
 *
 * ## What the census found (objectui#6331)
 *
 * Six node literals across five producer call sites, and every one of them
 * already writes a label. But before this file, three of the five were
 * enforced only by ACCIDENT — measured by deleting the `label` line from
 * `insertOnEdge` and from `FlowPreview.handleAddNode` on `origin/main`:
 * vitest green (58/58), `tsc` exit 0, `eslint` exit 0 with zero errors.
 * "They all happen to" and "something prevents otherwise" looked identical
 * from the outside, and only one of them survives an edit.
 *
 * The two that were already enforced stay where they are — this file does not
 * restate them:
 *   - `FlowCanvas.addReviseLoop` — `flow-canvas-seeds.spec-parse.test.tsx`
 *     clicks the real button and full-`safeParse`s the emitted node.
 *   - `buildFlowSkeleton` — its label strings are REQUIRED positional
 *     parameters (omitting one does not type-check, the same discipline
 *     `buildObjectSkeleton`'s `sharingModel` comment sets out), and
 *     `createConformance.test.ts` parses the whole emitted draft. It is
 *     re-asserted below only at node level, because it is the one producer
 *     whose labels come from its CALLER.
 *
 * ## Two halves, and why neither is enough alone
 *
 * 1. **Observed output.** Each producer is driven through the affordance a
 *    user actually clicks, and the node it EMITS is `safeParse`d whole against
 *    the spec. ⛔ Never hand-compose the node and parse that — the sibling
 *    seeds file does exactly that for the palette seeds (`{ id, type, label:
 *    defaultNodeLabel(type), ...defaultNodeExtras(type) }`), which is correct
 *    for ITS subject (the seed extras) and is precisely why it stayed green
 *    through the ablation above: it supplies the label itself, so it can never
 *    see a producer drop one.
 * 2. **A census ratchet over source.** The render half can only speak for the
 *    producers it renders; a producer added tomorrow is invisible to it. The
 *    scan enumerates node literals from source and refuses one that writes no
 *    label, so a NEW producer lands red here rather than at the author's save.
 *
 * ## What the scan can and cannot see
 *
 * It reads the three directories that hold this designer's producers and finds
 * (a) object literals declared AS a flow node type, and (b) object literals
 * inside a `nodes: [ … ]` array. It cannot see an untyped literal assembled
 * elsewhere and cast in — the same blind spot the casts create for the
 * compiler — which is why half 1 exists. `apps/console/src/preview-samples.ts`
 * is deliberately out of the roots: it is read-only gallery data, not an
 * authoring path to save.
 *
 * ## If this fails
 *
 * Write the label at the producer. ⛔ Do not relax the pin, and ⛔ do not
 * "fix" it by making `label` required on a reader type — that is the
 * zero-error no-op objectui#6287 already measured and objectui#6331 re-ruled.
