/**
 * objectui#7923 — `content/docs/api/schema-reference.md`'s `ObjectViewSchema`
 * example may only author `listViews` entry keys that `NamedListView` declares.
 *
 * ## The defect this pin closes
 *
 * The example's `my-deals` entry carried `"default": true`. `NamedListView`
 * (`../objectql.ts`) declares no `default` member and
 * `packages/plugin-view/src/ObjectView.tsx:701` picks the opening view from the
 * NODE-level `ObjectViewSchema.defaultListView`, falling back to the first key —
 * nothing anywhere reads an entry-level flag. So the example taught a key that
 * does not exist, and the view it labelled "default" never opened first, while
 * the SAME page's property table twenty rows below already documented
 * `defaultListView` correctly. The page contradicted itself.
 *
 * ## Why a fixture pin and not a type annotation
 *
 * Annotating the snippet against `ObjectViewSchema` would catch nothing.
 * `BaseSchema` closes with `[key: string]: any` (`../base.ts`), so every
 * invented key type-checks through the index signature — measured directly in
 * objectui#7927 (probe P5: renaming `titleField` to `titleFieldd` inside an
 * annotated block left `check:doc-snippets` at exit 0). The annotation checks a
 * key's TYPE and never its NAME. `NamedListView` is a standalone interface that
 * does NOT extend `BaseSchema`, so its declared members are a genuinely closed
 * list — which is what makes a name-level comparison possible here at all.
 *
 * Nor does any gate cover the block: `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs` compiles
 * `ts` / `tsx` / `typescript` fences only (`TS_FENCE_LANGUAGES`), and this
 * example is a ```json fence, so it is collected and never compiled
 * (objectui#5250). The page is on that gate's covered surface — it is not in
 * `UNGATED_DOCS` — which is precisely why "covered" did not mean "checked".
 *
 * ## Both sides are parsed off disk, never restated here
 *
 * The shape is `packages/plugin-calendar/src/readme-calendar-view-schema.test.ts`
 * (objectui#7925): the declaration is brace-matched out of the interface source
 * and the doc side is parsed out of the markdown on every run, so a red here
 * always means "fix the doc (or the declaration)", never "update the test".
 * Restating the member list in this file would reproduce the original defect one
 * layer up — the doc was itself a confident hand-written restatement.
 * Everything that could make this pin pass vacuously — a moved heading, a
 * renamed interface, a fence that stopped being JSON — throws LOUDLY instead.
 *
 * ⛔ Out of scope, deliberately: the example's `filter` DIALECT (the ObjectQL
 * tuple form `[["owner", "=", …]]` versus the `{ field, operator, value }`
 * objects `packages/plugin-view/README.md` teaches). `NamedListView.filter` is
 * an untyped array so both spellings are declared-legal and this pin cannot and
 * must not adjudicate them; which one `mergeFilterNodes` runs is unmeasured.
 * That is objectui#2890's half. The filter LINE is additionally held verbatim
 * by `object-view-unmirrored-keys-7779.test.ts`.
