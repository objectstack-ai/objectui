 * objectui#7719 — `shortcut` is REFUSED BY NAME on the legacy `AppMenuItem`, on
 * BOTH faces.
 *
 * ⭐ objectui#7469 (maintainer ruling C) retired the app node's `actions` array,
 * `AppAction` and `AppActionSchema`. The ruling below was taken on the app action
 * ITEMS (`AppAction.items`), which were one of the two places this type was
 * authored; the other, `AppComponentSchema.menu`, stays, and so does this
 * refusal. The rows that read the retired action (a non-target `shortcut` on the
 * action itself, and the `items[]` authoring position) went with it; block (d)
 * now takes the refusal through `menu[]`.
 *
 * ## The ruling, quoted rather than paraphrased
 *
 * Director seat decision batch #70, 2026-09-07, maintainer verbatim 「同意」:
 *
 * > The deprecated `AppMenuItem` does not grow a `shortcut` member (option B
 * > refused: zero measured pull, and the type is being retired in favour of
 * > `NavigationItem`); `AppAction.items` is not re-typed to the overlay
 * > `MenuItem` (option C refused, as on #6854). The one change: an authored
 * > `shortcut` on an app action item is **refused by name** on the legacy
 * > mirror (`shortcut?: never` on the TS face, a named refusal on
 * > `MenuItemSchema` in `app.zod.ts`) with a message pointing at
 * > `NavigationItem`, so the key is no longer stripped in silence. ⛔ No read is
 * > re-added in `LayoutRenderer`; the #6854 pin stays as is.
 *
 * ⇒ This file pins the ruling's THREE clauses: the TS `never`, the named mirror
 * refusal, and — block (e) — the untouched renderer contract.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The failure mode here is STRIP, not KEEP — measured, and it differs
 * ## from the family's other retirements
 *
 * objectui#7997 (`DetailViewSchema.related`) recorded that a dropped member key
 * is KEPT: `BaseSchemaCore` ends `.passthrough()` and the TypeScript
 * `BaseSchema` closes with an any-valued index signature. ⛔ That mechanism does
 * NOT apply to this surface and assuming it would misdescribe the change.
 * `MenuItemSchema` is a plain `z.object` under a `z.lazy`, built on no base, and
 * `AppMenuItem` declares no index signature ⇒ an undeclared key is STRIPPED,
 * silently, and never reaches `.data`. Block (c) takes that reading rather than
 * restating it, and the distinction is the point: both mechanisms are a SILENT
 * ACCEPT, so a bare non-declaration refuses nothing either way — but only one of
 * them leaves the value visible afterwards, and here it does not. "Stripped in
 * silence" is the card's own phrase and it is the accurate one.
 *
 * ## Which refusal helper, and why it is a measurement rather than a taste
 *
 * `retirementTombstone()` — `z.never({ error }).optional().describe()`.
 *
 *  - ⛔ NOT `handlerKeyRefusal()`, despite the in-file precedent the sibling
 *    `AppActionSchema.onClick` then carried (retired with its schema by
 *    objectui#7469). Two independent reasons, the second decisive:
 *    its message says JSON has no function value, which is FALSE of a
 *    string-valued key an author can perfectly well write; and its `z.custom`
 *    primitive makes `z.toJSONSchema` THROW. Measured before this change:
 *    `z.toJSONSchema(MenuItemSchema)` SUCCEEDS in both `io` directions while
 *    `z.toJSONSchema(AppActionSchema)` already throws — because of that very
 *    `onClick` arm. Choosing `handlerKeyRefusal` here would have taken
 *    `MenuItemSchema` from representable to throwing. Block (f) pins it.
 *  - ⛔ NOT `aliasKeyRefusal()`: that helper composes "Did you mean `shortcut` →
 *    `<canonical>`?", and there is no canonical member of `MenuItemSchema`
 *    meaning a keyboard shortcut. The remedy here is a different TYPE
 *    (`NavigationItem`), not a sibling spelling, so that helper could only be
 *    made to say something untrue.
 *  - ✅ `retirementTombstone()` is the helper whose own contract is this exact
 *    situation — "a key that stays declared but is unwritable, so an authored
 *    value is REFUSED loudly instead of being silently stripped the way an
 *    undeclared key would be". Declaration history does not separate it from its
 *    siblings: the overlay `MenuItemSchema.type` (objectui#6523) is a
 *    `retirementTombstone` for a spelling that was NEVER declared either, which
 *    is precisely this case.
 *  - ⛔ And not `@objectstack/spec`'s own `retiredKey`, whose describe contract
 *    prefixes `[REMOVED] `; these describe strings are this package's published
 *    metadata.
 *
 * ## Which program checks this file
 *
 * `packages/types`' `type-check` runs THREE programs; this file is in the third
 * (`tsconfig.test.json` — `tsc --noEmit` builds `tsconfig.json`, which excludes
 * `__tests__/` by directory). ⚠️ The type-level rows in block (a) are therefore
 * pinned by `tsc`, ⛔ NOT by vitest, which strips types and would pass them
 * vacuously. Both are run and reported.
