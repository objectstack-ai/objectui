   * re-run calls `setLoading(true)` and `loading` is an early return below),
   * then the expanded rows. Measured on this component before the change,
   * instrumented renderer, one mount per hold: 2 `find` calls with expand
   * sets `[null, ['owner']]`, 1 paint at the readiness predicate and 3 late
   * writes after it, at every hold from +3ms up.

   * ⚠️ The gate below is only safe because this resolution SETTLES ON EVERY
   * EXIT (objectui#7232) — no source, no `getObjectSchema`, no object name,
   * and a read that threw alike. The hand-written effect it replaces returned
   * WITHOUT settling on all four, which cost nothing while nothing waited on
   * it and would hold a gated query open forever.
   *
   * ⛔ `dataSource` is passed unconditionally, NOT `hasInlineData ? undefined
   * : dataSource` the way `ObjectCalendar` and `ObjectGantt` pass it. Those
   * two read metadata only to expand a record query, so an inline data set has
   * nothing to wait for. This component also reads `objectDef.fields` in
   * `effectiveItems` below — option colours and field labels — on the AUTHORED
   * items path, where no query is issued at all. Their recipe would stop that
   * read happening; the conversion is a fetch-sequencing change and must not
   * take a metadata read away from a path that still uses it.
   *
   * The key is `schema.objectName`, which is the object the record query
   * itself names (`dataSource.find(schema.objectName, …)` below) and the one

   * component has no resolved `data` block to read a second name from, and

   *
   * The renderer's gantt branch reads gantt ROWS (`row.items[].startDate`);
   * every item this component composes is a flat feed item with no nested
   * `items`. `calculateDateRange` therefore reduced an empty list, `Math.min()`
   * over it yielded `Infinity`, and `new Date(Infinity).toISOString()` threw
   * `RangeError: Invalid time value` mid-render. The maintainer ruling
   * (2026-08-29) adopted refusing loudly over composing rows from records, so
   * the author gets a diagnostic naming the limitation instead of a crash.
   *
   * ## Three things this condition is careful about
   *
   * 1. `hasAuthoredItems` — a LITERAL gantt is legitimate and untouched. This
   *    component also answers the bare `timeline` key (`view:timeline` in
   *    `./index`; the presentational registration in `./renderer` carries
   *    `skipFallback` so the bare key lands here), and the in-repo catalog
   *    fixture `plugin-timeline/gantt-style-timeline.json` is exactly that:
   *    `variant: 'gantt'` with authored rows. Refusing on `variant` alone would
   *    take it, and every other authored gantt, down with it.
   * 2. `=== 'gantt'`, never "not a feed variant" — an absent `variant` means the
   *    renderer's `vertical` default, not an unsupported one.
   * 3. Placed above the `error` and `loading` returns on purpose. This is a
   *    STATIC authoring fact: it does not depend on the fetch, and no fetch
   *    outcome changes it. Showing a transient network error first would send
   *    the author to debug the wrong layer, and a skeleton would resolve into a
   *    chart that cannot exist.
   *
   * It also settles the ruling's second clause. `resolvedScale` above is a
   * gantt-only axis that this path composes unconditionally; on the gantt
   * variant it used to be configuration for a render that crashed. The author
   * who set it is now told why it has no effect, so it is no longer silently
   * inert here. The composition itself is unchanged for the feed variants,
   * where objectui#6355's pin (`ObjectTimeline.scaleComposition.test.tsx`)
   * requires it to keep happening.

  /**
   * objectui#7459 — REFUSE an object-bound timeline that declares no date axis.
   *
   * The twin of `ObjectGantt`'s screen, which is the settled in-repo shape for
   * this: `getGanttConfig` answers `null` when the schema carries neither a
   * config block nor the required flat props, and the early return names the
   * fields the author has to declare. This is the same answer for the same
   * question, one renderer over.
   *
   * ## Why it can only exist together with the retired floor
   *
   * Until objectui#7459 the resolver above ended in a fabricated literal, so a
   * name ALWAYS resolved and this branch could never have been taken — a
   * refusal screen that is present and unreachable. The maintainer ruling
   * (2026-09-01, objectui#7070, 总监批 #28) ordered the two as one sequence for
   * exactly that reason, and the other order is no better: retiring the floor
   * with no refusal leaves every record reading a key that is not there and
   * bucketing into "No date". Neither half is observable alone; the pin
   * (`ObjectTimeline.absentDateAxisRefusal-7459.test.tsx`) measures the pairing
   * rather than trusting it.
   *
   * ## Three things this condition is careful about
   *
   * 1. `hasAuthoredItems` — the same test the #6655 refusal directly above
   *    makes, and for the same reason. An AUTHORED item carries its own `time`
   *    / `startDate`; no field NAME is read for it, so a literal timeline needs
   *    no date binding and must not be refused for lacking one. The in-repo
   *    catalog fixtures (`vertical-timeline.json`, `horizontal-timeline.json`,
   *    `gantt-style-timeline.json`) are all exactly that.
   * 2. It keys on the START axis alone. `endDateField` falls back to it, so a
   *    view that declared only an end date has declared no axis to lay events
   *    on — the same judgement `getGanttConfig` makes when it refuses a
   *    half-declared gantt.
   * 3. Placed with the #6655 refusal, above `error` and `loading`, because it
   *    is the same KIND of fact: a static authoring fact that no fetch outcome
   *    changes. A skeleton that resolves into a refusal, or a network error
   *    shown first, would both send the author to debug the wrong layer.
   *
   * It sits BELOW the variant refusal deliberately. A composed gantt cannot be
   * drawn here at all, so "this path does not render gantt" is the more useful
   * first sentence than "declare a date field" for a chart that would be
   * refused either way.
