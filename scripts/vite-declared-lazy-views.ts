/**
 * Keeps `AppContent`'s `lazy()` view declarations and the console's EAGER
 * CLOSURE in agreement — by making the laziness real where it can be, and by
 * failing the build when the two drift apart (objectui#6535).
 *
 * ## The measurement this exists for
 *
 * `packages/app-shell/src/console/AppContent.tsx` declares eight route views
 * with `lazy(() => import('../views/<View>.js'))`. Measured on `ece68882` from
 * `apps/console/dist/eager-closure.json` (`files[]` IS the eager set) and
 * cross-checked by an independent BFS over the emitted chunks' static imports,
 * SIX of those eight were in the eager closure anyway:
 *
 * | declared `lazy()`   | eager before | eager after | why it was eager        |
 * |---------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------------|
 * | `DashboardView`     | yes          | NO          | barrel re-export ONLY   |
 * | `PageView`          | yes          | NO          | barrel re-export ONLY   |
 * | `SearchResultsPage` | yes          | NO          | barrel re-export ONLY   |
 * | `RecordDetailView`  | yes          | yes         | real static edge        |
 * | `RecordFormPage`    | yes          | yes         | chunk co-tenancy        |
 * | `ReportView`        | yes          | yes         | chunk co-tenancy        |
 * | `ComponentNavView`  | no           | no          | never re-exported       |
 * | `ObjectDataPage`    | no           | no          | never re-exported       |
 *
 * The count of six is right and its MECHANISM is right for only three of them.
 * That correction is the whole design of this file, so it is stated rather than
 * implied: removing the barrel edge freed exactly the three views that had no
 * other reason to be eager, and the eager closure moved 3237.0 KB -> 3231.7 KB
 * gzipped (-5,367 bytes, 52 -> 49 eager chunks of 508) as read from
 * `pnpm check:eager-closure`. The other three are held by defects the barrel has
 * nothing to do with, they are worth 53.8 KB gzipped between them, and no import
 * spelling repairs any of them — see {@link DECLARED_LAZY_VIEWS_STILL_EAGER}.
 *
 * ## Defect 1 — the barrel re-export nobody can tree-shake (three views)
 *
 * `packages/app-shell/src/index.ts` re-exports the views from the package
 * barrel (`export { RecordFormPage, ... } from './views/index.js'`), and the
 * console's entry imports that barrel statically (`apps/console/src/main.tsx`,
 * and ~30 other console modules). A named re-export is an ordinary static edge,
 * so the split chunk stays statically reachable from the entry even though the
 * only ROUTING reference to it is a `lazy()` import.
 *
 * Tree-shaking should have dropped those re-exports — nothing in the eager graph
 * uses the bindings. It cannot, because `@object-ui/app-shell` publishes no
 * `sideEffects` field, so every bundler must assume every module in the
 * re-export chain might do something on import and keeps them all.
 *
 * The fix is to tell the CONSOLE's build what is true of these specific
 * modules: they are pure React components, so `moduleSideEffects: false`. That
 * was deliberately narrower than adding `"sideEffects"` to
 * `packages/app-shell/package.json`, which is the general fix and was reserved
 * as a published-contract decision rather than taken in-lane.
 *
 * ⚠️ That decision has since been taken (objectui#6683, maintainer ruling of
 * 2026-08-29): the package now declares a precise `sideEffects` ARRAY, guarded
 * by `scripts/check-side-effects-array.mjs`. `"sideEffects": false` stays
 * disproven and is NOT what shipped — measured, it silently DROPS three real
 * SDUI widget registrations (`mcp:connect-agent`, `cloud:onboarding-next`,
 * `cloud:ai-model-status`, all registered through bare side-effect imports in
 * the barrel). The ARRAY names those modules, and
 * `scripts/check-sdui-registration-pins.mjs` weighs the built console for them.
 *
 * This plugin is NOT made redundant by that. It is scoped to AppContent's
 * declared-lazy route views, which are pure components with no registration of
 * their own, so the package array does not — and must not — name them; the
 * console-local declaration is what keeps them shakeable, and the ledger below
 * is what keeps the agreement honest in both directions.
 *
 * ## Defect 2 — edges the barrel has nothing to do with (three views)
 *
 * `RecordDetailView` is eager for an honest reason and stays eager:
 * `packages/app-shell/src/views/ObjectView.tsx` imports it statically, and
 * `ObjectView` is in AppContent's own "eagerly loaded — always needed" block.
 * Its `lazy()` is defeated by a genuine dependency, not by a barrel. It is
 * therefore PINNED in {@link DECLARED_LAZY_VIEWS_STILL_EAGER} rather than
 * quietly declared pure — and it is not declared pure for a second, independent
 * reason: it carries a bare `import './record-approvals-renderer.js'`, so the
 * claim would be false.
 *
 * `RecordFormPage` and `ReportView` are eager for a third reason, and it is the
 * one no `grep` over the source will show: CHUNK CO-TENANCY. Rolldown emits each
 * of them in a chunk it shares with a module that IS eagerly used, so the whole
 * chunk is eager and the view's bytes ride along even with no import edge to the
 * view itself. Both are pinned with the co-tenant named.
 *
 * ## Defect 3 — the surfaces this file used to look away from (objectui#6681)
 *
 * AppContent declares `lazy()` for more than the eight single-file views, and
 * objectui#6535 deliberately parsed only those: a directory barrel
 * (`../views/metadata-admin/index.js`, six declarations), a sibling directory
 * (`./marketplace/*.js`, three) and a package (`@object-ui/plugin-designer`,
 * three). Measured on `b98352a15` from `apps/console/dist/eager-closure.json`
 * and the emitted chunks' own module lists, three of those four surfaces were
 * eager and worth 182,134 bytes gzipped — 5.6% of a 3180.2 KB closure, and more
 * than four times its 42.5 KB of headroom:
 *
 * | chunk                      | gz eager | mechanism                          |
 * |----------------------------|----------|------------------------------------|
 * | `metadata-admin`           | 172,651  | real static edges — FIXED, #6776   |
 * | `MarketplacePackagePage`   |    7,647 | chunk co-tenancy — FIXED           |
 * | `MarketplaceInstalledPage` |    1,836 | chunk co-tenancy — FIXED           |
 * | `MarketplacePage`          |        0 | already lazy (the control)         |
 *
 * The two marketplace chunks were held by objectui#6680's mechanism, not by an
 * import of the page: rolldown had put `MarketplacePackagePage.tsx` in a chunk
 * with `components/SuggestedBindingsPanel.tsx` (which eager
 * `views/studio-design/StudioDesignSurface.tsx` imports statically) and
 * `MarketplaceInstalledPage.tsx` in a chunk with
 * `console/marketplace/InstalledListWidget.tsx` (which the package barrel
 * bare-imports for its SDUI registration). `MarketplacePage.tsx` had no eager
 * co-tenant and was already lazy — the control that makes the mechanism legible.
 * The repair is the `app-shell-eager-leaves` group in
 * `apps/console/vite.config.ts`, which isolates the co-tenants; the eager
 * closure moved 3180.2 KB -> 3171.5 KB (-8,888 bytes, 48 -> 45 eager chunks).
 *
 * ⚠️ The opposite grouping was tried FIRST and measured WORSE, which is why the
 * group names the leaves and not the pages: a `marketplace-routes` group over
 * the three declared-lazy pages became an attractor for 47 modules — including
 * `runtime-config.ts`, `providers/MetadataProvider.tsx` and
 * `@object-ui/plugin-form` — and emitted a 44 KB EAGER chunk, because the same
 * bare-imported `InstalledListWidget.tsx` got swept into it. Net -1,697 bytes
 * against -8,888, and three other lazy boundaries destroyed. A chunk group is
 * not a laziness declaration; it decides co-tenancy, and co-tenancy runs both
 * ways.
 *
 * ## Why a ledger, and why drift fails in BOTH directions
 *
 * A one-off measurement does not stop the next barrel re-export from undoing
 * this. Neither does a check that only fails when a view goes eager: the
 * dangerous reading here is ZERO, exactly as in
 * `scripts/vite-ineffective-dynamic-imports.ts`. So:
 *
 *  - **unpinned** — a declared-`lazy()` view found in the eager closure that
 *    this ledger does not know about. That is a NEW regression; the build stops
 *    and names the view.
 *  - **missing** — a pinned view that is NOT in the eager closure any more.
 *    Either someone fixed the static edge (record the win: delete the line, say
 *    so in the PR) or this walk has gone blind.
 *
 * Two counter-probes guard the walk itself, because both halves above are
 * statements about a SET that a broken matcher empties silently:
 *
 *  1. Every declared view must be found in SOME chunk, eager or lazy. A view
 *     that matches nothing at all means the module-id matcher stopped matching,
 *     not that the bundle improved.
 *  2. `ObjectView` — imported statically by AppContent's always-needed block —
 *     must be found EAGER. It is the positive control in the same query shape:
 *     if the eager walk cannot see a module that is eager by construction, its
 *     zeroes are not measurements.

 *
 * ONE entry stands, and it does not stand for the barrel re-export

 *
 *  - `packages/app-shell/src/views/RecordDetailView.tsx` — a real static edge.
 *    `packages/app-shell/src/views/ObjectView.tsx` imports it by name, and
 *    `ObjectView` sits in AppContent's own "eagerly loaded — always needed"
 *    block. Splitting it would mean giving `ObjectView` a lazy boundary.
 *
 * ## `views/metadata-admin/index.ts` was the third removal — objectui#6776
 *
 * It was the LARGEST single entry this ledger ever carried: 172,945 bytes
 * gzipped over 144 modules, 5.3% of the eager closure, the target of SIX
 * `lazy()` declarations in AppContent that deferred nothing. Two static edges
 * held it, both measured from the emitted chunk's module list (objectui#6681):
 *
 *   1. `packages/app-shell/src/index.ts` — the package barrel re-exported 25
 *      runtime values from it (`registerMetadataPreview`, `useMetadataClient`,
 *      …; the earlier note here said eleven, which counted only part of the
 *      list and omitted the 11 type-only names that carry no edge at all —
 *      corrected by objectui#6785). The console's entry imports that barrel.
 *   2. `packages/app-shell/src/services/builtinComponents.tsx` — which the
 *      barrel BARE-imports for its ComponentRegistry registrations, and which
 *      imported `MetadataDirectoryPage` and `MetadataResourceRouter` from this
 *      module BY VALUE. A registry entry that names a component must hold the
 *      component.
 *
 * The note that stood here said neither edge was removable inside a bundling
 * change, and that was right — the repair was NOT a bundling change. Under the
 * maintainer ruling of 2026-08-30 (objectui#6776), three things moved together:
 *
 *   - the five top-level registrations (`registerBuiltinAnchors`,
 *     `registerDefaultMetadataSchemas`, `registerDatasourceResource`,
 *     `registerBuiltinPreviews`, `registerBuiltinInspectors`) moved to
 *     `views/metadata-admin/register-builtins.ts`, bare-imported by the PACKAGE
 *     ENTRY, so they stay exactly as eager as they were while the page barrel
 *     stops being side-effectful. `@object-ui/app-shell`'s `sideEffects` array
 *     names the new leaf instead of the barrel;
 *   - the package barrel's 25 runtime re-exports now name the LEAF modules,
 *     same names and same types, which removes edge 1; and
 *   - `builtinComponents.tsx` registers the two pages as `lazy()` values, each
 *     behind its own `Suspense` inside the registration value, which removes
 *     edge 2 without touching `registerAppComponent`'s signature.
 *
 * ⚠️ The `lazy()` in `builtinComponents.tsx` is the half that looks sufficient
 * and is not. Measured on `fab4802e3` with ONLY that half applied: the eager
 * closure went UP by 211 bytes, the `metadata-admin` chunk went up by 396, the
 * eager chunk count did not move, the chunk stayed EAGER — and the build exited
 * 0 with this plugin printing "2 eager, all pinned" and
 * `scripts/vite-ineffective-dynamic-imports.ts` printing its usual 43, because
 * neither can see a static edge that lives in another module. That trap is
 * written up beside the code in `builtinComponents.tsx`.
 *
 * Read that 211 as a magnitude, not a direction: an INDEPENDENT rebuild of the
 * same variant measured the closure delta at -7 bytes. Both figures stand as
 * what their run measured, and the disagreement is the point — the delta is
 * small and sensitive to the byte-form of the edit, so its sign is not a
 * finding. The finding is the pair that reproduced on both rebuilds: the chunk
 * stayed EAGER and the eager chunk count did not move (45 of 513).
 *
 * ⛔ What has NOT changed: the registrations in `register-builtins.ts` are
 * still load-bearing and still unshakeable. {@link declaredSideEffectful} — not
 * {@link bareSideEffectImport}, which returns `null` for a top-level CALL —
 * is the guard that refuses to declare their module pure, and it now reads
 * `register-builtins.ts` out of the package's own array. Moving the bare import
 * back onto the page barrel would re-arm the whole defect under a new name.
 *
 * objectui#11939 step 2 took two of the five out of that module: the built-in
 * previews and inspectors are registered by `register-builtin-designers.ts`,
 * which the package entry loads with a dynamic `import()` and whose exported
 * function its `.then` calls. That module registers nothing at load time, so
 * the array does not name it and neither guard here is involved; the three
 * registrations whose registries are not observable stay in
 * `register-builtins.ts`, eager as before.
 *
 * ## Two entries were REMOVED here BEFORE that, and both removals are wins
 *
 * `RecordFormPage` and `ReportView` were pinned for a third reason, the one no
 * `grep` over the source shows: CHUNK CO-TENANCY (objectui#6680). Rolldown
 * emitted each of them in a chunk shared with a module that IS eagerly used —
 * `providers/expressionUser.ts` for the first, `views/RuntimeDraftBar.tsx` for
 * the second — so the whole chunk was eager and the view's bytes rode along
 * with no import edge to the view itself.
 *
 * objectui#6683 declared `"sideEffects"` on `@object-ui/app-shell` as a precise
 * ARRAY, which makes those co-tenant modules shakeable in their own right; the
 * chunks they anchored stopped being eager and both views fell out of the
 * closure. The `missing` half of this ledger fired on that build and named both
 * views by path, which is what a recorded win looks like here — the lines are
 * deleted because the build said so, not because the walk was assumed healthy.
 *
 * ⚠️ Deleting a line is a MEASUREMENT, never a repair. Counter-probe 1 below
 * (every declared view must be found in SOME chunk) is what separates "the view
 * became lazy" from "the matcher stopped matching", and it ran green on the
 * same build.
