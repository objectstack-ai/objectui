/**
 * When an `en` string CHANGES, the other nine packs must change with it.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-i18n-en-drift.mjs   (also `pnpm check:i18n-drift`)
 * Exit: 0 = every changed `en` value was followed (or waived), 1 = it was not
 *
 * ## The gap this closes (objectui#3650)
 *
 * Three i18n gates already run on every PR and all three read only KEYS:
 *
 *   - `packages/i18n/src/__tests__/all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` — every pack
 *     defines every `en` key and no key `en` lacks. A **key-set** invariant.
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` (objectui#3530) — every key a
 *     `t()` call site asks for exists in `en`. Also a **key** invariant.
 *   - that gate's baseline ratchet — same, one level down.
 *
 * None of them can see a VALUE go stale, and two shipped defects proved it:
 *
 *   - objectui#3582: `console.objectView.systemViewReadonly` — `en` was changed
 *     from "duplicate to customize" to "read-only"; eight packs kept serving the
 *     old English sentence.
 *   - objectui#3625: `view.readonlyTooltip` — same `en` edit, same eight packs,
 *     except here the packs held **idiomatic native-script translations of the
 *     retired sentence**. Native script, mutually distinct, full key parity,
 *     correct placeholders: every mechanical judgement about the value itself
 *     was green, and stayed green. objectui#3582's suggested "no ASCII English
 *     in a non-Latin pack" probe would not have seen it either — measured,
 *     in PR #3642.
 *
 * The second case is the one that fixes the design. No gate can decide whether
 * a Japanese sentence still MEANS what the English one now means; asking for
 * that is asking for a translator. What a gate can decide is the **event**: the
 * `en` value for this key changed in this PR and the nine translations did not.
 * That is the invariant both defects violated at birth, and it is checkable
 * exactly once — in the PR that edits `en`, while the author still knows what
 * the sentence is supposed to say. A day later it is archaeology.
 *
 * ## What is compared, and against what
 *
 * The pack sources at the **merge base** of `HEAD` and `origin/main` versus the
 * pack sources at `HEAD` (or the working tree). Merge base, not `origin/main`'s
 * tip: a branch must answer for the `en` edits IT made, never for edits that
 * landed on `main` after it forked.
 *
 * A key is "drifted" when it exists in `en` on BOTH sides with DIFFERENT values.
 * For each drifted key, each of the nine packs must also show a different value
 * across the same two commits. Granularity is the key — not the sentence, not
 * the namespace, not the file. Two facts follow, and both are deliberate:
 *
 *   - **A key ADDED to or REMOVED from `en` is not this gate's business.** That
 *     is a key-set change and `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` already fails on
 *     it, in both directions. Reporting it here would double-report one defect.
 *   - **A pack that does not define the key is skipped for that key**, and the
 *     skips are counted and printed. The four `console.ai.*` outbound-message
 *     keys are absent from eight packs BY DESIGN (see
 *     `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` and `outbound-agent-messages.test.ts`);
 *     demanding those packs "follow" a key they must not define would be this
 *     gate contradicting the one that owns key sets.
 *
 * ## Typography is NOT exempt
 *
 * Changing `en` from `Save` to `Save.` fails exactly like a rewrite. Two
 * reasons, in this order:
 *
 *   1. There is no honest mechanical test for "this edit did not change the
 *      meaning". A punctuation-only heuristic is a semantic claim wearing a
 *      regex, and objectui#3625 is the case study in what those cost: every
 *      cheap judgement about that value was green while the sentence was wrong.
 *   2. The waiver ledger below already IS the exemption channel, and it makes
 *      the claim a person signs rather than a rule the script guesses. A
 *      typography-only edit takes one ledger entry naming the new text.
 *
 * Measured before choosing, not assumed: replaying this gate over all 21 commits
 * that have touched `en.ts` since the packs entered this repo turns up exactly
 * ONE commit that changes an `en` value at all (0e50440e8, three keys), and all
 * 27 of its pack/key pairs followed — green, correctly. So the observable cost
 * of refusing an exemption is, on this history, zero commits: there is no
 * typography-only churn here for a carve-out to spare. See the PR for
 * objectui#3650 for the full replay.
 *
 * ## Why it lands green, and why that is not an empty green
 *
 * Neither defect's originating commit is reachable from here. The ten packs
 * entered this repository whole at 30ac2e1ee, and at that very commit `en`
 * already said "read-only" while `ja` already said the duplicate-to-customize
 * sentence — both drifts arrived pre-broken, from wherever the files were moved
 * in. The replay over everything since is green because in that window exactly
 * one commit changed an `en` value and it did the right thing.
 *
 * So this gate cannot be validated by history, and the honest consequence is
 * that its acceptance corpus is IMPLANTED rather than observed:
 * `check-i18n-en-drift.test.ts` rebuilds the objectui#3625 commit that must have
 * existed — `en` moved to the read-only sentence, the eight packs left holding
 * their translations of the retired one — in a throwaway git repo, and asserts
 * this gate names both keys and all eight packs. That, plus the exit-code tests
 * around it, is the evidence that the green above is a measurement and not an
 * empty comparison.
 *
 * ## The waiver ledger
 *
 * `scripts/i18n-en-drift-baseline.json`. It ships EMPTY, and unlike
 * objectui#3547's baseline it can never hold a backlog, because this gate has
 * no backlog to hold: it judges an event in a diff, not a state in the tree.
 * There is no "the packs are currently 258 keys behind" to write down here —
 * whether today's `ja` sentence still matches today's `en` sentence is the
 * semantic question no gate can answer, and pretending otherwise is how
 * objectui#3625 stayed green.
 *
 * An entry is `{ "<key>": { "en": "<the NEW en text>", "reason": …, "issue": … } }`
 * and it is checked against the tree on EVERY run, diff or no diff:
 *
 *   - the key must still exist in `en`;
 *   - `entry.en` must still equal `en`'s CURRENT value for that key.
 *
 * That transcription is the whole mechanism. A waiver can only be written by
 * someone who already made the edit (they have to copy the new sentence into
 * the ledger, where a reviewer reads it next to the reason), it waives that one
 * sentence and no other, and the NEXT time the key's `en` value changes the
 * entry no longer matches and the build fails until someone deletes or renews
 * it. Waivers expire by themselves; they do not accumulate into an allowlist.
 *
 * A waiver that fires no finding on a given run is NOT an error — after the
 * waiving PR merges, every later run sees an empty diff, and failing them all
 * would turn one PR's escape hatch into everyone else's red build. The ratchet
 * on quantity is a pin in `scripts/__tests__/check-i18n-en-drift.test.ts`: the
 * ledger's entry count has a ceiling in that test, so growing the ledger means
 * editing a test that says so, in the PR that grows it.
 *
 * ## Why the packs are parsed from source rather than imported
 *
 * The "before" side is a blob inside git, not a file on disk, and the ten packs
 * are 1.5 MB of TypeScript. `git show <base>:<path>` hands us the text and the
 * TypeScript AST turns it into `key -> string` with no build step, no loader,
 * and no temp files — the same trick, for the same reason, as `collectEnKeys`
 * in `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs`. `check-i18n-en-drift.test.ts`
 * pins the extraction against the real module vitest evaluates, so the parser
 * cannot drift from the packs it claims to read. Anything the parser does not
 * understand THROWS rather than being skipped: a silently dropped subtree would
 * make this gate green over exactly the keys it stopped reading.

// -- the designer table, a SECOND population (objectui#8834) ------------------

/**
 * `packages/app-shell/src/views/metadata-admin/i18n.ts` carries the Studio
 * designer's own module-local string tables, and until objectui#8834 they were
 * out of every i18n gate's population — including this one, whose header says
 * so above: "This table is not one of them".
 *
 * That blind spot is this gate's exact shape of defect. objectui#8413 changed
 * an English help string that said something untrue; the Chinese row said the
 * same untrue thing, and nothing would have failed had the author fixed only
 * the English one. The dispatch that ordered that fix asserted this gate would
 * name the changed value. It could not — the table is not a locale pack.
 *
 * ## Why a SEPARATE population and not an eleventh pack
 *
 * The table is module-local by deliberate design (see the header of
 * `check-i18n-dead-keys.mjs` for why), and folding it into `LOCALES` would put
 * it in front of `all-locales-key-parity`, `check-i18n-call-site-keys` and the
 * `--min-keys` floor, none of which can read it. It gets its own `before`/
 * `after` pair, its own single follower, and its own ledger section instead;
 * `findDrift` is reused unchanged.
 *
 * ## Why the 55 one-sided keys need no ledger here
 *
 * `ENGINE_STRINGS_ZH` carries 55 keys `ENGINE_STRINGS_EN` deliberately lacks.
 * This gate never sees them: it iterates the `en` side, and its per-key rule —
 * "a pack that does not define the key is skipped for that key" — already
 * handles the reverse direction. Key-set asymmetry is not this gate's business,
 * exactly as stated for the packs; `check-i18n-designer-table-parity.mjs` owns
 * that state invariant.
