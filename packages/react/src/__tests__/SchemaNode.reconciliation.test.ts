/**
 * One `SchemaNode` (objectui#4580).
 *
 * Two packages published a type of this name and they were not the same type:
 *
 *   `@object-ui/core`  `interface SchemaNode { type: string; … [key: string]: any }`
 *   `@object-ui/types` `type SchemaNode = BaseSchema | string | number | boolean | null | undefined`
 *
 * Both are exported under one name from packages the same consumers import
 * together, so which declaration a call site got depended on which package it
 * happened to import from. #4548's option-A canary measured **19 of 35** errors
 * as exactly this collision. PR #4578 sidestepped it — `SchemaRenderer` states
 * its own component-level union instead of picking a side — and left the
 * reconciliation to this card.
 *
 * `@object-ui/types`' union wins: it is the spec of record (its own doc comment
 * names `'Plain string'` a valid node), and it is the side the measured
 * collisions resolve toward. Core's hand-declared interface becomes a
 * re-export, so there is exactly one declaration left to disagree with.
 *
 * ## Why this file lives in `@object-ui/react`
 *
 * It has to be a CONSUMER of both packages, resolving each through
 * `node_modules` — that is the only place the collision is observable. This
 * package's `tsconfig.test.json` sets `"paths": {}` precisely so `@object-ui/*`
 * resolve through the workspace dependency's built `.d.ts` rather than pulling
 * sibling sources in as program inputs, which is what makes the two `dist`
 * identities in the error text below real.
 *
 * ## Predictions, written before the first run (red-first)
 *
 * Against `origin/main` (`92250d648`), i.e. with core's interface still
 * hand-declared, `tsc -p packages/react/tsconfig.test.json` must report:
 *
 *   1. `assertion1` — `Equal< CoreSchemaNode, TypesSchemaNode >` resolves
 *      `false`, so `Expect< … >` fails its `extends true` constraint (TS2344).
 *   2. `acceptsCoreNode(typesNode)` — TS2322, naming both `dist` identities:
 *      `Type 'import(".../packages/types/dist/base").SchemaNode' is not
 *      assignable to type 'import(".../packages/core/dist/types/index").SchemaNode'`.
 *   3. `plainStringIsANode` — a plain string is a node per types' doc comment,
 *      and core's interface requires `type: string`, so this too is TS2322.
 *
 * After the fix all three compile clean. The assertions are deliberately
 * type-level and INVARIANT (`Equal`, not `extends`): a one-way `extends` — or a
 * bare `satisfies` — would stay green if core's declaration were merely made
 * assignable rather than made THE SAME TYPE, which is the whole defect.

 *

 * than stylistic. `typesNode` and `acceptsCoreNode` are `declare`d — they are
 * type-level fictions with no runtime existence — so a top-level
 * `export const coreNodeHoldsTypesNode: CoreSchemaNode = typesNode;` type-checks
 * exactly the same but **throws `ReferenceError: typesNode is not defined` the
 * moment vitest imports the module**, failing the whole suite before a single
 * case runs. Round 1 of this card only ever type-checked this file (the
 * reconciliation was withdrawn before it reached a vitest run), so the defect
 * was latent in the preserved pin and surfaced the first time both checkers saw
 * it. A function body is checked by `tsc` just as thoroughly and never
 * executes, which is what lets one file be read by both tools.
