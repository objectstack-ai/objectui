/**
 * objectui#8920 — a `format`-hinted textual column must reach its renderer
 * through EVERY path `ObjectGrid` can pick, not just the one that happened to
 * apply the published two-step.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `@object-ui/fields` publishes `getCellRenderer(resolveCellRendererType(f))`.
 * Skip the second step and a `text` + `format: 'phone'` column resolves to
 * `TextCellRenderer`, which destructures only `value` and therefore cannot read
 * `field.format`. Nothing throws, nothing warns: the cell just renders plain
 * truncated text where a `tel:` anchor belongs. Six sites in `ObjectGrid.tsx`
 * resolved a renderer with three conventions and only ONE of them ran the
 * promotion, so which of the grid's paths honoured an author's `format` hint
 * depended on how the columns had been declared.
 *
 * ## Why a RENDERING test, and why one case per path
 *
 * `getCellRenderer(field.type)` type-checks — `field.type` is a `string` and
 * the parameter is a `string` — so every type-level and doc-level gate reads
 * the broken sites green. **A green that cannot go red on this defect is not
 * evidence.** The only oracle that can fail is rendered output: which renderer
 * drew the cell, observed as whether a `tel:` anchor exists.
 *
 * And one case is not enough. A single case through one path proves the shared
 * helper works; it says nothing about whether the divergence is gone. The
 * divergence IS the defect, so the population — every path — is the subject,
 * and each path gets its own case.
 *
 * ## The control, and why it is phone-SHAPED
 *
 * Every case carries an unhinted control column, `note`, whose value is a
 * second, DIFFERENT phone number. So:
 *
 *   - the hinted assertion is `a[href="tel:<hinted>"]` — present;
 *   - the control assertion is `a[href="tel:<control>"]` — absent, while the
 *     control's text still renders.
 *
 * A control holding a non-phone string would only show that the fix did not
 * reach it. This one shows the promotion is driven by the DECLARED `format`
 * and not by the value's shape, which is the other way this could have been
 * "fixed" and would have been worse.
 *
 * ## Reaching each path (measured, not presumed)
 *
 * `generateColumns()` picks its source with `normalizeColumns(schema.columns)`
 * first, then an inline-data branch, then the object-schema branch:
 *
 *   A  `columns` as objects   — `columns: [{ field }]`
 *   B  `columns` as strings   — `columns: ['work_phone']`
 *   C  inline-data projection — no `columns`, `fields` present, `data` inline
 *                               (`fields` is what keeps `rowKeysWouldOutrank
 *                               SchemaPolicy` false once the schema lands)
 *   D  object-schema policy   — no `columns`, no `fields`, rows handed down
 *   E  record-detail panel    — `renderRecordDetail` -> `renderFieldValue`
 *   P  compound-cell prefix   — `col.prefix.type === 'badge'`
 *
 * ## PREDICTED before running, on the pre-fix tree: 4 red, 2 green-both-sides
 *
 * A and P were ALREADY correct — A is the one site that ran the promotion, and
 * P asks for a fixed registry key with no field type to promote. Their cases
 * are PINS (must-not-change), not evidence that anything was fixed; they are
 * here because a shared helper that silently changed either of them would be a
 * regression this file has to catch. B, C, D and E are the genuinely red ones.
