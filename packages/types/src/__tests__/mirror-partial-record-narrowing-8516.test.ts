 * objectui#8516 + objectui#8556 — two mirrors keyed by their own declaration's
 * vocabulary instead of by `string`.
 *
 * ## The class, and why it is one card's worth of repair twice
 *
 * A mirror restates a TS declaration by hand. Both keys below restated a CLOSED
 * key set as an OPEN one, so the validator that judges authored JSON accepted a
 * spelling the published types refuse:
 *
 * | key | mirror was | declaration |
 * | :-- | :--------- | :---------- |
 * | `GridSchema.columns` | `z.record(z.string(), z.number())` | `number` OR a partial breakpoint map |
 * | `ReportComponentSchema.exportConfigs` | `z.record(z.string(), ReportExportConfigSchema)` | a partial per-format map |
 *
 * `@object-ui/cli`'s `validate` / `check` are the real consumers of these
 * mirrors, so on the primary authoring surface of a server-driven-UI product a
 * grid keyed `{ xxl: 6 }` passed validation and then rendered at its default
 * column count with no error and no warning — objectui#7097's defect surviving
 * on the face objectui#8505 did not touch.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The spelling that looks right and is not
 *
 * `z.record(z.enum([…]), …)` — MEASURED on zod 4.4.3, the version this package
 * depends on, and re-measured here as an executable pin rather than quoted:
 *
 * ```
 * z.record(z.enum(SIX), z.number()).safeParse({ md: 2 })
 *   -> success: false, five `invalid_type` issues, one per ABSENT member
 * ```
 *
 * zod 4's plain `z.record` over an enum key REQUIRES every member. So that
 * spelling refuses the partial map both declarations explicitly invite — it
 * clears the `WiderThanDeclared` reading and produces the opposite divergence
 * on the same pair. `z.partialRecord` is the spelling that does not.
 *
 * The pins that catch the overshoot are `_columnsFace` / `_columnsIsPartial` and
 * `_exportConfigsIsPartial` below (compile time — each compares a WHOLE map type,
 * ⛔ never a `keyof`, which erases the optionality that IS the overshoot) and the
 * accepting rows in each `describe` (run time), plus the ledger reconciliation in the sibling
 * `zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`, which is the file-level instrument objectui#8556
 * ruled this must be pinned against rather than against an accept set alone.
 *
 * ## Which program checks the type-level half
 *
 * `packages/types`' `type-check` runs THREE programs and this file is in the
 * third, `tsconfig.test.json` — `tsc --noEmit` builds `tsconfig.json`, which
 * excludes `__tests__/` by directory, so it reads none of the `Eq` constants
 * below and is a FALSE GREEN for them. Confirmed with `--listFiles`, not
 * assumed (the same trap `grid-columns-breakpoint-narrowing-8505.test.ts`
 * records, and objectui#8342 before it).
