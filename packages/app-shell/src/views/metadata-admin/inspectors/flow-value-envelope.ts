/**
 * flow-value-envelope — the `value`-role slot of a flow node's config map
 * (objectui#7588, the Studio half of objectstack#14149 ruling A).
 *
 * The `assignment` node's `assignments` map takes two authoring forms per
 * value: a plain string, which is `{token}` flow interpolation, and a CEL value
 * envelope `{ dialect: 'cel', source }`, which the expression engine evaluates,
 * so the CEL stdlib (`joinNonEmpty`, …) becomes authorable from metadata. The
 * two are told apart by SHAPE, never by a mode key: an object naming a
 * `dialect` is an envelope, and everything else keeps the meaning it always
 * had. That is why a plain string is never rewritten into an envelope here.
 *
 * Every decision below is read from `@objectstack/spec/automation`, never
 * restated:
 *
 * - WHICH slot takes an envelope: the expression ledger
 *   (`FLOW_NODE_EXPRESSION_PATHS`), whose `value`-role entries name a node type
 *   and a `KEY.*` path. The key/value editor serves many other maps (an
 *   action's `params`, a request's `headers`, a subflow's `input` …), where an
 *   object naming a `dialect` is just data, so the affordance is offered only
 *   where the ledger declares the role.
 * - WHAT is an envelope: `isExpressionEnvelopeShaped`, the predicate the
 *   ledger resolver and the executor both use.
 * - WHEN an envelope is refused: `AssignmentValueSchema`, whose issues lead
 *   with `ASSIGNMENT_VALUE_ENVELOPE_REFUSAL`. The editor shows those messages
 *   verbatim beside the cell, so the author reads the same sentence
 *   `registerFlow` would refuse the flow with.
 * - The one dialect the slot evaluates: read off
 *   `AssignmentExpressionValueSchema`'s own `dialect` literal.
 *
 * The map is the only shape that reads an envelope as an expression. The
 * legacy `assignments: [{ variable, value }]` array is read-compatible but
 * undeclared, and an envelope-shaped object there is a literal
 * (`ASSIGNMENT_ARRAY_FORM_PRESCRIPTION` says so in the spec's own words).
