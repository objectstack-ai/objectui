/**
 * `record:details` — who owns the empty-section default (objectui#7064,
 * objectui#7129 Q2-C, objectui#8603).
 *
 * TWO DISJOINT DOMAINS, and every case below belongs to exactly one:
 *
 *   - the EMPTY ROWS of a section that still has a filled row — owned by
 *     `DetailSection`'s auto-hide heuristic and the reader's "Show N empty
 *     fields" toggle, with no authored override in either polarity
 *     (objectui#7129 Q2-C, which objectui#8603 leaves untouched);
 *   - an ALL-EMPTY section — owned by the authored `hideEmpty`, hiding by
 *     renderer default, `false` keeping the heading and the label skeleton.
 *
 * The heuristic requires `filledCount > 0` and `hideEmpty` applies only where
 * there is none, so no fixture can be governed by both.
 *
 * ## Why this file has been rewritten twice
 *
 * `RecordDetailsRenderer` used to map every authored section with
 * `hideEmpty: s.hideEmpty ?? true`. That forced default made an unauthored
 * section indistinguishable from an authored `true` at every later read, so
 * every application had to hand-write `hideEmpty: false` per section to stop a
 * hand-created record collapsing to a two-row body — per-app tax for a
 * platform concern (maintainer ruling 2026-08-31, objectui#7064), and the
 * force went.
 *
 * That pass-through then measured the key on all four of its contracts and
 * found three answers (objectui#7129): `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0 REFUSED
 * `hideEmpty` on a `record:details` section, so on any spec-validated page the
 * "author escape hatch" existed only where nothing validated. The maintainer
 * converged the four on the spec's answer (2026-09-01): the declaration and
 * the read were RETIRED.
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 then DECLARED the key on that same section entry
 * (upstream #11289, maintainer ruling 2026-08-23), with a `describe()`
 * promising the behaviour this repo had just removed — so the retirement's
 * premise was false before the pin carrying it moved. objectui#8603 (director
 * seat batch #137 item 3, maintainer 2026-09-15) ruled the protocol correct
 * and RESTORED the read: Q1-A of #7129 is superseded for this key, Q2-C is
 * not. The escape hatch is real this time — `hideEmpty: false` parses green on
 * the strict section object, which is what #7129 measured it could not do.
 *
 * ⚠️ The unauthored all-empty default therefore moved back: an AUTHORED
 * section whose fields are ALL empty renders nothing unless the page writes
 * `false`. WHERE that default is resolved is the design, and the last describe
 * block below is what pins it: `RecordDetailsRenderer` applies `?? true` to an
 * authored section and `DetailSection` tests `=== true`, so a section nobody
 * could have written the key on — the direct-`fields` fallback body, the
 * `detail-section` node — keeps its skeleton. A hide there would be a hide
 * with no declarable spelling to ask the skeleton back, which is the defect
 * upstream declared the key to fix.
 *
 * Deliberately no i18n provider, so the row labels below are rung 2 of the
 * label ladder: the object's own DECLARED `label`. They read as field NAMES
 * until objectui#8497 — `record:details` handed `DetailSection` a bare
 * `{ name }` with no `label`, so `fieldLabel`'s fallback was the name itself.
 * The renderer now fills that `label` from the bound object definition, and
 * these are the same DOM nodes a translated app fills with translated labels.

 * objectui#7307 — this file's `/api/v1/security/explain` escape, served here.
 *
 * Nothing below asks for a security verdict, yet every run opened a REAL TCP
 * connection to `http://localhost:3000`. Traced with a stack probe on the
 * network-escape guard's attribution point (measured, not inferred):
 *
 *   RecordDetailsRenderer  packages/plugin-detail/src/renderers/record-details.tsx:302
 *     -> DetailView        packages/plugin-detail/src/DetailView.tsx:290, :296
 *       -> useRecordEditable  packages/plugin-detail/src/useRecordEditable.ts:76
 *         -> `const doFetch = apiFetch ?? fetch`      [the escape]
 *           POST /api/v1/security/explain  (twice per render: edit, then delete)
 *
 * `useRecordEditable` reads the host's AUTHENTICATED `apiFetch` off
 * `SchemaRendererContext` and, with no host supplying one, degrades to the
 * GLOBAL `fetch` by design — a standalone embed must keep rendering rather than
 * crash. Under happy-dom that global is a real HTTP client and the document URL
 * defaults to `http://localhost:3000`, so the relative path resolved to a live
 * request. The read is best-effort (a network or parse failure leaves the
 * record editable — fail open), which is why the cases below stayed green while
 * the request always failed.
 *
 * Answered from a RECORDING double — the shape objectui#5225 settled on, carried
 * by `packages/plugin-report/src/__tests__/DatasetReportRenderer.test.tsx` and by
 * this burn-down's earlier batches (see
 * `packages/plugin-gantt/src/ObjectGantt.navWidthDefault.test.tsx`).
 * Deliberately NOT a blanket network stub: it records every URL it is handed and
 * `afterEach` fails on any URL outside the set it serves, so an escape to
 * somewhere else reds here instead of vanishing into that `catch`.
 *
 * What it answers, and why that changes no assertion here: the permissive
 * verdict, in the two response shapes the two explain hooks read —
 * `{ record: { visible } }` for a single `recordId`, and
 * `{ records: [{ recordId, visible }] }` for a batched `recordIds`. Only the
 * FIRST is reached from this file (every call measured above comes from
 * `useRecordEditable`); the batched branch is kept so this router stays
 * byte-identical to its siblings rather than forking per file.
 * `useRecordEditable` initialises `allowed` to `true` and its failure path
 * leaves it there, so `true` and the absent verdict the failing request
 * produced are the same value at every read site — nothing below reads the
 * verdict at all.
