/**
 * The view description resolves the inline locale map — objectui#7199, half two.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `ListViewSchema.description` is `I18nLabel` — a plain string **OR** an inline
 * locale map (`{ en, 'zh-CN' }`), measured against the `@objectstack/spec@17.2.0`
 * dist this repo installs: `ListViewSchema.safeParse` ACCEPTS both and rejects a
 * number and a nested object at that key. The read site rendered
 *
 *     typeof schema.description === 'string' ? schema.description : ''
 *
 * which is not a resolution but a type test, and its else-arm is the empty
 * string. So a map — metadata the contract entitles an author to write —
 * rendered a BLANK strip in every locale.
 *
 * ## Why it is worth its own file rather than a case in `ListView.test.tsx`
 *
 * It is the second route to objectui#7199's reported symptom, and the reason
 * that card could not be closed by relaying the value alone: with only the
 * relay fixed (`app-shell`'s `fullSchema`), a per-view locale-map description
 * arrives correctly and still renders nothing — the identical silent blank, one
 * layer down. A card that closes while its symptom still reproduces stops being
 * findable, so both halves ship together and both are pinned.
 *
 * The blank is also invisible to the compiler: the else-arm is well-typed, so
 * no type error existed before the fix and none appears if it is reverted.
 * Nothing but an executed assertion holds this site.
 *
 * ## The guard moved from the RAW value to the RESOLVED one
 *
 * `{schema.description && …}` admitted `{}` — a truthy object — and rendered an
 * empty strip. The guard now reads the resolved string, so a map with no usable
 * entry drops the element entirely. That is asserted below, not just described:
 * it is the one behaviour change beyond the map arm.
 *
 * ## Which resolver, and why
 *
 * `pickLocalized` (`@object-ui/i18n`) — the spelling a TEXT NODE wants, `''` on
 * a miss. It is the same helper `TabBar.tsx` resolves the sibling `label` with
 * (`ListViewSchema.label` is the same `I18nLabel` type), one component tree
 * away. The nested `aria.ariaLabel` read site next door deliberately uses the
 * spec's `resolveI18nLabel` instead, for its `undefined`, because an ATTRIBUTE
 * wants omission rather than an empty name. The split is by DESTINATION, and
 * the two agree limb for limb — pinned by `i18nLabel-resolver-parity.test.ts`
 * in this package. ⛔ Neither is hand-rolled here.
 *
 * ## Direction and counts, written before the run (reverse verification)
 *
 * Restoring the `typeof` test at the read site was PREDICTED to turn the four
 * map cases RED (the resolved text absent; for the empty map, the strip present
 * rather than dropped) and to leave the five string-arm / suppression cases
 * GREEN — the string arm never touched the union's second limb, so it is the
 * negative control and cannot tell the two worlds apart. Predicted 4 red / 5
 * passing. Measured outcome is recorded on the PR.
 *
 * ## Locale channel
 *
 * `useDisplayLocale()` composes tenant locale → active UI language → `'en'`.
 * `LocalizationProvider` drives its first limb, pinning the locale
 * deterministically without registering a react-i18next global instance —
 * the same channel `ListView.ariaLabelInlineLocale.test.tsx` uses.
