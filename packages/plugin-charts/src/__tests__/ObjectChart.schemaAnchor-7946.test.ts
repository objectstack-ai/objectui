/**
 * objectui#7946 — `ObjectChartProps.schema` is anchored to the exported
 * `ObjectChartSchema` (`extends BaseSchema`), not `any`.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling 2026-09-09, option A (director seat, summon #20, decision
 * batch #108 item 3): as objectui#6576 did for the gallery, `ObjectChart`'s
 * props are typed by `ObjectChartSchema`, the four keys its producers write and
 * its renderer reads are declared on both published copies, and the `colors`
 * drift between them converges. B (keep `any`) and C (declare without
 * anchoring) were refused.
 *
 * ## Why this pin is compile-time
 *
 * The change is a TYPE declaration; the widget renders identically before and
 * after it, so a rendering test is blind to the whole change. What moves is the
 * ACCEPT SET of a published prop type, and `tsconfig.test.json` compiles this
 * file, so each statement below is real enforcement. Every `@ts-expect-error`
 * fails the build (TS2578) the moment the refusal it names stops happening.
 *
 * ## The before-state, and why "it still compiles" was never evidence
 *
 * objectui#7946 measured that removing both `as any` casts from `ObjectView`'s
 * two object-chart literals left `tsc --noEmit` GREEN over a program
 * `--listFiles` confirmed contained the file. That green said nothing: the
 * consumer was `(props: any)`, so every `schema={{ … }}` literal was checked
 * against nothing at all, cast or no cast. The probe had to MOVE, and the
 * `@ts-expect-error` blocks below are where it moves — each one was accepted
 * silently before this card.
 *
 * ## The ceiling, stated rather than assumed (objectui#5155)
 *
 * Anchoring buys DECLARED members their declared types. It does NOT buy
 * rejection of a MISSPELLING: `BaseSchema` carries `[key: string]: any`, which
 * `ObjectChartSchema` inherits, so `xAxisKy` compiles. objectui#6576 accepted
 * that cost knowingly for the gallery; the counter-probe at the bottom keeps it
 * visible so nobody reads this anchor as more than it is. Closing it is
 * objectui#5155, not this card.
 *
 * The schema type's own members, the read census and the source-level pins are
 * in `packages/types/src/__tests__/widget-schema-anchors-7946.test.ts`.
