 * chart-series — shape a semantic-layer `queryDataset` result into the
 * `{ data, xAxisKey, series }` triple a chart renderer consumes (ADR-0021, #1759).
 *
 * Shared by `ObjectChart` (plugin-charts) and `DatasetWidget` (plugin-dashboard)
 * so multi-dimension charts visualise identically across surfaces.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - **2+ dimensions, single measure** → pivot the SECOND dimension into one
 *    series per distinct value (grouped/coloured bars). `xAxisKey` = first
 *    dimension; each output row is one first-dimension bucket with a column per
 *    second-dimension value holding the measure. This makes the second dimension
 *    visible instead of just repeating the x-axis label.
 *  - **otherwise** (single dimension, or multiple measures) → first dimension is
 *    the x-axis and each measure is its own series (long format passes through).
 *
 * BOTH branches map a NULL first-dimension VALUE to an explicit bucket label
 * ({@link NULL_CATEGORY_LABEL}) so the group renders instead of vanishing —
 * objectui#4466 for the single-dimension branch, objectui#4497 for the pivot.
 * One doctrine, one predicate (`isNullCategory`), two call sites.
 *
 * The pivot's SECOND dimension gets the same answer as of objectui#4673, where
 * it needed one more thing than an axis bucket does: a series bucket's key is a
 * renderer `dataKey` AND a column in the emitted row, so it has to be
 * collision-safe as well as drawable. See {@link pivotSeriesBuckets}.
 *
 * A bucket's IDENTITY is separate from that display label (objectui#4508). The
 * label used to serve as its own key, which conflated two pairs of genuinely
 * different groups; see {@link chartBucketId} for the identity, and
 * {@link CHART_BUCKET_ID_KEY} for how it reaches a click handler.
 *
 * Key ABSENCE survives the pivot as of objectui#4507: an emitted bucket carries
 * the x-axis key exactly when some row of it did. A first dimension that was
 * grouped by but never PROJECTED therefore still reaches the renderer key-less,
 * where `hasNoCategoryKey` (framework#4033) names it instead of drawing an axis
 * with no marks. "Known to be empty" draws under the bucket label, "cannot
 * know" refuses — one doctrine, and now BOTH branches state it.

 * while the line below the gate still wrote its measure into the bucket. The
 * number was in the emitted row and bound to no mark — the chart understated
 * its own data without saying so, which is #4466's harm verbatim.
 *
 * A series bucket needs one thing an axis bucket does not, and that is the

 * a **row column and a renderer `dataKey`**, so it must be UNIQUE within the
 * emitted row, where an axis bucket's key is a private map key. Hence the
 * assignment below, which is injective by construction:
 *
 *  - a bucket keys its column by its own LABEL — so an ordinary pivot's rows
 *    and series are byte-identical to what they have always been, and the
 *    legend, the tooltip and the drill title read the group's own text;
 *  - unless that label cannot NAME it: shared with another bucket (the null
 *    bucket beside a stored value spelling its label — objectui#4508's second
 *    collision, on the series axis), reserved by the row itself (`xKey`, whose
 *    column IS the axis value, and {@link CHART_BUCKET_ID_KEY}), or equal to
 *    some bucket's identity;
 *  - in which case it keys by its own IDENTITY, which no other bucket has.
 *
 * The third exclusion is what makes the first two safe rather than merely
 * likely: identities are pairwise distinct, and no surviving label is one of
 * them, so the two key spaces cannot meet. That is the card's "collision-safe"
 * requirement discharged, not approximated — a record whose stored group value
 * literally spells `[null]` is a real value with a real bar, and it keeps it.
 *
 * The empty-string group keys by its own label, `''`, exactly as it paints a
 * blank legend entry (and a blank tick on the x-axis — objectui#4508 ruled `''`
 * and `null` two different groups, and this is that ruling on the series axis).
 * Measured, not assumed: recharts binds `dataKey=""` through the same
 * `getValueByDataKey` path as any other key and draws the bar at its true
 * height. That measurement is pinned at the DOM in plugin-charts.
 *
 * A row that does not carry `groupKey` at all gets NO bucket and contributes no
 * column — the other half of the doctrine, unchanged: "known to be empty" draws

      // first-dimension value renders under the bucket label rather than
      // reaching the renderer raw (which drew no mark — the objectui#4466
      // defect, one branch below). Key and display value are two different
      // things here, and now they are two different KINDS of thing.
      //
      // The bucket takes its label from the first row that CARRIES the key,
      // exactly as it took the CREATING row's raw value before — the same row
      // in every bucket a projected dimension produces, because a row whose
      // `xKey` is absent reads `xRaw === undefined` and therefore lands in the
      // `[null]` bucket and nowhere else.
      //
      // A bucket carries `xKey` exactly when SOME row of it did, and that is
      // objectui#4507: the write used to be unconditional, so a first dimension
      // GROUPED BY BUT NEVER PROJECTED (framework#4033 — no row carries the key
      // at all) reached the renderer as `{ [xKey]: undefined }`, `key in row`
      // answered true, and `hasNoCategoryKey` could not fire for a pivoted
      // chart. The defence was dead exactly where the defect it guards against
      // lands: every row collapsed into one bucket painting a blank tick, which
      // is the silent shape the placeholder exists to replace. The single-
      // dimension branch never had the problem — it passes rows through, so
      // key-absent rows stay key-absent — and this is that same answer here.
      //
      // MEASURED end to end before it was written (objectui#4507): the strategy
      // that maps engine rows to result rows writes a dimension key only when
      // the engine actually returned that column (`if (shortName in row)`), the
      // native-SQL strategy returns driver rows that carry only the columns the
      // statement selected, and JSON cannot transport `undefined` in the first
      // place — so an unprojected dimension arrives as an ABSENT key, while an
      // explicit `null` means the column WAS projected and its value is null.
      // Those are the two shapes, they are cleanly separated at the source, and
      // this branch now keeps them apart instead of merging them.
      //
      // Why the bug was invisible to every pin that "saw" the emitted row: both
      // `JSON.stringify` and `toEqual` DROP an undefined-valued key, so the
      // pivot's output read as key-absent everywhere except in the one test
      // that decides the placeholder — `key in row`.
      //
      // The upgrade in the second clause is not cosmetic. `chartBucketId`
      // encodes an absent value and a stored `null` identically (`[null]`, by
      // ADR-0021's normalization), so ONE bucket can collect both key-absent
      // rows and rows whose category is genuinely null. If any of its rows
      // carried the key, the bucket is "known to be empty" and draws under the
      // label; refusing there would tell the author their query never projected
      // a dimension that it did project — a false sentence, and the mirror of
      // the false sentence objectui#4497 refused to print by NOT relabelling a
      // key-absent row `(None)`. Both halves of that doctrine are now live in

 * Inverse of {@link buildChartSeries}: map a clicked chart segment back to the

 * same records a table/pivot row would.
 *
 * Mirrors `buildChartSeries`' pivot rule:
 *  - **2+ dimensions, single measure** (second dim pivoted into series) → match
 *    BOTH the x-axis dimension (`category`) and the series dimension (`seriesKey`).
 *  - **otherwise** → match the x-axis (first) dimension only.
 *
 * The x-axis comparison is string-wise on the rows' display values (which is
 * what the chart surfaces as `category`), unless the click carried a bucket
 * IDENTITY — {@link ChartDrillLookupOptions.bucketId} — in which case that is
 * authoritative and the display string is not consulted at all. Returns `-1`
 * when nothing matches.
 *
 * The SERIES comparison is not string-wise at all as of objectui#4673: a series
 * key is a `dataKey` {@link buildChartSeries} assigned, so it is resolved back
 * through the same {@link pivotSeriesBuckets} assignment (same rows, same
 * `nullCategoryLabel`) to the group IDENTITY it names, and rows are matched on
 * that. A null-valued second dimension had no series at all before, so its
 * segment could not be clicked; now it can, and `String(r[gDim] ?? '')` would
 * have answered that click with an empty-string group's rows — the same
 * conflation objectui#4508 removed on the x-axis.
 *
 * The NULL-category bucket {@link buildChartSeries} renders (objectui#4466) is
 * matched back to its row here, and it has to be: the caller passes the rows it
 * charted FROM (still carrying the raw null) while the click event carries the
 * bucket LABEL, so without this the one bar the fix made visible would resolve
 * to `-1` and its drill-through would silently no-op. Pass the same
 * `nullCategoryLabel` both helpers were given.
 *
 * **A null category reads as its bucket LABEL and nothing else** (objectui#4508).
 * It used to read as the label OR the empty string, on the stated grounds that
 * `''` is the drill layer's own spelling of "no group value" — but no producer
 * of this function's `category` argument writes that spelling (the one
 * production caller feeds it a chart click's category, and `computeDrillFilter`
 * is downstream of the drill, not upstream of this lookup), while `''` IS what
 * a genuine empty-string group paints. So the tolerance cost that group its own
 * drill and gave it a null group's records instead — a WRONG click, not a dead
 * one. `''` now means the empty-string group, which is what it says.
 *
 * **`xOf` covers BOTH arms, which is what let objectui#4497 bucket the pivot
 * branch without touching this function.** Worth stating because the reverse
 * would be silent: the pivot's emitted rows are AGGREGATED (`byX` collapses N
 * raw rows into one bucket per first-dimension value), so they are NOT
 * index-aligned with anything, and a caller cannot drill by the emitted row's
 * position. It drills by SEARCHING the raw rows here and indexing
 * `drillRawRows` with what this returns — see `DatasetWidget.handleChartDrill`,
 * the one production caller. So the pivot's map key and its emitted display
 * value being two different things never reached the drill: the raw rows this
 * searches still carry their null either way, and `xOf` reads the label back to
 * them in the multi-dimension arm exactly as in the single-dimension one.

 *
 * The three legacy spellings this dropped (`reference_to` / `referenceTo` /

 * `referenceTo`'s two producers were retired by objectui#6041, and

 *
 * ⚠ Unlike `resolveReferenceTo`, this helper reads the `GET /meta/object/:name`
 * document DIRECTLY — no `readFields` door strips retired keys on this path. So
 * the narrowing is load-bearing rather than cosmetic: a stored pre-objectui#6041
 * row spelling the target `referenceTo` now resolves to `undefined` here, the
 * walk yields no entry, and the caller keeps the raw value (best-effort by
 * construction — see {@link resolveDimensionFieldMeta}). That is the intended

 * unaffected.

 * same standard and removed with the same reasoning (objectui#6648).
 * `FieldSchema.reference` is a plain `z.string()`; `ObjectSchema.safeParse`
 * (spec 17.2.0) ACCEPTS `reference: 'crm_account'` and REFUSES both
 * `['crm_account']` and `{ object: 'crm_account' }` as `invalid_type`. A
 * structure-walking, key-position-aware census of both trees found 587
 * bare-string carriers at the field-def key position and ZERO array or
 * `{ object }` carriers from any producer — the only ones in either tree were
 * the green pins asserting this very tolerance. See `resolveReferenceTo` for
 * the full census, including why a multi-target lookup is NOT what the array
 * branch was serving: it returned `raw[0]` and discarded the rest, and
 * polymorphic lookup remains an undeclared, open spec gap.
 *
 * This path matters MORE than the designer's for the same reason the spelling
 * narrowing did: it reads the metadata document directly, with no `readFields`
 * door in between, so a non-string carrier now degrades visibly (the walk
 * yields no entry and the caller keeps the raw value) instead of being absorbed
 * here.
 *
 * The **type gate is deliberate**: only a declared relationship is walked, so a
 * path segment naming a plain field can never be turned into an object name and
 * fetched speculatively.

 * Resolve each dataset dimension's underlying `field` to that field's select

 * owns the terminal field (objectui#4053).
 *
 * A dimension's `field` is either a local field name (`industry`) or a
 * relationship path (`crm_account.industry`, and — per ADR-0071, which the
 * dataset designer emits — `crm_account.owner.department`). Reading the options
 * as `baseSchema.fields[path]` only ever works for the local spelling: for a
 * dotted path the options live on the RELATED object, the lookup missed
 * silently, and the chart fell through to the raw stored enum while the same
 * field as a local dimension rendered its labels beside it.
 *
 * This is the object-resolution step of that ONE lookup, not a dotted-path
 * variant beside it: a single-segment path never enters the walk and resolves
 * exactly as before, so the local path cannot drift away from the joined one.
 *
 * `loadObjectSchema` supplies each hop's object metadata doc — the caller's
 * existing channel (the same `GET /meta/object/:name` read that produced
 * `baseSchema`), so no new fetch layer is introduced. It is memoized per call,
 * because sibling dimensions routinely share a prefix (`crm_account.industry`
 * alongside `crm_account.type` fetches `crm_account` once), and seeded with
 * `baseSchema` under its own `name` so the base is never re-fetched.
 *
 * Best-effort by construction: a hop that is not a relationship, a target that
 * cannot be loaded, or a terminal field that carries no `options` simply yields
 * no entry, and the caller keeps the raw value. Returns `{ fieldPath → options }`
 * for the paths that did resolve.
 *
 * Thin wrapper over {@link resolveDimensionFieldMeta}, which is the same ONE
 * walk keeping the identity of what it found. Callers that translate option
 * labels need that identity (the i18n key is
 * `fieldOptions.<owningObject>.<terminalField>.<value>`, and for a dotted path
 * the owner is the RELATIONSHIP TARGET, not the dataset's base object) — see
 * objectui#4030.
