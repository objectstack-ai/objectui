`RichtextFieldMetadata` — the third registry key of `RichTextField` becomes declarable
(objectui#7083, maintainer ruling 2026-09-07, director decision batch #71).

`markdown`, `html` and `richtext` are one widget (`4bb940b6e`). Two of the three
already had an exported metadata type; `richtext` had none, so the runtime served it by
structure while an author could not write its metadata under an annotation at all. The
only way to write one was `as unknown as MarkdownFieldMetadata`, and that deliberate
cast — in this repo's own pin test — was the gap's sole evidence. The state was neither
a union member nor a recorded alias, which is why it had to be rediscovered to be seen.

**New.** `RichtextFieldMetadata` is exported from `@object-ui/types` and joins the
`FieldMetadata` union, so a richtext field's metadata can be written as a typed literal
and narrowed out of the union on `type`:

```ts
import type { RichtextFieldMetadata } from '@object-ui/types';

const doc: RichtextFieldMetadata = {
  type: 'richtext',
  name: 'doc',
  label: 'Release notes',
  rows: 10,
  placeholder: 'Write the release notes…',
};
```

**Additive only.** Nothing is removed or narrowed: `richtext` field metadata that was
previously written through a cast keeps compiling, and every other member of the union
is untouched. The one behavioural surface — `RichTextField` — is unchanged; it already
served all three keys and this release only gives the third one a face.

**The member's shape was derived, not copied from its two siblings.** `type`, `rows`,
`placeholder`, `mobile_fullscreen` and `label` are the keys `RichTextField` actually
reads on the `richtext` path (the last three already sit on `BaseFieldMetadata`, so the
member declares `type` and `rows`); the readonly branch hands the metadata to a cell
renderer that reads `value` only and contributes no key.

`max_length` is the one declared key the widget itself does not read, and it is declared
because a live reader outside the widget does: `buildValidationRules` compiles
`maxLength ?? max_length` into a react-hook-form rule for **every** field it is handed —
it is generic, with no field-type gate — and both form producers call it on every field
they build. So `max_length` on a `richtext` field is enforced when the form is
submitted. (It is not, however, forwarded to the editor's HTML `maxlength` attribute,
and it gets no default cap in `EmbeddableForm`: both of those enumerate field types and
omit `richtext`. That predates this release and is unchanged by it.) Omitting the key
would have left `richtext` the one type of the three whose ceiling cannot be authored
under an annotation while the submit-time rule enforcing it stayed live — a fresh
instance of the asymmetry this member exists to end.

Docs: `content/docs/fields/rich-text.mdx` teaches all three metadata types and carries a
`RichtextFieldMetadata` snippet; before this release the page stated there was no third
type.

⚠️ **Dated note, 2026-09-30 — the ceiling key is now the spec's `maxLength` — objectui#11070.** Later in this same release objectui#11070 (its text-family round) retired `max_length` from `RichtextFieldMetadata` and its two siblings in favour of `@objectstack/spec`'s `FieldSchema.maxLength`, typed by reference, and `buildValidationRules` now reads `maxLength` alone. So the paragraph above that declares `max_length`, and says a `max_length` on a `richtext` field is enforced at submit, no longer describes what ships: the ceiling is written `maxLength`, and `RichTextField` reads it as well (objectui#8438). `.changeset/11070-text-family-round5.md` states what ships; the text above is kept as the reading of this change.
