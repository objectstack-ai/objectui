/**
 * Every chart key this app registers as a lazy stub is FULFILLED by the module
 * the stub points at (objectui#8760).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `register-plugins.ts` registered ten chart variants as `registerLazy` stubs
 * pointing at `@object-ui/plugin-charts`. That package registers eight keys,
 * and three of the ten — `line-chart`, `area-chart`, `advanced-chart` — were
 * not among them.
 *
 * An unfulfilled stub does not fail; it succeeds at being useless, and it does
 * so in the two places that decide whether a defect is ever seen:
 *
 *   - AT RENDER. `SchemaRenderer`'s lazy branch is re-entered on every pass:
 *     it checks `hasLazy(type)` and returns the `Loading <type>…` placeholder.
 *     `Registry.register()` deletes a lazy entry only for the keys the loaded
 *     module actually registers, so for an unfulfilled key the entry SURVIVES
 *     the load and every subsequent pass takes the same branch. MEASURED on
 *     `b775500af`, through this file's own chain: `{ "type": "line-chart" }`
 *     painted `role="status"` / `data-lazy-loading="line-chart"` /
 *     `Loading line-chart…`, permanently. Not OBJUI-001 — no alert, no error,
 *     no console warning. A skeleton that never resolves reads to a user as a
 *     slow network, which is why this outlived the card that first noticed it.
 *   - AT AUTHORING. The stub puts the key in `getKnownTypes()`, so
 *     `check:doc-types` and the CLI's generated `KNOWN_SCHEMA_TYPES` snapshot
 *     both bless it. `content/docs/plugins/plugin-dashboard.mdx` taught
 *     `"type": "line-chart"` inside a `card` body and every gate was green on
 *     it.
 *
 * So the failure was strictly worse than an unknown key: an unknown key is
 * refused loudly at authoring time, while this one passed every check, was
 * taught by the documentation, and failed only at render in front of a user.
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * The claim under test is the OUTCOME an author observes, never "the registry
 * has N entries" or "the stub was registered" — those are the readings that let
 * the defect exist for as long as it did.
 *
 *   1. THE INVARIANT. The stub list is read from this app's own SOURCE and each
 *      key is driven through the REAL loader (`ComponentRegistry.loadLazy`),
 *      then re-checked in the registry — which is exactly what `loadLazy`'s
 *      docblock tells callers to do, because it resolves "whether or not the
 *      loaded module actually registered the expected type". A key added to
 *      that list without a matching `register()` in `packages/plugin-charts`
 *      fails HERE, on the first render nobody has done yet.
 *   2. THE RETIREMENT, as a render outcome. An authored node of a retired type
 *      now paints the loud OBJUI-001 refusal instead of the eternal skeleton.
 *   3. THE CONTROL. `pie-chart` and `bar-chart` — fulfilled variants in the
 *      same sweep — are unchanged end to end: same registry identity, same
 *      drawn output, no alert and no placeholder. Each is asserted
 *      individually; neither reads zero on both sides of the change.
 *
 * The CLI half of (2) — `objectui check` refusing a document that authors a
 * retired key, which is the "refused at authoring time" outcome on the
 * PUBLISHED surface — is pinned in
 * `packages/cli/src/__tests__/unfulfilled-chart-stubs-retired-8760.test.ts`.
 *
 * `AnyComponentSchema` is NOT part of this file's claim: it refused all three
 * spellings before this change and refuses them after
 * (`packages/types/src/__tests__/node-slot-registered-arms-8499.test.ts` holds
 * that, and already carried `area-chart` as a firing control). Claiming it here
 * would be claiming a reading this card did not move.
