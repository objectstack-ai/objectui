   *
   * ## Why this declaration exists (objectui#7105)
   *
   * The capability shipped, was documented and was demoed for a long time
   * while FOUR surfaces disagreed about it: the renderer read it, the docs row
   * described it, and neither this interface nor the zod mirror nor the
   * designer's `registrationMeta.inputs` mentioned it. The read compiled only
   * because `BaseSchema` ends in `[key: string]: any`, so
   * `(schema as any).action` resolved to `any` instead of erroring — which is
   * also why objectui#6150's census missed it. That census scanned for
   * `schema.KEY`, and this renderer spelled the read with a cast.
   *
   * The consequence was not cosmetic: an author writing against the published
   * type could not author the action at all. The key was accepted only
   * vacuously, through the index signature, and no editor completed it.
   *
   * ## Why `SchemaNode` and not the object-only shape the renderer used to want
   *
   * `SchemaNode` is the spelling every sibling node slot uses — `body`,
   * `children`, `DataTableSchema.emptyAction`, the overlay `trigger` /
   * `content` slots. The renderer previously annotated its cast
   * `BaseSchema | undefined` and guarded `typeof actionSchema === 'object'`,
   * which made this slot NARROWER than a node slot: a bare string was silently
   * dropped rather than rendered.
   *
   * Ruled (maintainer, decision batch #69, 2026-09-07) in favour of aligning
   * with the siblings — the declaration says `SchemaNode` and the RENDERER
   * moved to match it, so declared equals enforced. `SchemaRenderer` renders a
   * bare string as its own text (pinned in
   * `packages/react/src/__tests__/SchemaRenderer.primitiveSchema.test.tsx`),
   * so nothing had to be invented to make the wider arm real.
   *
   * @example { "type": "button", "label": "Create Project", "variant": "default" }
   * @example "Nothing here yet"
