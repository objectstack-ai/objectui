 * objectui#6503 — the fault diagnostic says something TRUE to an author whose
 * node VANISHED.
 *
 * ## The defect this closes
 *
 * `evaluateCondition` answers an unevaluable predicate with `true` on every one
 * of its paths. `SchemaRenderer`'s visibility chain NEGATES that answer on four
 * of its six legs (`visibleWhen` / `visible` / `visibleOn` / `visibility`), so
 * there the fail-soft default SHOWS the node and the reporter's sentence — "the
 * gate did NOT bite" — is exactly right. The chain returns it UN-negated on the
 * other two (`hidden` / `hiddenOn`): the same `true` sets `_hidden` and
 * `SchemaRenderer` returns `null`. The gate bit, and bit harder than on either
 * sibling gate — the node is not on screen at all — and those two legs were
 * handed the sentence that says the opposite.
 *
 * Worse than a merely wrong sentence: it is wrong in the direction that costs
 * the most. `SchemaRenderer`'s own #3862/#3955 comment names the asymmetry — "a
 * greyed-out control is still on screen, a node that never rendered is
 * indistinguishable from metadata that meant it". An author whose block
 * vanished, told the gate did not bite, is sent to hunt a rendering bug that
 * does not exist, past the one line that was supposed to name their predicate.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Why this file pins CONTENT, and why that is the whole point
 *
 * objectui#6038's suite already covers the `hidden` leg — "the `hidden` leg —
 * the NON-negated polarity — reports too, and still hides". It pins that the
 * line is EMITTED and that the line contains the KEY. It never pins what the
 * line SAYS, which is precisely why this defect shipped through it, survived
 * objectui#6487's rewrite of the same paragraph, and survived objectui#6510
 * writing the defect into the module's own docblock and printing it anyway.
 *
 * A pin that counts lines reproduces that blindness in new syntax. Every case
 * below therefore asserts the CONSEQUENCE SENTENCE, byte for byte, in both
 * directions: the sentence that must now appear, and the sentence that must no
 * longer. And the emission pin is re-asserted here rather than assumed — the
 * fix keeps `UNRESOLVABLE_VISIBILITY_PREFIX` on these legs deliberately, so
 * objectui#6038's prefix-filtered view still catches them.
 *
 * ## The control that stops the cheap fix
 *
 * A fix that "improved" the copy for all six legs by making it vaguer would be
 * green on the `hidden` cases alone. Group 2 pins the four NEGATED legs at
 * their existing bytes, individually, so the only way to pass this file is to
 * change the two legs that were wrong and leave the four that were right.
 *
 * ## Copy fix only — the verdict is NOT this card's to move
 *
 * The node still vanishes. That fail-soft is the shipped behaviour the
 * neighbouring family (#3862 / #3955 / #6443 / #6487 / #6445) preserved
 * deliberately. Every case here pins the VERDICT beside the line, so a run made
 * green by flipping the gate fails this file.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification, and where the prediction was WRONG
 *
 * Predicted before running: restoring `visibilityDiagnostic.ts` and
 * `SchemaRenderer.tsx` to the pinned base commit (`d7acad69d`, hash-verified
 * on disk, never `origin/main` — a shared pointer another agent's fetch moves)
 * turns groups 1, 3 and 5 RED and leaves 0, 2, 4 and 6 GREEN.
 *
 * MEASURED: 7 failed / 10 passed. Six of the seven are where predicted. The
 * seventh is group 4's dedupe case, which the prediction had in the GREEN set
 * and which fails on its closing `CONCEALMENT_CONSEQUENCE` assertion — the
 * deliberate refusal to let a rate-limit case pin only a COUNT. The prediction
 * was written per group; that one case spans two. The record is corrected here
 * rather than restated, because a false claim about which cases guard what is
 * the same class of defect this file exists to fix.
 *
 * Every RED is on a CONTENT assertion; not one is on a count or an emission.
 * The base tree printed, for a node that had VANISHED:
 *
 *     [ObjectUI] A visibility predicate could not be evaluated - node "…"
 *       hidden: "nosuchroot6503.locked == true"
 *       Reason: … nosuchroot6503 is not defined
 *     The node was treated as its safe default, which on this surface means the
 *     gate did NOT bite - …
 *
 * Group 2 is GREEN in BOTH states, and that is what a control for "unchanged"
 * must be: it asserts the four negated legs' bytes, which neither the base tree
 * nor the fixed one moves. It fails only against a fix that touched them.
