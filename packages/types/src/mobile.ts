/**
 * Breakpoint names — the Tailwind-style `xs`…`2xl` layout vocabulary, owned by
 * this package since objectui#7580 (maintainer ruling 2026-09-04, option A).
 *
 * ## Answering objectstack#4115 rather than deleting it
 *
 * This was bound to `@objectstack/spec/ui` instead of re-declared, under the
 * reason objectstack#4115 recorded here verbatim: "a local union under a spec
 * export's name is read by the next reader as the spec's own definition, so a
 * copy that is correct today is a planted premise tomorrow." That reason was
 * correct, and it is now SPENT — not overruled.
 *
 * objectstack#11027 retired the whole `ui/responsive` vocabulary upstream
 * (`ResponsiveConfigSchema`, `BreakpointName`, `BreakpointColumnMapSchema`,
 * `BreakpointOrderMapSchema`), leaving a tombstone and the protocol-18
 * conversion in `RETIRED_DEFS_BY_MAJOR[18]`. So there is no spec definition
 * left for a reader to mistake this one for: this is not a copy that may drift
 * from an original, it is the only declaration of the name that will exist.
 * A planted premise needs something to be wrong ABOUT.
 *
 * ## Why re-homed and not retired with the key
 *
 * The retirement's stated ground — that these types "had no other authorable
 * carrier" — is a claim about the whole surface, and it is measurably false on
 * this side. `responsive-grid` is a REGISTERED SDUI component (see
 * `@object-ui/layout`'s `index.ts`) whose authorable `columns` input is typed
 * by the sibling `BreakpointColumnMap` and applied by `resolveColumnClasses` on
 * the render path. This union types four live readers here: `breakpoints.ts`
 * (`BREAKPOINTS`, `BREAKPOINT_ORDER`, `getCurrentBreakpoint`),
 * `useBreakpoint.ts`, `ResponsiveContainer.tsx`, and {@link ResponsiveValue}
 * below. The tombstone's own return condition — the vocabulary "returns if and
 * when a renderer implements it" — is already met over here.
 *
 * ⚠️ Members are the retired enum's, verbatim, and must stay so: the six
 * `xs`…`2xl` keys that `BreakpointColumnMap` is keyed by.
 * `__tests__/spec-derived-unions.test.ts` pins the width, so narrowing this
 * union fails to compile rather than silently dropping a breakpoint.
 *
 * ⏳ Interim, and it self-expires: the pin is still `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0,
 * which PRE-dates the retirement and so still exports this name. The collision
 * is therefore real today and carries a reasoned entry in
 * `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs`. That entry cannot outlive the
 * interval — the guard's ratchet 3 fails an ALLOW entry that excuses nothing —
 * so the pin bump is forced to delete it and pin the vacancy instead, exactly
 * as objectui#5716's theme localization was on the 17.2.0 refresh.

// breakpoint, `gap`, `padding`, `stackOnMobile` / `stackBreakpoint`, `hidden` /
// `showOnly`) — is gone, not narrowed. Its only consumer was the `responsive`
// member of `MobileComponentConfig`, retired below by objectui#5942 (PR
// objectui#7526); once that container went, the type was a declaration plus
// two barrel re-exports and nothing else. Re-measured before removal: no type
// mounted it, nothing extended, annotated, cast to or imported it outside the
// two barrels, and the example apps and the `objectstack` sibling checkout had
// zero authors. A value written against it could not reach a renderer by any
// path.
//
// Removed outright rather than tombstoned, measured against the two-prong
// discriminator the precedent changesets state (objectui#5941, #7526; the
// one-line form in the objectui#4919 note below is under correction as
// objectui#7678): a tombstone exists (1) to steer authors to a named live
// replacement KEY, or (2) to keep loud a key the docs taught as working.
// Prong 1: none — its distinctive keys (`stackOnMobile`, `showOnly`,
// `stackBreakpoint`) have zero readers outside this declaration, and no
// mounted type has carried a `responsive` member since objectui#5942.
// Prong 2: the only CHANGELOG lines naming it are the objectstack#4115
// rename-ledger row (`ResponsiveConfig` -> `MobileResponsiveConfig`, "mobile
// box config"), replicated per package; no line taught a renderer reading it
// and no member carried a published `@default`. Whether a rename-ledger row
// counts as "taught as working" is recorded on objectui#7519 rather than
// decided here. Structurally there is no silent-strip hazard for prong 2 to
// guard: the whole interface goes, nothing ever parsed it, and there is no Zod
// mirror to host a `retirementTombstone()` — this module has never had a
// `zod/` twin — so the refusal is the compiler's own (TS2305 at the import),
// already loud.
//
// History kept because it explains the name: this was renamed off the spec's
// `ResponsiveConfig` in objectstack#4115 — the spec's is the SDUI grid contract
// (`{ breakpoint, hiddenOn, columns, order }`), a different vocabulary. The
// `__tests__/page-nav-misc-spec-parity.test.ts` rows that pinned the rename
// retired with the type: a name this package no longer exports cannot collide
// with anything, so a pin on it would guard nothing. The absence itself is
// pinned in `__tests__/mobile-residue-retired-7519.test.ts`.
//
// No BEHAVIOUR is retired here. Per-breakpoint layout lives in
// `@object-ui/mobile` as `useResponsive` / `ResponsiveContainer` /
// `useBreakpoint`, and `ResponsiveValue` above stays — `breakpoints.ts` and
// `useResponsive.ts` read it.
//
// Reopen condition: a declarative mobile box-layout surface re-enters as
// designed product surface on its own card, with the renderer that READS it
// landing in the same change as the declaration.

// RETIRED (objectui#4919, maintainer ruling 2026-08-19, ADR-0049
// enforce-or-remove): the mobile component-override surface and its mount
// point on `MobileComponentConfig` are gone, not narrowed. Every member was
// declaration-only — nothing in this repo, the example apps, or the
// `objectstack` sibling checkout ever read the property, so all six keys
// behaved identically (they did nothing), and the navigation vocabulary's
// three values were three spellings of the same no-op. Removal rather than a
// `?: never` tombstone follows this package's own discriminator: a tombstone
// exists to steer authors to a named live replacement (`crud.ts` `confirm` →
// `confirmText`; `data-display.ts` `hoverable`/`striped` → `data-table`),
// and there is no replacement here — the same zero-pull/no-successor shape as
// the retired `AccordionItem.icon` / `ToggleGroupItem.icon`, which were
// likewise removed outright rather than tombstoned.
//
// That one line states prong 1 alone. The discriminator's full, amended form
// (objectui#7678) is stated in `complex.ts` beside the `chatbot` tombstones: a
// `?: never` tombstone is available only on a SURVIVING CARRIER, and on one it
// is used when EITHER prong holds — a named live replacement KEY, or keeping
// loud a key the docs taught as working. Neither branch reaches this
// retirement: an exported type name that goes whole has no carrier to host a
// `?: never` member at all, and where a member did have one, prong 1 fails
// (above) and prong 2 has nothing to guard — this module has never had a
// `zod/` twin, so there is no mirror that could accept an undeclared key and
// strip it silently, which is the hazard prong 2 guards where a mirror does
// exist. ⛔ The route itself is settled (objectui#4919); this note states the
// rule it followed and does not reopen it.
//
// Reopen condition, recorded on objectui#4919: real mobile-override renderer
// work re-enters as designed product surface on its own card, with the
// renderer landing in the same change as the declaration. Re-adding the
// declaration alone is the declare-without-enforce shape this removal exists

 *
 * Renamed off the spec's `OfflineConfig` name (objectstack#4115): the spec's is

 * persistStorage, evictionPolicy, ttl }, sync: { conflictResolution,
 * retryInterval, batchSize }, offlineIndicator, queueMaxSize }` — i.e. the
 * mutation queue and its storage backend. This one sits a layer below, next to
 * {@link PWAConfig} and {@link PWAIcon}: a list of URL patterns
 * ({@link OfflineRoute}) paired with {@link FetchCacheStrategy}, the
 * service-worker fetch ordering. Its `defaultStrategy`/`syncStrategy` are
 * kebab-case; the spec's are snake_case — two vocabularies, one name.
 *
 * The spec's shape is modelled in objectui by `@object-ui/react`'s
 * `useOffline` config, which keeps the spec's name (and its ledger entry,
 * objectui#3159) precisely because it IS that concept.
 *
 * **The prefix is NOT reclaimable, unlike its two gesture siblings**
 * (objectui#3363). `@objectstack/spec` did vacate `OfflineConfig` when
 * `ui/offline` was deleted (objectstack#4988, PR objectstack#5321) — but the
 * spec was never the only claimant. This rename was a CROSS-PACKAGE
 * arbitration between two objectui packages, and `@object-ui/react` won it:
 * `useOffline`'s config is the offline DATA model key for key, so it holds
 * `OfflineConfig`. Since objectui#3560 that name is declared locally in
 * `packages/react/src/hooks/useOffline.ts` rather than re-exported from the
 * spec, so the retirement did not free it — it only changed who owns it.
 * Taking it back here would put two different `OfflineConfig` shapes on the
 * public surface of two packages that are routinely imported together, which
 * is the exact ambiguity objectstack#4115 renamed this away from.
 *
 * Tripwire: `__tests__/page-nav-misc-spec-parity.test.ts` (both the spec side
 * and the `@object-ui/react` owner, so neither reason can expire unnoticed).

// `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0-rc.3 deleted the whole `ui/touch` module along
// with the four other interaction-config modules (objectstack#4988, PR
// objectstack#5321). None of them had an authoring door — no metadata document
// could ever carry a touch block — so the platform stopped publishing
// vocabulary nothing could author, and a stack that parsed before the
// retirement parses byte-for-byte the same after it.
//
// The declarations below are that vocabulary moved here verbatim: same keys,
// same members, same optionality as the retired `z.infer` types this file's
// consumers used to reach through the `@objectstack/spec/ui` re-export block in
// `index.ts`. `@object-ui/mobile`'s `useSpecGesture` / `useTouchTarget` are the
// only implementations of these semantics in the repo, so this package is now
// their owner. Nothing about either hook's behaviour changes.
//
// The `Spec…` prefix on {@link SpecGestureConfig} is kept deliberately, and
// objectui#3363 has now made it the ONLY thing carrying the distinction: the
// sibling dialect above shed its own `Touch` prefix and is plain
// {@link GestureType}. (Its record half, `GestureConfig`, was retired outright
// by objectui#7519 — see the RETIRED note above. That does not free the
// prefix: `SpecGestureConfig` is still a DIFFERENT contract from the dialect's
// vocabulary — `swipe` + a direction array vs `swipe-left` — and dropping
// `Spec…` now would read as the retired name coming back under the spec's
// members.) Both prefixed names below stay exactly as they are.
