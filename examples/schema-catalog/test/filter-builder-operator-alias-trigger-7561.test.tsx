 *
 * objectui#7561's acceptance criterion, mechanised: **same tree, swap only the
 * operator spelling, the label must appear.**
 *
 * The card measured it through the real `SchemaRenderer` and reported the two
 * columns this file re-measures rather than quotes:
 *
 *   as authored          `… Category Remove condition Price Remove condition …`
 *   operators corrected  `… Category Equals Remove condition Price Less than …`
 *
 * Three catalog entries carry the rows this measures — `product-search`,
 * `with-conditions`, and the `filter-builder` nested inside `search-interface`.
 * No `SelectItem` in the operator dropdown carries a spelling from outside its
 * own camelCase vocabulary, and the trigger used to match its value LITERALLY
 * against the mounted items, so any other spelling of the same operator drew a
 * blank operator cell over a row that filtered correctly.
 *
 * ⚠️ **What these entries author has since changed, and the pin was re-aimed
 * rather than deleted.** When objectui#7561 landed they authored the spec's
 * ALIAS table (`eq` / `lt` / `gt`), and this file's last assertion was a fence
 * saying so — objectui#7561's own scope forbade touching catalog data, and the
 * fence existed to stop a lenient "repair" being smuggled in as one. That fence
 * was lifted by objectui#6939's remainder, which rewrote those seven spellings
 * to the DECLARED vocabulary so the entries validate. ⇒ the assertion is
 * INVERTED below, not dropped: it still names the key that moved, and it still
 * refuses a migration back to a dialect the mirror does not accept.
 *
 * ## Why the swap is the control and not a repair
 *
 * ⛔ No catalog data is changed BY THIS FILE. The swap happens in memory, as a
 * CONTROL: after objectui#7561's repair the two columns must be the SAME text,
 * because `normalizeFilterOperator` folds every spelling of one operator onto
 * one canonical member and the trigger now resolves through it. Before that
 * repair they differ — which is what makes this measurement able to fail.
 *
 * ⭐ The corrected column deliberately uses the dropdown's OWN camelCase ids
 * (`lessThan`), not the spec's canonical `less_than`: those ids are the ones
 * mounted, so the corrected column is the "what it would have looked like if
 * authored in the renderer's dialect" arm the card described. Both arms
 * rendering the same text is the claim; neither arm is a recommendation about
 * which vocabulary an author SHOULD use — that is objectui#7561's separate
 * ruling and is not decided here.
 *
 * ⚠️ The two vocabularies OVERLAP on three members (`equals`, `contains`,
 * `in` are spelled identically in both), so "the arms are two dialects" cannot
 * be stated as "no member of one appears in the other". The anti-vacuity leg
 * below therefore asserts that at least one row's spelling really moved, and
 * names the overlap instead of pretending it away.
