 * objectui#4795 Direction 1 — the same contract as
 * `packages/react/src/__tests__/SchemaRenderer.bindableTextKeys.test.tsx`, but
 * driven through the REAL production renderers with no stand-in for the
 * read-back half.
 *
 * That companion file pins the memo against probes, because `@object-ui/react`
 * by design does not depend on `@object-ui/components`. It can therefore prove
 * the value was EVALUATED, and only assert the read-back against a mirror of
 * the real read points. This file closes that gap: `statistic`, `card` and
 * `button` here are the shipped renderers, so a passing assertion below means
 * the evaluated value actually reached the DOM — which is the whole of what
 * objectui#4795 measured as missing ("evaluated AND read back").
 *
 * ## Why this file contains no renderer-specific fix to guard
 *
 * It guards the OPPOSITE. The ruling's implementation caution was that these
 * read-back sites must be "converged on evaluated values, not patched per
 * component" — and none of `data-display/statistic.tsx`, `layout/card.tsx` or
 * `form/button.tsx` is touched by this card. They already read the right place;
 * the single memo leg upstream now writes an evaluated value there. So these
 * assertions passing while those three files are untouched IS the convergence
 * claim, stated as a measurement rather than as a promise.
