 * objectui#8365 — `kanban.groupBy` is a DECLARED REFUSAL on this mirror, on both
 * faces.
 *
 * The runtime half and the whole reading live in `plugin-list`'s
 * `ListView.strayGroupByRefused-8365.test.tsx`, beside the render branch the
 * refusal protects. THIS file exists for the half that file cannot carry: the
 * TYPE face.
 *
 * ⭐ WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FILE, and why that is not duplication. `z.never()` at a
 * member position makes `z.input` of that member `undefined`, so the inferred
 * authoring face carries `groupBy?: never` and `tsc` refuses the key at the
 * AUTHORING SITE — before anything runs. A pin on that face is a compile-time
 * assertion: vitest erases it, and a green vitest run says nothing whatsoever
 * about it. The gate that enforces it is `tsc`, and in this package that is
 * `pnpm --filter @object-ui/types type-check`, whose `tsconfig.test.json`
 * compiles exactly this directory. ⛔ Do not "verify" the arms below by running
 * vitest over them.
 *
 * ⚠️ `@ts-expect-error` is the assertion, not a suppression: if a later edit
 * makes `kanban: { groupBy }` compile again, tsc reports the directive itself as
 * unused and this file goes RED. That is the failure mode the pin is for.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted before running, then observed:
 * remove the `groupBy` arm from `KanbanConfig` and `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`
 * goes RED here with TS2578 ("Unused '@ts-expect-error' directive"), while the
 * two positive controls below stay silent in both worlds.
