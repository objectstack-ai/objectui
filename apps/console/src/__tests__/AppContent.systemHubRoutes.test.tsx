/**
 * The system-navigation entries under `/apps/:app/system/…` reach the
 * framework-owned system objects instead of failing (objectui#3655), and the
 * bare `/apps/:app/system` lands on the navigation-declared settings hub
 * (objectui#3743).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * Both sidebars' `sys-*` cluster and the system hub's card wall (retired since,
 * by objectui#3743) emitted five
 * `/apps/setup/system/{users,organizations,roles,positions,permissions}` URLs.
 * They were real routes until `apps/console` was slimmed for third-party
 * customisation (cccdf84d7), which deleted the bespoke wrapper pages on the
 * grounds that "these objects are now contributed by framework plugins … and
 * resolved via the generic /apps/setup/<object_name> route". The producers were
 * never retargeted and nothing redeclared the URLs, so all five fell through to
 * app-shell's tail — where the failure they got depended on how long the word
 * was, because `ShorthandRecordRedirect`'s `looksLikeRecordId` treats any
 * URL-safe segment of 6+ chars as a record id:
 *
 *   users (5), roles (5)                       -> RouteNotFound, "Page not found"
 *   organizations (13), positions (9),         -> rewritten to
 *   permissions (11)                              `…/system/record/<word>` and
 *                                                 rendered as a record of an
 *                                                 object literally named `system`
 *
 * Same cluster, same click, two unrelated failure screens — and the second is
 * the worse one, because a record page for a nonexistent object reads as a
 * backend/data problem rather than a dead link.
 *
 * ## What this file measures
 *
 * It renders app-shell's REAL `AppContent` (`DefaultAppContent`) with this
 * host's REAL `systemRoutes` fragment, so the tail routes under test —
 * `:objectName`, `:objectName/record/:recordId`, `ShorthandRecordRedirect`,
 * `RouteNotFound` — are the shipped ones, not a transcription. That matters
 * here more than usual: the defect IS the interaction between this fragment and
 * that tail, and a hand-copied tail would be free to agree with whatever the
 * fragment does.
 *
 * `ChainRecorder` records every location the router settles on, so "one hop" is
 * an assertion rather than an inference; the pre-fix landings above are
 * reachable by deleting the five `system/*` routes from `systemRoutes` (the
 * `object-view` probes go red and the chain returns to `Page not found` /
 * `…/system/record/<word>`).
 *
 * ## Two branches
 *
 * `AppContent` has two route tables and this host passes the same fragment to
 * both. With an active app the redirect target resolves (`:objectName` renders
 * `ObjectView`); on a zero-app deployment there is no `:objectName` route at
 * all, so the target lands on the "No Apps Configured" empty state — measured
 * and pinned below rather than asserted away, because a deployment with no apps
 * in its metadata also has no `sys_user` to show.
 *
 * ## The `permissions` leg, closed
 *
 * Four of the five landed in PR #3673. `system/permissions` was held back and
 * its broken landing PINNED, because the framework splits this console's
 * "Permissions" into two Setup entries (`sys_capability`, ADR-0066 layer 1 —
 * the definition registry; `sys_permission_set`, layer 2 — the grant container
 * the permissions docs call "the only capability container") and guessing would
 * have bound every click and bookmark to a surface nobody chose. objectui#3655
 * decided it as `sys_permission_set`: the card that emitted this URL said
 * "Manage permission rules and assignments", which is layer 2. Those pins are therefore
 * REPLACED here, not merely kept passing — that was their stated purpose.
 *
 * What the pins measured beyond the gap itself — that an undeclared segment
 * fails in two different ways depending on its LENGTH — is still true and still
 * measured, now on a hypothetical pair that is undeclared in both branches
 * (`system/teams`, 5 chars, and `system/workgroups`, 10). Re-pointing them was
 * the alternative to letting the length asymmetry lose its only coverage the
 * moment its last real specimen got a route.
 *
 * ## The bare `system` landing (objectui#3743)
 *
 * `/apps/:app/system` used to render `SystemHubPage`, a hand-written card wall.
 * objectui#3743 retired it; the host now declares `system` as
 * `SystemLandingRedirect`, which forwards onto `system/settings`, the settings
 * hub that every system navigation declares (the reasoning is on that
 * component). The URL itself is still the target of every "System Settings"
 * sender in app-shell, so its landing is pinned here, once per branch, against
 * the REAL host fragment and the REAL `DefaultAppContent`: that is the property
 * of the URL, measured once, while each sender's href stays pinned beside the
 * sender. The zero-app empty state's button is also driven end to end here,
 * because it is the one sender whose click has to leave a dead end.
