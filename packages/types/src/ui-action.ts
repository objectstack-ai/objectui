 * THE placement rule: does `action` render at `location`?
 *
 * `locations` is an action's placement declaration, and this predicate is the
 * single owner of what it means (objectui#3142). An action renders at a
 * location only if it **declares** that location — a missing or empty
 * `locations` places the action NOWHERE, it does not place it everywhere.
 *
 * That reading is the platform's: ADR-0078 lists "an `action` with no
 * `locations`" as a verified inert shape — metadata that parses, reports
 * success and does nothing — which only holds if omitting the key means "no
 * placement". The engine (`ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation`), the record
 * header (`RecordDetailView`), related lists (`RelatedRecordActionsBridge`),
 * the environment toolbar and `DeclaredActionsBar` all already read it that
 * way. Four renderers disagreed, in three different directions — `action:bar`
 * and metadata-admin showed an undeclared action EVERYWHERE, `page:header`
 * showed it on the header, `action:group` showed it for `undefined` but hid it
 * for `[]` — so the same action appeared or vanished depending on which
 * component happened to render it. #3142 collapsed all four onto this
 * function; add a fifth caller rather than a fifth dialect.
 *
 * A locationless action is still reachable where placement comes from
 * somewhere other than `locations`: the selection bar driven by a view's
 * `bulkActions` / `bulkActionDefs` (naming it there IS the declaration), and
 * the `systemActions` chrome slot, which is placed by the host, not authored.
 *
 * `location: undefined` means the caller is not filtering by location at all
 * (e.g. an `action:bar` rendering an explicitly-supplied list) — every action
 * passes.

 * Action parameter definition (ObjectStack Spec v2.0.1)
 *
 * The AUTHORING shape of an action param: what a host app WRITES. It is not a

 * READS after `resolveActionParams()` has inlined the field reference — see the
 * "authoring ≠ resolved" note below, and objectui#3174 for what conflating them
 * cost.
 *
 * It is aligned with the spec's `ActionParamSchema` input (#4074 steps 2–3):
 * `name` / `label` / `type` are optional because the `field` reference form
 * supplies them from an existing object field. The RESOLVED shape the dialog
 * consumes — after `resolveActionParams()` in `@object-ui/app-shell` inlines
 * the field reference — is `@object-ui/core`'s
 * `ActionParamDef`, which keeps `name`/`label`/`type` required. Authoring and
 * resolved are different types on purpose; conflating them is what made a
 * spec-valid `{ field: 'status' }` param a type error here for as long as this
 * interface required all three.
 *
 * DERIVED from the spec's `ActionParamSchema` (objectstack#4115): every spec
 * key — `name`, `field`, `objectOverride`, `required`, `placeholder`,
 * `helpText`, `defaultValue`, `multiple`, `accept`, `maxSize`, `reference`,
 * `defaultFromRow`, `visible`, `requiresFeature` — flows in **by reference**
 * from `z.input<typeof ActionParamSchema>`, so a key the spec adds cannot go
 * undeclared here again.
 *
 * `z.input`, not `z.infer`: `required` carries a `.default(false)` and `visible`
 * a canonicalizing pipe, so the parsed shape makes `required` mandatory and
 * `visible` an `{ dialect, source }` envelope. This is the authoring side —
 * metadata as written, before the server parses it — which is the `z.input` rule
 * from objectui#3169.
 *
 * The hand copy this replaces omitted three spec keys the authoring surface
 * really uses: `reference` (the inline lookup target `resolveActionParams()`
 * reads), `defaultFromRow` (which the metadata designer's own inspector writes)
 * and `requiresFeature`; and it narrowed `visible` to a bare string even though
 * the resolver has always accepted the envelope form too.
 *
 * ONE key is pinned locally: `type` takes {@link ResolvableParamFieldType} —
 * the spec vocabulary plus objectui's declared legacy spellings
 * (`checkbox` / `reference` / `datetime-local`), which the dialog resolves.
 * `type` is a NARROWING of a key the spec already declares, not an addition:
 * the interface adds no key of its own (objectui#3201 retired the last one).
 *
 * **Authoring ≠ resolved — the resolved-side keys are NOT declared here**
 * (objectui#3174). This interface used to add the whole picker group on top of
 * the spec's keys — `referenceTo`, `displayField`, `idField`,
 * `descriptionField`, `titleFormat`, `lookupColumns`, `lookupFilters`,
 * `lookupPageSize`, `dependsOn` — "for parity with the resolved shape". None of
 * them is authorable:
 *
 *  - `ActionParamSchema` is `.strict()`, so every one of them is a hard PARSE
 *    REJECTION on the server; `referenceTo` is even listed by name in the
 *    schema's alias map, which answers it with "use `reference`".
 *  - `resolveActionParams()` never read any of them. It reads the spec's
 *    `reference` for an inline picker target and inherits the rest from the
 *    referenced object field.
 *
 * So `{ name: 'account_id', type: 'lookup', referenceTo: 'account' }` type-
 * checked, lost its picker target on the way through the resolver, and rendered
 * as a plain record-id text box — while the dev warning that fired told the
 * author to declare `reference`, a key this type did not have. Declaring the
 * resolved spelling here is what made that a *silent* authoring error instead
 * of a compile error, so it is gone: `reference` is the one authorable
 * spelling, and the eight remaining picker keys come from the field a
 * field-backed param names (`{ field: 'account_id' }`). An authored
 * `referenceTo` now fails `tsc` here, and — for the JS/JSON authoring paths
 * `tsc` does not gate — `resolveActionParams()` names it in a dev warning
 * rather than dropping it silently.
 *
 * The rule this leaves behind, pinned by the drift guard: **this interface
 * declares exactly the spec's authorable keys.** A capability the resolved
 * shape has and the authoring shape lacks is either a spec change or a
 * field-backed param — never a key added here.
 *
 * That rule is now literal, with no named exception. `validation?: string` was
 * carried here as the one key this interface added on top of the spec's set,
 * and objectui#3201 retired it: `ActionParamSchema` is `.strict()` and does not
 * list it, so an authored `validation` was a hard PARSE REJECTION on the server
 * (`Unrecognized key(s) on this action param`) while `tsc` accepted it happily;
 * and nothing ever read it — `resolveActionParams()` never had it on
 * `RawActionParam`, `paramToField()` never mapped it, and `buildValidationRules()`
 * in `@object-ui/fields` builds rules from `required` / `minLength` /
 * `maxLength` / `pattern` field metadata with no `validation` branch. It was
 * removed rather than implemented (ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove): giving it
 * meaning would mean first deciding what an "expression" is here (CEL? formula?
 * regex?) and adding it to `@objectstack/spec`, which is where such a capability
 * would have to start.
 *
 * `label` and `options[].label` are NOT pinned: both flow in by reference with
 * the rest of the spec's keys. The comment here used to justify a local
 * override as a widening — "labels take the spec's `I18nLabel` (a string or a
 * per-locale record)" — and then justified deleting that override with a claim
 * about the spec that was never true: "in spec 17 `I18nLabelSchema` is
 * `z.ZodString`, inline per-locale objects were dropped in favour of
 * translation files". The spec never narrowed that way (objectui#4611).
 *
 * What `I18nLabel` admits, stated in as many words by its own doc block in
 * `@objectstack/spec/ui` (objectstack#5728, maintainer ruling 2026-08-06): a
 * display label in one of TWO authorized forms — a plain default-language
 * string, whose translations live in a translation bundle addressed by
 * convention, or an inline locale map keyed by locale tag (`en`, `zh-CN`, ...)
 * picked at render time — closing with "Both are real; neither is deprecated
 * by this schema." The map form is live here, not theoretical: this repo's
 * renderers resolve it through `pickLocalized` (e.g. `schema.title` in
 * `packages/components/src/renderers/layout/containers.tsx`), and the spec
 * ships `resolveI18nLabel` as the matching resolver on its own side.
 *
 * Deleting the override was still right, for a reason that does not depend on
 * which forms the union holds: a plain string is one of the forms `I18nLabel`
 * admits, so a local `string | I18nLabel` collapses to `I18nLabel` — an exact
 * restatement of the inherited type while claiming to be wider than it.
 * Inheriting by reference is what keeps these keys correct as the spec's set of
 * authorized forms moves; an override is what cannot.
 *
 * If you need today's spelling rather than the authorized forms, measure it:
 * against `@objectstack/spec@17.0.0` it is `z.ZodUnion([z.ZodString,
 * z.ZodRecord(z.ZodString, z.ZodString)])` (`dist/ui/index.d.ts:614`). That is
 * a reading of one version, not a standing fact about the schema — which is
 * the distinction the sentence this replaces failed to make.
 *
 * Guarded since objectui#5612, and it was not before: the `it(...)` case in
 * `__tests__/page-nav-misc-spec-parity.test.ts` that calls itself an inverted
 * pin on this decision used to assert only that a plain string is assignable to
 * `I18nLabel` — which holds under either form, so the widening above went
 * through it green. It now asserts BOTH authorized forms are assignable, here
 * and on `options[].label`, and so fails when either is withdrawn.
