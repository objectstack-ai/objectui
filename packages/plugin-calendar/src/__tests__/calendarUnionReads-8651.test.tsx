 * objectui#8651 — `ObjectCalendar` is typed at the PUBLISHED schema of the
 * element it is registered as, and every key it reads off the node is declared
 * there.
 *
 * ## What was measured, and why the card's three-way split collapsed to two
 *
 * The card filed twelve keys in two classes — four undeclared on both arms of
 * `ObjectGridSchema | CalendarSchema`, eight declared on exactly ONE arm — and
 * asked, as its FIRST question, whether that union is right at all. Measured
 * with the TypeScript checker on the merge-base (`getPropertyOfType`, never a
 * grep — objectui#8410), the answer decides eleven of the twelve at once:
 *
 * ⚠️ Note what the union itself answers, because it is easy to get backwards
 * and this file's first cut did: on the UNION only SEVEN of the fifteen reads
 * were undeclared. `ObjectGridSchema` carries `BaseSchema`'s index signature,
 * so the five `CalendarSchema`-only keys resolved through it and compiled with
 * no cast — silently typed `any`, which is the defect rather than the absence
 * of one. Per-ARM is the reading the card tabled; per-UNION is the reading the
 * compiler acts on; they are different numbers and both are measured here.
 *
 *   `ObjectCalendarSchema` — this repo's published interface for the
 *   `object-calendar` element, and its zod mirror — ALREADY declares eleven of
 *   the fifteen keys this renderer reads, `allDayField`, `startDateField`,
 *   `endDateField`, `titleField`, `colorField` and `defaultView` among them
 *   (objectui#8466, #8174, #8314, #9239). Neither arm of the union it was
 *   actually annotated with is that interface.
 *
 * ⇒ the reads were never undeclared for want of a declaration; they were
 * undeclared because the props type pointed somewhere else. Both arms go:
 *
 *   - `ObjectGridSchema` is `type: 'object-grid'`. Nothing hands this component
 *     one — the single production call site is this package's own
 *     `index.tsx`, and both of its registrations (`object-calendar` and
 *     `calendar`) publish `OBJECT_CALENDAR_INPUTS`, the `object-calendar`
 *     surface.
 *   - `CalendarSchema` was declared LOCALLY in `ObjectCalendar.tsx`, absent
 *     from this package's barrel — so no importer could ever name it — and it
 *     SHADOWED `@object-ui/types`' own published `CalendarSchema`, which is the
 *     date-picker primitive (`form.ts`, reachable at `ui:calendar` only,
 *     objectui#8499). Two layers, one word.
 *
 * The shape this leaves is the one every sibling widget in the family already
 * has: `ObjectKanban` takes `ObjectKanbanSchema`, `ObjectGantt` takes
 * `ObjectGanttSchema`, `ObjectMap` takes `ObjectMapSchema` — and `plugin-map`
 * is registered under TWO tags (`object-map` and `map`) with a single published
 * props type, exactly as this package is.
 *
 * ## The two keys that do NOT come along, and their separate exits
 *
 *   - `calendar` is declared by NO face of this repo, while
 *     `@objectstack/spec`'s `ComponentPropsMap['object-calendar']` declares it
 *     as the configuration container AND this package's registration `inputs`
 *     publishes it AND `getCalendarConfig` reads it FIRST. Triage's ruling for
 *     the family (objectui#8327, comment `5619610246`) makes that exit
 *     mechanical: declared in spec ⇒ align the mirror. Declared here.
 *   - `dateField` / `endField` are ROUTED TO THE PRODUCER, the third exit.
 *     ⛔ An earlier cut of this card RETIRED them on a census that was FALSE,
 *     and the false census is recorded here because it is the transferable
 *     part. It said: zero producers write either spelling onto a calendar node.
 *     It could not see the producer because the producer does not write the key
 *     LITERALLY — `plugin-list/src/ListView.tsx`'s `case 'calendar':` SPREADS
 *     the authored block flat onto the node it emits, objectui's own published
 *     `ListViewSchema` accepts `calendar.dateField`, and
 *     `resolveTimelineDateBinding` in that file documents it as *"the pre-#2231
 *     alias for `startDateField`"* and honours it. A word-boundary text census
 *     is structurally blind to a key arriving through a spread. Measured by
 *     mounting the producer: `calendar: { dateField, titleField }` emits a node
 *     with a flat `dateField` and NO `startDateField`, which the merge-base
 *     draws and the retiring tree refused. ⇒ the remedy is at the producer,
 *     which is outside this card's file surface, so the rungs STAY and both
 *     keys are ledgered below with the producer named. The standing carrier for
 *     the alias question is objectui#8355 (open, undecided); ⛔ this card does
 *     not open a second one and does not decide it.
 *
 * ## ⛔ `navigation` is NOT ruled here, and its verdict is INVARIANT
 *
 * objectui#8652 carries the `navigation` family; the maintainer ruled B
 * (declare on the platform element schemas first, then mirror), the spec half
 * is objectstack#17987, and #8652 is `pm:blocked` on it. This card must not
 * rule, declare, retire or touch it.
 *
 * ⭐ It does not, and that is measurable rather than asserted: through the
 * UNION the key was already undeclared, and on `ObjectCalendarSchema` it is
 * undeclared too. ⚠️ The rule is NOT "declared on every arm" — the reading
 * recorded at the top of this file carries five keys on the union that only ONE
 * arm declares (`colorField` `dateField` `defaultView` `endField` `titleField`).
 * It is: a union member is available only when EVERY arm supplies it — by its
 * own declaration OR through an applicable index signature. `ObjectGridSchema`
 * declares `navigation`; `CalendarSchema` neither declares it nor has an index
 * signature to supply it; so the union does not carry it. Same
 * verdict at the read site before and after; the read itself is untouched. It
 * is ledgered BY NAME below, with an assertion that it is STILL READ — a stale
 * exception is a hole (the objectui#8885 ledger discipline).
 *
 * ## What the population assertion is, and why it is not a written-down list
 *
 * AGENTS.md #9: a claim that needs a live population is defended by an
 * instrument that re-derives it every run, never by a figure in prose. So the
 * central row below takes BOTH sides from the tree at run time — the keys read
 * come from a cast-aware census over `ObjectCalendar.tsx` (objectui#6576's
 * `schemaReads`, comment-masked so a key that appears only in prose cannot
 * move a verdict), and the keys declared come from the zod mirror's own
 * `.shape`, never from parse acceptance, which under `.passthrough()` cannot
 * tell "declared" from "admitted unexamined" (objectui#8466's instrument).
 *
 * The TS face is held to the same set by the standing `zod-mirror-parity`
 * ratchet plus the compile-time pins in this file, so one row covers both
 * published faces without this file re-implementing a second checker.
 *
 * ## The ceiling, stated rather than assumed (objectui#5155 / #7927)
 *
 * `BaseSchema` ends in `[key: string]: any` and its mirror is `.passthrough()`,
 * so declaring a key buys VALUE validation and never buys rejection of a
 * MISSPELLING. The counter-probe below pins that honestly, so nobody reads this
 * file as claiming more than it does.
