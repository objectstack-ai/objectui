 *
 * Exit: 0 = OK, 1 = an unregistered cwd-rooted read, a stale registry entry, or
 *       a collapsed population.
 *
 * ## The rule, and why a rule was not enough (objectui#8953)
 *
 * Root `AGENTS.md` teaches it:
 *
 *   ⛔ 测试在断言里读文件系统,根定在它自己的文件上,永不定在 `process.cwd()`。
 *
 * and the bullet ends by declaring that nothing enforces it. That is this gate.
 *
 * The mechanism, measured twice. A package's own `test` script is
 * `vitest run --root ../.. packages/PKG/` (objectui#3240), which is what
 * `pnpm --filter PKG test` and `turbo run test` both run. It moves VITEST's
 * root to the repo root and leaves `process.cwd()` in the package directory.
 * So a test that builds a path out of the cwd reads a DIFFERENT TREE depending
 * on which invocation started it, and the same assertion reaches two verdicts:
 *
 *   objectui#7791 (PR #7796)  one file, cwd the only variable:
 *                             repo root `7 passed`, package dir `2 failed / 5 passed`
 *   objectui#7799 (PR #7806)  a census under `packages` of every test mentioning
 *                             `cwd()`, 13 genuinely defective, repaired one at a time
 *
 * ## Why this is not a `process.cwd` grep, and what that costs
 *
 * ⛔ The spelling is not the defect. One of objectui#7799's own 13 was
 * INVISIBLE to the census regex that found the other twelve, because it spelled
 * the read
 *
 *   (globalThis as unknown as { process: { cwd(): string } }).process.cwd()
 *
 * to dodge a browser `process` shim in `packages/components/src/global.d.ts`.
 * A detector a defect can walk around by renaming the call is the failure mode
 * this card was filed under, so the shape here is deliberately not textual:
 *
 *  1. **Sinks, not spellings.** The scan starts at the FILESYSTEM CALL --
 *     `readFileSync`, `existsSync`, `readdirSync`, … (`FS_SINKS`) -- and asks
 *     what its path argument is rooted at. A read that never happens cannot
 *     reach a wrong tree, and a cwd read that feeds no filesystem call is not
 *     this defect.
 *  2. **Roots are RESOLVED, not matched.** `rootOf` walks the path expression
 *     to its leftmost term THROUGH the file's own bindings, so the defect is
 *     caught where it is committed rather than where it is spelled:
 *
 *       const siteDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'apps/site/app/components');
 *       …
 *       const read = (f) => fs.readFileSync(path.join(siteDir, f), 'utf8');   // ← flagged
 *
 *     The sink line holds no `cwd` at all. Both real instances of that shape in
 *     this tree were found this way and by nothing else.
 *  3. **Any spelling that EVALUATES to the cwd counts.** `rootOf` classifies a
 *     call whose callee is named `cwd` however it was reached -- bare
 *     `process.cwd()`, `globalThis.process.cwd()`, the `as unknown as` cast
 *     above, or an alias bound three hops earlier -- because it reads the AST's
 *     call target, not the source text. `process.env.PWD` and
 *     `process.env.INIT_CWD` are the same root under another name and are
 *     classified with it. So is a BARE RELATIVE STRING handed straight to a
 *     filesystem call: `readFileSync('e2e/live/.auth/state.json')` names no root
 *     at all, which is precisely how it gets the ambient one.
 *
 * ⚠️ What it CANNOT see, named rather than implied -- `--blind` enumerates
 * every one of them in the tree as it stands, and the census line prints the
 * count on every run so that this gate's silence can never read as a clean
 * bill of health for the whole class:
 *
 *   - a root that arrives as a FUNCTION PARAMETER, or from an IMPORT. `rootOf`
 *     resolves bindings within one file and stops at the module edge, so a
 *     helper that resolves a repository path on the test's behalf is invisible
 *     here. That is the largest blind spot and it is structural.
 *   - a root read from any environment variable other than the two named above.
 *   - a filesystem call reached dynamically (`fs[name](p)`), or one made by a
 *     helper module rather than by the test file itself.
 *   - a cwd-rooted path handed to something that is NOT a filesystem call --
 *     a `spawnSync` cwd option, a glob library, `import()`. Deliberate: those
 *     have their own contracts and this gate does not model them.
 *   - test-shaped files that do not match `TEST_FILE`, and any file git does
 *     not track.
 *
 * ## The verdict, stated exactly
 *
 * A violation is **an ambient root with at least one path segment appended to
 * it** -- that is, a test resolving a path BELOW the cwd. Appending is what
 * makes the verdict cwd-dependent; the cwd itself is not:
 *
 *   existsSync(cwd)                                   ← NOT a violation
 *   existsSync(join(cwd, 'pnpm-workspace.yaml'))      ← a violation
 *
 * The first is `packages/components/src/__tests__/browser-process-shim-scope.test.ts`,
 * which exists to compile a `process.cwd()` call and asserts only that the
 * binding names a real absolute directory. PR #7806 rewrote it into exactly
 * that shape, and it needs no entry in any list here: the rule gets it right.
 *
 * ⛔ The appended segments are NOT required to look like a repository path.
 * Requiring `packages/`-or-similar in the suffix would be the grep thinking
 * coming back in through the window -- a path assembled from variables carries
 * no such literal, and anything below a cwd that moves is cwd-dependent whether
 * or not this file recognises its name.
 *
 * ## The fix this gate points at
 *
 * The spelling PR #7796 landed and PR #7806 reused, from BARE `import.meta.url`:
 *
 *   const SELF_DEPTH_BELOW_REPO_ROOT = 5; // packages / pkg / src / __tests__ / this file
 *   const REPO_ROOT = decodeURIComponent(new URL(import.meta.url).pathname)
 *     .split('/')
 *     .slice(0, -SELF_DEPTH_BELOW_REPO_ROOT)
 *     .join('/');
 *
 * ⚠️ This gate does NOT flag the two-argument `new URL(rel, import.meta.url)`
 * form, and the reason is a measurement rather than a preference. AGENTS.md
 * warns that Vite rewrites it to an `http://localhost:3000/@fs/…` URL on which
 * `fileURLToPath` throws. Re-measured for objectui#8953 on this tree: 21 live
 * call sites use it and all of them pass, from the repo root AND from a package
 * directory (`packages/app-shell` probed both ways, 21 and 13 tests green). It
 * is self-rooted by construction, so it is not this defect in either case, and
 * a gate that reddened 21 green files over a hazard that did not reproduce
 * would be a false-positive engine. The warning is left where it is; whether it
 * still holds anywhere is a separate question from this one.
