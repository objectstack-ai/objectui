/**
 * Drift guard — every field type has an explicit inline-edit decision on the
 * DETAIL page (objectui#4220).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `InlineFieldInput` hand-rolls a type switch that ends in a raw text input,
 * and `@object-ui/fields` maintains the form's widget map. The two lists drifted
 * apart repeatedly, and every time they did, the gap was silent AND lossy: a
 * type nobody had thought about fell to the terminal input, was displayed
 * through `coerceToSafeValue` and written back as a bare string. That produced
 * six cards from ONE cause — #2942 (the grid's copy), #3355, #4216, #4219,
 * #4221/#4228 and this one — so the deliverable that outlives the fix is not
 * another routing line, it is this assertion.
 *
 * The fields package already guards ITS half (`FieldEditWidget.test.ts`: every
 * form type is a widget or a documented exclusion). This is the detail page's
 * matching pair, over the SAME universe of types plus the spec's own enum.
 *
 * ## The contract
 *
 * Every field type must fall into EXACTLY ONE of four buckets:
 *
 * | bucket | who decides | what the user gets |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | **excluded** | the hosts' gates (`isInlineExcludedDetailFieldType` / `isComputedFieldType`) | no inline editor at all — containers, credentials, computed |
 * | **routed** | `InlineFieldInput`'s own switch (`INLINE_ROUTED_FIELD_TYPES`) | the dedicated editor that type already had |
 * | **delegated** | `FieldEditWidget` | the SAME widget the form uses |
 * | **benign** | `INLINE_PLAIN_TEXT_FIELD_TYPES` | the terminal text input, losslessly (the value is already a string) |
 *
 * A type in NONE of the four is red — that is a new type nobody decided about,
 * and the default it would otherwise inherit is the value-destroying one. A
 * type in TWO is red as well: overlapping claims are how a decision gets made
 * twice and disagrees with itself.
 *
 * The two behavioural halves below are what stop this from being a tautology
 * over four hand-written sets: the declared bucket is checked against what
 * `InlineFieldInput` actually RENDERS for that type.
