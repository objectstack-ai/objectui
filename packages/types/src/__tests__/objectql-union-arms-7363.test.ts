/**
 * `object-gallery` / `object-data-table` nodes reach a validation arm
 * (objectui#7363).
 *
 * PR #7355 (objectui#6576) minted `ObjectGallerySchema` and
 * `ObjectDataTableSchema` on both faces and deliberately left
 * `ObjectQLComponentSchema` alone, so `AnyComponentSchema` — and with it
 * `validateSchema` / `safeValidateSchema` / `objectui validate` — had no arm for
 * either node type. A document carrying one was refused as matching NO arm,
 * exactly as before the schemas existed, and a wrong-typed key on such a node
 * could never be diagnosed by name.
 *
 * Two legs per node type, because a pass alone proves nothing — the shape
 * `safe-validate-corpus-6318.test.ts` uses for `code-editor` / `bar-chart`:
 *
 *  1. a minimal document validates through the published entry point;
 *  2. the arm is a real declaration: a wrong-typed DECLARED key on the node is
 *     refused, and the refusal names that key. `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`,
 *     so an UNKNOWN key would prove nothing; every probe below is a key the
 *     mirror declares. Before the arms existed the same documents were refused
 *     too — for the wrong reason, with no arm naming the key — which is why the
 *     BY-NAME half is the load-bearing one, not `.success === false`.
 *
 * The TS face is pinned beside it: `ObjectQLComponentSchema` narrows to each
 * declaration by its discriminant, instead of to `never`.
