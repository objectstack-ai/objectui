 * `record:highlights` — the published authoring surface stays in parity with
 * `@objectstack/spec` RecordHighlights* (objectui#3407, objectstack#5176).
 *
 * The registry `inputs` ARE the published contract: `gen-manifest.ts`
 * serializes them into `sdui.manifest.json` (the save-gate + parser whitelist)
 * and into `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts` (the JSX authoring type surface). Nothing in
 * the repo cross-checks them against the spec, so both drift directions are
 * silent and both are harmful:
 *
 *   - a spec ENTRY key that no input mentions is a key an AI author cannot
 *     discover (the complaint that opened #3407: `readonly` was enforced by the
 *     HeaderHighlight gate and honoured by the renderer, but the `fields`
 *     description still spelled the entry shape `{name,label?,icon?,type?}`);
 *   - a top-level input the spec does not declare is worse than undocumented,
 *     it is actively misleading: the manifest would be publishing an authoring
 *     surface the platform does not accept. That verdict holds on every pin —
 *     an UNDECLARED top-level key is not an authoring surface — while the
 *     contract states it two ways depending on the installed
 *     `@objectstack/spec`: a closed `RecordHighlightsProps` refuses the key
 *     with a named `unrecognized_keys`, where the older strip-mode `z.object`
 *     dropped it from `data` with no error at all, which is exactly why this
 *     gap could stay silent for as long as it did. Which way the installed pin
 *     states it is probed behaviourally, below, by
 *     `specRefusesUnknownTopLevelKeys` — never narrated here as a
 *     present-tense fact about a mode.
 *
 * Both assertions derive their expectation from the spec at runtime rather than
 * restating today's key list, so a spec change fails here instead of quietly
 * widening the gap.
