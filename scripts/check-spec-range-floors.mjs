/**
 * A package's declared `@objectstack/spec` FLOOR must carry every symbol that
 * package's own published artifact references.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-spec-range-floors.mjs   (also `pnpm check:spec-floors`)
 * Exit: 0 = every consumer-facing floor admits only specs that carry the symbols,
 *       1 = at least one floor admits a spec that lacks one, OR the gate could
 *           not read an artifact, a published export surface, or a floor
 *
 * ## What a GREEN run does NOT judge: key REFUSAL (objectui#9036)
 *
 * This gate judges SYMBOL PRESENCE, and only that. A floor that admits a spec
 * which DECLARES the symbol but REFUSES the keys this repository's packages
 * write into it is GREEN either way: nothing here ever parses a payload against
 * the floor's own schema. So a green run of this gate is not evidence that the
 * floors are behaviourally sound, and must not be read as such.
 *
 * That boundary is deliberate and measured, not an oversight. objectui#9036
 * priced the behavioural leg end to end — the census of closed schemas, the
 * false-positive rate of the cheap criterion, the fixture cost of the expensive
 * one — and the measurement lives there. Per commandment #9 no figure from it is
 * copied into this header: a restated number is unfalsifiable from where it sits
 * and goes wrong the moment the tree moves, while a pointer stays true.
 *
 * The variance is live in this repository, not hypothetical: `GanttConfigSchema`
 * is CLOSED (unknown keys rejected) at the floor `@object-ui/types` declares and
 * OPEN at the floor `@object-ui/plugin-gantt` declares — one schema, two floors,
 * opposite answers. That was true when this was written; what re-derives it is
 * the two manifests' declared ranges read against the spec, never this sentence.
 *
 * One fact outlives that example, and anyone reading this section as a starting
 * point needs it before anything else: a key ABSENT from a schema does NOT imply
 * that the schema refuses it. Whether the schema is CLOSED decides that, and it
 * varies per schema AND per version. Deriving refusal from a key list is the
 * step that makes a naive version of this criterion confidently wrong.
 *
 * ## The defect class (objectui#5793)
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec@17.1.0` added exports that 17.0.0 does not have.
 * objectui#5494 then landed `packages/plugin-detail/src/renderers/
 * record-reference-rail.tsx`, whose published `dist/renderers/
 * record-reference-rail.d.ts` reads
 *
 *     import { ReferenceRailEntry } from '@objectstack/spec/ui';
 *     export type { ReferenceRailEntry } from '@objectstack/spec/ui';
 *
 * while `packages/plugin-detail/package.json` declared
 * `"@objectstack/spec": "^17.0.0"` — the same range every package in the
 * workspace declared, uniformly.
 *
 * A declared range is a PUBLIC CLAIM about what the package works against. Any
 * consumer resolution that lands 17.0.0 — a sibling pinning it exactly, an
 * `overrides` entry, an offline mirror a minor behind — satisfies `^17.0.0` and
 * gets a dangling type re-export. Normal installs resolve the newest 17.x and
 * never see it, which is precisely why nothing found this for a release and a
 * half: it is a floor-honesty defect, not a live breakage, and the lockfile
 * hides it from every green check in this repository.
 *
 * The direction was ruled on objectui#5793 (triage comment 5385335220): floors
 * track reality. "The uniform `^17.0.0` is deliberate" would be a maintainer
 * ruling and is NOT assumed here — the platform default is contract-tightening
 * over consumer tolerance.
 *
 * ## Two ways to build this gate that return a confident GREEN
 *
 * Both were live hazards on this card, and both are avoided by construction
 * rather than by care:
 *
 * 1. **Resolution answers the wrong question.** The ROOT `package.json`
 *    declares `@objectstack/spec`, so pnpm hoists it to the workspace root and
 *    Node's upward walk finds it from ANY package directory regardless of that
 *    package's own manifest. `require.resolve('@objectstack/spec/ui', { paths:
 *    [pkgDir] })` therefore succeeds everywhere, and a green `tsc` proves
 *    nothing whatsoever about a floor — it type-checks against the INSTALLED
 *    17.2.0, not against the declared minimum. This is the same trap
 *    `check-phantom-dependencies.mjs` records for `react`. So this gate
 *    resolves NOTHING through the installed tree: it fetches the declared
 *    minimum version from the registry and reads that tarball's own manifest.
 *
 * 2. **The dual-package halves are two different builds.** `@objectstack/spec`
 *    ships `require` → `dist/<entry>/index.js` and `import` →
 *    `dist/<entry>/index.mjs`, with separate type entries (`index.d.ts` /
 *    `index.d.mts`). Reaching the package through `createRequire` reads a build
 *    no bundler ever puts in an application. This gate walks the fetched
 *    manifest's own `exports` map under the **`import`** condition and prints
 *    the entry it landed on, so the artifact it judged is named in the log
 *    rather than assumed.
 *
 *    The two halves were measured on 17.0.0 `./ui` while this gate was written:
 *    `dist/ui/index.d.mts`, `dist/ui/index.d.ts` and the package's own published
 *    `api-surface/ui.json` each list 425 exported names with an empty symmetric
 *    difference. They agree today — which is a MEASUREMENT, not a licence to
 *    read whichever is convenient, because a divergence would be invisible to a
 *    gate that only ever read one. `--cross-check` re-runs that comparison over
 *    every entry the run consulted.
 *
 * ## Why the criterion is the ARTIFACT, not `src/`
 *
 * Reading `src/` is cheaper and needs no build, and it is wrong in the
 * direction that costs most here: a `import type` used only inside a function
 * body is ERASED and never reaches `dist/`, so a src-based gate would demand a
 * floor bump that nothing published justifies. The dispatch order for this card
 * is explicit that every range changed must be backed by a symbol the gate
 * names, and a gate that over-names symbols corrupts exactly that. `dist/` is
 * also the only thing that cannot be wrong about what a consumer installs —
 * the same argument `check-published-dist-tooling.mjs` makes at length.
 *
 * The cost of that choice is a build, so this gate is wired the way objectui's
 * other artifact-level gate is: the RELEASE path plus a nightly alarm, never a
 * per-PR job. The 2026-08-16 ruling on objectui#4846 rejected a per-PR
 * full-repo build, and nothing about this card reopens it. Its verdict logic is
 * exercised per-PR by `scripts/__tests__/check-spec-range-floors.test.ts`
 * against synthetic inputs.
 *
 * ## What is scanned, and the hole that exclusion could leave
 *
 * Symbol names are read out of the ESM artifacts — type declarations
 * (`.d.ts` / `.d.mts` / `.d.cts`) and ES modules — with TypeScript's parser.
 * The UMD/CJS bundle is NOT parsed for names: it reaches its externals as
 * minified property accesses on a factory parameter
 * (`e.ObjectUISpecData.FeedFilterMode`), so no symbol name survives in it.
 *
 * An exclusion is where a gate goes quietly blind, so it is guarded rather than
 * trusted: every spec SUBPATH mentioned anywhere in the artifact set — the UMD
 * bundle included, found by plain text scan — must also be covered by an
 * artifact the gate could name symbols in. A subpath that reaches consumers
 * only through a bundle this gate cannot read is a finding (`opaque-subpath`),
 * not a silent pass.
 *
 * ## Consumer-facing fields only
 *
 * `dependencies` / `peerDependencies` / `optionalDependencies` — the fields
 * `check-phantom-dependencies.mjs` calls RUNTIME_FIELDS, imported from there
 * rather than retyped. A `devDependencies` range is not installed for anybody
 * and floors nothing. A package whose artifact references spec while declaring
 * it ONLY as a dev dependency is a phantom dependency, which is that gate's
 * finding and deliberately not restated here.
 *
 * When more than one consumer-facing field declares the package, a consumer
 * install must satisfy all of them, so the effective floor is the HIGHEST of
 * their minimum versions.
