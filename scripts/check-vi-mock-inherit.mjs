/**
 * Rejects a `vi.mock` factory that HAND-LISTS the exports of a covered
 * workspace package instead of inheriting the real module's export surface.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-vi-mock-inherit.mjs
 *       node scripts/check-vi-mock-inherit.mjs --list   # every call site found
 *       node scripts/check-vi-mock-inherit.mjs --json
 * Exit: 0 = OK, 1 = a frozen factory, an unreadable one, or a collapsed
 *       population (see "Green at rest" below)
 *
 * ## The defect (objectui#6849, surfaced by #6768 / PR #6847)
 *
 * A factory that returns a hand-written object freezes the mock's export
 * surface at whatever the author typed that day:
 *
 *     vi.mock('@object-ui/react', () => ({ SchemaRenderer: Stub }));
 *
 * The real module keeps growing. The next export that any module in the file's
 * import graph reads AT MODULE SCOPE resolves to `undefined` against the frozen
 * stand-in, and the file dies during COLLECTION -- before a single test runs.
 *
 * That failure does not look like a test failure. Measured on #6768:
 *
 *     Test Files  3 failed | 546 passed
 *     Tests       6694 passed          <- ZERO failed assertions
 *
 * The tests in those three files never ran, so nothing failed. PR #6847's
 * ablation reproduced it in isolation: reverting one converted file gives
 * `Test Files 1 failed (1)` / `Tests no tests`, against 32 passing on the
 * converted form. A reader seeing that months later reads flake, and the bill
 * is paid by whoever added the export -- in a red suite that does not point at
 * them. That is why the sweep needed a gate behind it rather than a habit.
 *
 * ## The recogniser is SEMANTIC. A name match is wrong in BOTH directions
 *
 * #6768 was written from a grep for the literal `importOriginal` and counted 36
 * frozen sites. The true count was 25, and this gate's first run found the miss
 * in the other direction too. Both errors are measured, not argued:
 *
 *   - **False positives -- 11.** Eleven files already inherited the real
 *     surface under a different spelling: nine in `plugin-dashboard` spread
 *     `await vi.importActual('@object-ui/react')` from a ZERO-PARAMETER
 *     factory; `EnvironmentListToolbar.test.tsx` names its callback parameter
 *     `importActual`; `PageView.test.tsx` names it `orig`. A gate matching the
 *     name would have demanded edits to eleven correct files and been deleted
 *     by the first person it annoyed.
 *   - **A false negative -- 1.** `plugin-view`'s
 *     `ObjectView.contractEnvelope-6726.test.tsx` hand-listed four exports from
 *     a zero-parameter factory and contains the token `importOriginal` nowhere,
 *     so the grep could not see it. It was byte-identical at PR #6847's own
 *     commit (`1e14d70ae`) and the sweep passed over it. This gate's first run
 *     over the tree flagged it; the same PR converts it.
 *
 * So the criterion is a property of the CODE, never of a name:
 *
 *   1. does the factory OBTAIN the real module -- through a callback parameter
 *      under ANY name, or through `vi.importActual` of the SAME specifier; and
 *   2. does the obtained value get SPREAD into the returned object?
 *
 * Obtaining without spreading is still frozen: `const actual = await
 * importOriginal(); return { SchemaRenderer: Stub };` inherits nothing. Both
 * halves are required, and both are read off the factory's own text.
 *
 * ## Scope: a declared, GROW-ONLY set of covered specifiers
 *
 * Triage ruled this gate NARROW (objectui#6849, R+34): limited to widely-
 * imported workspace specifiers rather than every `vi.mock` factory, because
 * the measured failure mechanism is itself narrow -- it needs a real export
 * surface that GROWS. Three things are therefore out of scope by construction,
 * not by exemption:
 *
 *   - **Whole-module replacement of a local module.** `vi.mock('./ObjectCalendar',
 *     ...)` in `plugin-calendar/src/registration.test.tsx` replaces a component
 *     wholesale and says so in its own comment. There is no growing surface to
 *     inherit, and a gate that reddened on it would be deleted rather than
 *     fixed. Relative specifiers are counted here and never judged.
 *   - **Third-party packages.** `sonner`, `react-router-dom`, `lucide-react`
 *     and friends grow only on a deliberate version bump. Counted, never judged.
 *   - **Workspace specifiers not in `COVERED_SPECIFIERS`.** See below.
 *
 * `COVERED_SPECIFIERS` holds the workspace packages whose frozen sites have
 * actually been SWEPT to zero. Today that is fourteen, and each joined by sweep
 * rather than by judgement. Running this file's classifier over all 1,499
 * `vi.mock` call sites in the tree at `9ce20233f`:
 *
 *     covered set = @object-ui/react (swept by PR #6847)  ->    1 frozen
 *     covered set = every @object-ui/* workspace package  ->  299 frozen
 *
 * with `@object-ui/auth` at 92, `@object-ui/i18n` at 34, `@object-ui/collaboration`
 * at 25 and `@object-ui/components` at 22. Import breadth does not separate them
 * either -- `@object-ui/react` is THIRD by measured import count (576 imports
 * across 552 files), behind `@object-ui/core` and `@object-ui/types` -- so there
 * was no threshold to derive and no honest way to widen the set that day.
 *
 * ⚠️ Those per-specifier figures were taken with the FIRST-ANGLE-BRACKET
 * generic this file carried until objectui#7337, which mis-read a nested
 * `vi.importActual` generic and over-reported `frozen`; re-derive before acting
 * on any of them. `@object-ui/i18n` was the second member, swept and added by
 * objectui#7337 -- 92 judged call sites, 92 inheriting, 0 frozen at the flip,
 * with the all-specifier population moving 315 -> 314 frozen and no site moving
 * the other way.
 *
 * The next three members joined together as objectui#6892's first slice, the
 * three specifiers the worklist's triage named as the flow-proving start
 * because each carried exactly ONE frozen factory. Re-derived on `eeda78a780`
 * with the fixed classifier -- ⛔ never from the worklist's own table, which
 * predates both the recogniser fix and the `@object-ui/i18n` flip:
 *
 *     @object-ui/plugin-markdown    1 judged, 0 inheriting, 1 frozen -> 0
 *     @object-ui/data-objectstack   1 judged, 0 inheriting, 1 frozen -> 0
 *     @object-ui/plugin-report      1 judged, 0 inheriting, 1 frozen -> 0
 *
 * with the all-specifier population over the 22 specifiers any `vi.mock` call
 * site in the tree names moving 318 -> 315 frozen, and no site moving the other
 * way.
 *
 * The next two joined as objectui#6892's SECOND slice, re-derived on
 * `689127723` by the same method -- `scan()` imported with `covered` set to
 * every workspace specifier the tree names, so the constant below was never
 * widened-and-reverted:
 *
 *     @object-ui/plugin-charts      1 judged, 0 inheriting, 1 frozen -> 0
 *     @object-ui/plugin-dashboard   3 judged, 0 inheriting, 3 frozen -> 0
 *
 * with the same population moving 315 -> 311 frozen and, again, no site moving
 * the other way. `@object-ui/plugin-charts` never appeared on the worklist's
 * table at all, and the reason is a THIRD way that table goes stale, distinct
 * from both the recogniser fix and the sweeps: its only call site did not yet
 * exist. `ObjectView.chartConfigForward-7891.test.tsx` was ADDED by `38158c6bb`
 * (2026-09-06), a week AFTER the `9ce20233f` snapshot (2026-08-30) -- verified
 * by `git cat-file -e 9ce20233f:PATH` against a control path that resolves at
 * the same commit. So the population GROWS while the worklist is being worked,
 * and a slice scoped from the table alone would have missed this specifier
 * entirely. Re-derive per slice; never inherit.
 *
 * `@object-ui/auth` joined as objectui#6892's THIRD slice -- the largest block
 * on the worklist by a factor of three -- re-derived on `06761b351` by the same
 * `scan()` method, the constant below again never widened-and-reverted:
 *
 *     @object-ui/auth             135 judged, 33 inheriting, 102 frozen -> 0
 *
 * with the same population moving 311 -> 209 frozen and no site moving the
 * other way -- both figures measured on `06761b351`, the base this sweep was
 * derived and converted on. On the merged head the population reads 211 over
 * 643 judged, and the delta is NOT this sweep: merging `origin/main` mid-slice
 * brought in two new frozen sites (`@object-ui/plugin-form`, `@object-ui/plugin-grid`)
 * and one new inheriting `@object-ui/react` site, all landed by other PRs
 * while this one was being verified. That is the growth warning above,
 * observed a second time inside a single slice; `@object-ui/auth` stayed at 0.
 *
 * ⭐ That slice paid for one measurement worth keeping here, because
 * it is the question every REMAINING slice has to ask and the answer is not
 * uniform: **what does inheriting actually RUN?** Converting freezes to
 * inheritance loads the real barrel in every converted file, so a barrel with
 * module-scope side effects has those effects restored in all of them at once.
 * Slice 2's two barrels each made 8 module-scope `ComponentRegistry.register`
 * calls, absorbed in four files. `packages/auth/src` was measured before any
 * conversion, by walking its 22-module static import graph and classifying
 * every top-level statement: 8 module-scope initialisers, ALL pure in-memory
 * allocation (two `Set`s of literal strings, an `Object.values`, a `Set` over
 * it, `createContext(null)` plus its `displayName`, an empty listener `Set`,
 * one alias), and ZERO registrations, timers, globals, `fetch` or
 * side-effect-only imports. Inert -- so 102 files inherit it for free. ⛔ Do
 * not generalise that verdict to the next barrel; take the measurement. The
 * remaining 209 stay on objectui#6892, `@object-ui/collaboration` (33) and
 * `@object-ui/plugin-form` (30) next by yield and `@object-ui/app-shell` (23)
 * only after objectui#6580.
 *
 * `@object-ui/collaboration` joined as objectui#6892's FOURTH slice, re-derived
 * on `0caacca37` by the same `scan()` method, the constant below again never
 * widened-and-reverted:
 *
 *     @object-ui/collaboration     33 judged, 0 inheriting, 33 frozen -> 0
 *
 * with the population moving 211 -> 178 frozen over 643 judged and no site
 * moving the other way -- every other one of the 21 rows byte-identical between
 * the two runs. All 33 sites sit under `packages/app-shell` and all 33 are ONE
 * syntactic shape (the multi-line object-literal arrow), so this slice needed
 * none of the three-shape handling `@object-ui/auth` did.
 *
 * STEP 0 was taken again rather than inherited, and it differs from auth's in
 * the EVIDENCE available, not in the verdict. `packages/collaboration` is a
 * presence/realtime package -- `useRealtimeSubscription`, `usePresence`,
 * `PresenceProvider` -- which is exactly why the walk was the point rather than
 * a formality. Its 11-module static import graph from `index.ts` holds 11
 * module-scope initialisers, ALL pure in-memory allocation: two `let` counters
 * at 0, four style/label object literals, the `COLLAB_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS`
 * map, one `createSafeTranslation(...)` call that only closes over that map and
 * returns a hook, an empty `NOOP_SOURCE` object, and `React.createContext` of
 * it. Every `WebSocket`, `setTimeout` and `window.addEventListener` in the
 * package is indented inside a hook body, and the only RUNTIME workspace import
 * is `@object-ui/i18n` -- already covered by this gate and already loaded in
 * these tests. Inert, so 33 files inherit it for free.
 *
 * ⚠️ What auth had and this slice did NOT is the free confirmation. auth had 33
 * of its 135 sites already inheriting on `main`, which proved the real barrel
 * loads in that test environment before anything was converted;
 * `@object-ui/collaboration` had ZERO -- no test in the tree loaded the real
 * barrel at runtime. So the confirmation here is the suite run itself, which is
 * weaker evidence than a pre-existing green site, and is recorded as such. A
 * later slice on a specifier with 0 inheriting sites should expect the same and
 * budget the full suite accordingly.
 *
 * `@object-ui/plugin-form` joined as objectui#6892's FIFTH slice, re-derived
 * on `d5c1f527e` by the same `scan()` method, the constant below again never
 * widened-and-reverted:
 *
 *     @object-ui/plugin-form       32 judged, 1 inheriting, 31 frozen -> 0
 *
 * with the population moving 178 -> 147 frozen over 643 judged and no site
 * moving the other way -- every other one of the 21 rows byte-identical between
 * the two runs. Merging `origin/main` mid-slice then brought in a THIRTY-SECOND
 * frozen site on this same specifier (`plugin-view`'s
 * `ObjectView.expandFls-7429.test.tsx` -- landed by objectui#7429), swept in the
 * same PR: on the merged head the specifier reads 33 judged, 33 inheriting, 0
 * frozen and the population reads 148 over 654. That is the growth warning
 * above firing for the THIRD consecutive slice, and it is the reason the
 * constant may only be widened by a run of this gate on the tree that ships,
 * never by the derivation taken on the base.
 *
 * This is the first slice whose sites span THREE owning packages
 * (20 under `packages/plugin-view`, 8 under `packages/app-shell`, 4 under
 * `packages/plugin-designer`) and the first to meet a THIRD syntactic shape:
 * four `plugin-designer` sites delegated the whole factory to a shared manual
 * mock module (`() => import('./__mocks__/plugin-form')`), which inherits
 * nothing. Those become an async factory that spreads the real barrel FIRST and
 * the manual mock module SECOND, so the hand-written `ModalForm` / `DrawerForm`
 * still win and every other export is the real one.
 *
 * STEP 0 was taken again rather than inherited, and here it found what the two
 * previous barrels did not: `packages/plugin-form/src` is NOT inert. Its
 * 28-module static import graph from `index.tsx` holds 75 module-scope
 * statements, and six of them are `ComponentRegistry.register(...)` calls in
 * the barrel itself (`object-form`, `form`, `embeddable-form`,
 * `form-analytics`, `object-master-detail-form`, `line_items`). The slice
 * proceeded anyway, and the reason is the class of the effect rather than its
 * absence: `register()` is a `Map.set` into an in-memory registry plus a
 * `console.warn` on the un-namespaced spelling, all six pass a namespace, and
 * this is the same effect slice 2 absorbed for `plugin-charts` and
 * `plugin-dashboard`. The other 69 statements are pure allocation -- `Set`s of
 * literal strings, style and threshold literals, one regular expression, four
 * `createSafeTranslation(...)` factory calls (already measured pure by slice 3)
 * and four `elementDataSourceBlock(...)` marks into a module-level `Set` in
 * `@object-ui/core`. ZERO timers, globals, storage, `fetch`, connections, and
 * zero side-effect-only imports; two column-anchored greps over all 28 modules
 * agree with the walk exactly. The registry question the ruling asks was also
 * answered on the CONSUMING side: of the 31 converted files exactly one names
 * `ComponentRegistry` at all, and it READS one entry (`get('object-view')`)
 * rather than asserting emptiness or a count, so no converted assertion can be
 * broken by the six new entries.
 *
 * ⭐ Unlike `@object-ui/collaboration`, this specifier DID have the free
 * confirmation: `packages/app-shell/src/views/studio-design/StudioDesignSurface.formFields.test.tsx`
 * already inherited the real barrel on `main` and passed, so the real module
 * was known to load in that environment before anything was converted.
 *
 * `@object-ui/components` joined as objectui#6892's SIXTH slice, re-derived on
 * `336a9eb8a` by the same `scan()` method, the constant below again never
 * widened-and-reverted:
 *
 *     @object-ui/components        47 judged, 20 inheriting, 27 frozen -> 0
 *
 * with the population moving 150 -> 123 frozen over 659 judged and no site
 * moving the other way -- every other one of the 21 rows byte-identical between
 * the two runs. The 27 sites sit in three owning packages (24 under
 * `packages/app-shell`, 2 under `packages/plugin-detail`, 1 under
 * `packages/plugin-timeline`) and in three syntactic shapes: 16 object-literal
 * arrows, 6 block-bodied arrows with a `return`, and 5 that were ALREADY
 * `async` and still frozen -- they awaited something OTHER than the module
 * under mock (React, or one deep-relative source module) and returned a
 * hand-listed object, which is the shape a name-matching gate would wave
 * through and this one does not.
 *
 * STEP 0 was taken again rather than inherited, and this barrel is the largest
 * yet measured: 205 modules and 1173 module-scope statements reached from
 * `packages/components/src/index.ts`. It is NOT inert, and it was not expected
 * to be -- objectui#7837 had already counted the registrations. What decided
 * the slice is the CLASS of the effect, measured three ways. Statically: 112
 * module-scope `ComponentRegistry.register(...)` call sites, every one of them
 * carrying a namespace (`ui` 85, `element` 10, `page` 7, `action` 5, plus the
 * loop-driven `protocol-placeholder` marks), so the deprecation `console.warn`
 * in `register()` cannot fire; `register()` itself is a `Map.set` plus that
 * warn plus a `notify()` over a listener `Set` that is empty at import time.
 * Beyond registration there is exactly ONE non-allocation statement in the
 * whole graph -- `hooks/related-count-store.ts` calls `subscribeDataChanges`,
 * which `packages/react/src/data-invalidation.ts` implements as a `Set.add`
 * into a module-level listener set: no timer, no window listener, no request.
 * Two column-anchored greps over all 205 modules agree: the
 * timers/globals/storage/network/DOM grep matches nothing, and the
 * IDENT.method grep returns the register lines and nothing else. Empirically:
 * importing the real barrel in the happy-dom environment registers 295 keys
 * over 159 `register()` calls and emits ZERO `console.warn` and ZERO
 * `console.error`. The consuming side was checked for the failure class the
 * worklist names -- of the 27 converted files NONE names `ComponentRegistry`
 * at all, and the six `console.warn` spies among them are all installed inside
 * `it(...)` bodies (after import) AND filter by message content, so no
 * assertion can see a registration.
 *
 * ⚠️ The ONE side-effect import in the barrel is a CSS import
 * (`./sidebar-fixes.css`, plain CSS by construction -- the barrel's own comment
 * explains why the Tailwind entry is deliberately NOT imported there). The root
 * Vitest config declares no `css` option, so CSS is not processed and the
 * import is inert in jsdom. That is corroborated rather than argued: 20 sites
 * on this specifier already inherited the real barrel on `main` and passed, 8
 * of them in `packages/app-shell` under the LIGHT `dom` project -- the free
 * confirmation slice 4 did not have.
 *
 * ⭐ This slice is the first where inheriting made converted files DIE during
 * collection, which is the failure this whole worklist exists to describe,
 * observed from the other side. 15 of the 27 died at once, all on one cause:
 * the real barrel reaches `notifications/severity.ts`, which reads four icons
 * from `lucide-react` AT MODULE SCOPE into a `const` -- and those 15 files
 * carried their own frozen `lucide-react` factory that had never listed them.
 * Nothing in product source was touched: the repair is the neighbouring
 * FACTORY, converted to the same inheriting form (spread the real module
 * first, keep every hand-written icon stub after it), which is why a frozen
 * third-party factory can be the thing that blocks a workspace-specifier
 * sweep even though this gate never judges it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Inheriting is NOT free here, and the cost is recorded rather than
 * absorbed silently. The `dom`/`dom-heavy` project split exists precisely to
 * keep this package's graph out of the light project's setup, so a converted
 * file now pulls it through its own imports instead. Measured on one app-shell
 * file, twice each: 6.17s / 5.97s frozen, 8.72s / 9.36s inheriting both the
 * barrel and `lucide-react`. See the slice's pull request for the whole-package
 * figure.
 *
 * `@object-ui/plugin-grid` joined as objectui#6892's SEVENTH slice, re-derived
 * on `21d7989fb` by the same `scan()` method, the constant below again never
 * widened-and-reverted:
 *
 *     @object-ui/plugin-grid       25 judged, 0 inheriting, 25 frozen -> 0
 *
 * with the population moving 123 -> 98 frozen over 659 judged and no site
 * moving the other way -- every other one of the 21 rows byte-identical between
 * the two runs. The 25 sites sit in two owning packages (21 under
 * `packages/plugin-view`, 4 under `packages/plugin-designer`) and in two
 * syntactic shapes: 21 object-literal arrows -- 15 of them the SAME single line
 * byte-for-byte -- and the 4 designer sites delegating the whole factory to a
 * shared manual mock module, the shape slice 5 first met.
 *
 * STEP 0 was taken again rather than inherited, and this graph is the largest
 * yet measured on this worklist: 560 modules and 1421 module-scope statements
 * reached from `packages/plugin-grid/src/index.tsx` -- larger than slice 6's
 * barrel because this one reaches `@object-ui/components`, `@object-ui/fields`,
 * `@object-ui/react`, `@object-ui/core`, `@object-ui/permissions`,
 * `@object-ui/mobile` and `@object-ui/i18n`. It is NOT inert, and the slice
 * proceeded on the CLASS of the effect. Statically: 114 module-scope
 * `ComponentRegistry.register(...)` call sites, every one carrying a namespace
 * (`ui` 89, `element` 10, `page` 7, `action` 5, `plugin-grid` 2, `view` 1 --
 * the five in `renderers/layout/page.tsx` that read as bare carry `ui` through
 * the spread `pageMeta` constant), so the deprecation `console.warn` in
 * `register()` cannot fire. THREE effects this worklist had not met before, all
 * in `packages/fields/src/index.tsx` and all the same benign class: five
 * `registerFieldRenderer(...)` calls that are a `Map.set` into a module-level
 * registry, one `setCellRendererResolver(...)` that assigns a module-level
 * `let`, and `registerAllFields()`, which loops the widget map into
 * `ComponentRegistry.register` under the `field` namespace. Beyond registration
 * the graph holds only allocation -- 171 `React.forwardRef`, 94 `new Set`, 21
 * `createContext`, 15 `Object.freeze`, 14 `new Map`, 13 `cva`, 10
 * `createDiscardProofCache` (a `new WeakMap` plus a closure) and nine
 * module-scope `new` singletons whose constructors were READ and assign fields
 * only (`UndoManager`'s `localStorage` path is a method nothing calls at import).
 * ZERO timers, globals, storage, `fetch` or connections. Empirically: importing
 * the real barrel under happy-dom moves `ComponentRegistry.getAllTypes()` from
 * 0 to 375 keys, exports 20 names, and emits ZERO `console.warn` and ZERO
 * `console.error`.
 *
 * ⚠️ Two column-anchored greps corroborate the walk with ONE disagreement worth
 * recording, because it is the grep that is wrong: four `self.addEventListener`
 * lines match at column 0 in `packages/mobile/src/serviceWorkerSource.ts`, and
 * all four sit INSIDE the template literal that module returns as generated
 * service-worker SOURCE. They are never executed by importing anything. The AST
 * walk does not report them; a column-anchored grep cannot see template-literal
 * nesting. Prefer the parser, and record the disagreement rather than the
 * quieter number.
 *
 * The consuming side was checked for the failure class the worklist names: of
 * the 25 converted files exactly ONE names `ComponentRegistry` at all, and it
 * READS one entry -- `get('object-view')`, a key `packages/plugin-view`'s own
 * index registers, not one this barrel claims -- rather than asserting
 * emptiness or a count. Not one of the 25 installs a `console.warn` or
 * `console.error` spy. So no converted assertion can be broken by the 375 keys.
 *
 * ⚠️ Like `@object-ui/collaboration`, this specifier had ZERO already-inheriting
 * sites, so there was no free confirmation -- the suite runs themselves are the
 * evidence, and that is weaker than a pre-existing green site.
 *
 * ⭐ The collection-death failure class slice 6 met did NOT fire here, and the
 * reason is worth carrying rather than reading as luck. Every one of the 25
 * files carries neighbouring factories -- 25 on `@object-ui/plugin-form`, 21 on
 * `@object-ui/react`, one on `@object-ui/permissions` -- and ALL of them were
 * already inheriting, swept by slices 3, 5 and 6 or written that way. There is
 * not a single frozen THIRD-PARTY factory in the 25. Slice 6's 15 deaths came
 * from frozen `lucide-react` neighbours; a specifier whose sites have none
 * inherits cleanly. Check the neighbours before budgeting for the repair.
 *
 * ⚠️ Cost, measured the same way slice 6 measured it -- one converted
 * `plugin-view` file, twice each: 9.53s / 8.37s frozen, 10.17s / 9.91s
 * inheriting. The ~1.1s marginal cost is far below slice 6's ~3s, and for a
 * structural reason: these files ALREADY inherit the real `@object-ui/react`
 * and `@object-ui/plugin-form` barrels, whose graphs already pull
 * `@object-ui/components`. Inheriting a barrel is cheap once its own
 * dependencies are already loaded in that file.
 *
 * `@object-ui/permissions` joined as objectui#6892's EIGHTH slice, re-derived
 * on `571b4870d` by the same `scan()` method, the constant below again never
 * widened-and-reverted:
 *
 *     @object-ui/permissions       48 judged, 24 inheriting, 24 frozen -> 0
 *
 * with the population moving 98 -> 74 frozen over 659 judged and no site moving
 * the other way -- every other one of the 21 rows byte-identical between the
 * two runs. The 24 frozen sites sit in four owning packages (17 under
 * `packages/app-shell`, 4 under `packages/plugin-grid`, 2 under
 * `packages/plugin-detail`, 1 under `packages/plugin-form`) and in two
 * syntactic shapes: 23 zero-parameter object-literal arrows and one that was
 * ALREADY `async` and still frozen -- it awaited `react`, not the module under
 * mock, which is the shape a name-matching gate waves through.
 *
 * STEP 0 was taken again rather than inherited, and this barrel is the SMALLEST
 * yet measured on this worklist and the first to come back genuinely INERT
 * since `@object-ui/collaboration`: 27 modules and 422 module-scope statements
 * reached from `packages/permissions/src/index.ts` -- the package plus
 * `@object-ui/types`, and nothing else in the workspace. It is a 43-line
 * re-export-only barrel, and a verdict on one of those is NOT free: what it
 * re-exports is what runs. Of the 422 statements exactly 18 execute anything,
 * and every one is allocation: ten `createDiscardProofCache()` calls (a
 * `new WeakMap` plus a returned closure -- read at the definition, not
 * assumed), one `createContext(null)` with its `displayName` assignment, three
 * `new Set` of literals, one `Object.freeze` of a literal, one `new WeakMap`,
 * and one `Symbol.for('objectui.inflightGet')`. That last one is the only
 * effect that leaves the module, and it is the global SYMBOL REGISTRY rather
 * than a global property: interning is idempotent, stores no value, and the
 * empirical run confirms it puts nothing on `globalThis` (the probe's own
 * `getOwnPropertySymbols(globalThis)` does not contain it). ZERO
 * `ComponentRegistry.register` calls -- the first swept barrel with none --
 * ZERO timers, globals, storage, `fetch`, connections, side-effect-only
 * imports and CSS. Two column-anchored greps over all 27 modules agree with the
 * walk EXACTLY, with no disagreement to record this time. Empirically:
 * importing the real barrel under happy-dom in the light `dom` project exports
 * 7 names, costs ~0.47s and emits ZERO `console.warn` and ZERO `console.error`.
 *
 * ⭐ The free confirmation is back, and it is the strongest this worklist has
 * had: 24 of the 48 sites -- exactly half, spread over TWELVE packages --
 * already inherited the real barrel on `main` and passed, so the real module
 * was known to load in the environment before anything was converted. All 48
 * sites are `.test.tsx` and NONE is in `heavyDomTests`, so all 48 run in the
 * single light `dom` project and one environment is the whole answer.
 *
 * ⭐ Slice 6's collection-death class did NOT fire, and the neighbour reading
 * says why in advance rather than after the fact. The 24 files carry 8 frozen
 * `sonner` factories and 7 frozen `@object-ui/plugin-list` ones -- the exact
 * shape that killed 15 files in slice 6 -- but this barrel's graph reaches
 * NEITHER, because it reaches nothing beyond `@object-ui/types`, `react` and
 * `@objectstack/spec`. A frozen neighbour is dangerous only when the newly-real
 * module's graph reaches it; walk the graph, then read the neighbours against
 * it.
 *
 * `@object-ui/plugin-detail` joined as objectui#6892's NINTH slice, re-derived
 * on `310c0ab19` by the same `scan()` method, the constant below again never
 * widened-and-reverted:
 *
 *     @object-ui/plugin-detail     17 judged, 4 inheriting, 13 frozen -> 0
 *
 * with the population moving 74 -> 61 frozen over 659 judged and no site moving
 * the other way. The 13 frozen sites sit in three owning packages (8 under
 * `packages/plugin-gantt`, 4 under `packages/plugin-calendar`, 1 under
 * `packages/plugin-tree`) and in ONE syntactic shape -- all 13 are
 * zero-parameter object-literal arrows, the most uniform surface this worklist
 * has swept.
 *
 * ⭐ The import-cost reading this slice owed, and why an isolated probe would
 * have answered it WRONG. Both `vitest.config.mts` and `apps/console`'s config
 * alias this specifier to `packages/plugin-detail/src`, so `importOriginal`
 * transforms the barrel's graph on demand -- and that graph is the LARGEST this
 * worklist has walked: 564 modules and 6,181 module-scope statements, carrying
 * 127 `ComponentRegistry.register` calls and 99 bare side-effect imports, the
 * latter almost entirely the `@object-ui/components` renderer cascade. Timed
 * COLD in an otherwise-empty test file, `importOriginal` of this barrel costs a
 * median of 8.8s (8815ms / 8646ms / 8827ms) -- squarely in objectui#6580's
 * ~10s `@object-ui/app-shell` range, which the dispatch defined as a STOP.
 *
 * ⛔ That number is an ARTEFACT of the empty file, and acting on it would have
 * stopped a free conversion. Measured on the REAL files instead -- the only
 * measurement that decides anything -- the marginal cost is roughly zero:
 * gantt 9.81s frozen -> 9.73s inheriting, tree 9.65s -> 9.84s, calendar 9.32s
 * -> 10.32s, i.e. -0.1s to +1.0s per file, the `@object-ui/plugin-grid` range
 * and not objectui#6580's. The mechanism is a SUBSET relation, and it is
 * measured rather than argued: every one of these 13 files already imports
 * `@object-ui/react` and its own view component (`./ObjectGantt` and friends)
 * at module scope, and those two together reach 572 modules -- a strict
 * SUPERSET of the barrel's 564, with `comm -23` reporting exactly ZERO modules
 * that inheriting adds. `importOriginal` here resolves an already-resident
 * graph; it loads nothing new.
 *
 * ⇒ CARRY-FORWARD, and it generalises past this specifier: a barrel's import
 * cost is NOT a property of the barrel. Measure it in the files that will pay
 * it, against what they already load, and never from a probe that imports the
 * barrel alone -- the probe answers "what does this graph cost from cold",
 * which is the wrong question whenever the consuming file already holds it.
 *
 * The neighbours in these 13 files are 7 frozen `sonner` factories plus 12
 * local whole-module replacements (`./GanttView` 8, `./CalendarView` 4), all
 * out of scope by construction, and slice 6's collection-death class again did
 * not fire: this barrel's graph reaches neither `sonner` nor those local
 * modules. ZERO neighbouring repairs.
 *
 * The remaining 61 stay on objectui#6892: `@object-ui/app-shell` (23, ALL
 * frozen, PARKED under objectui#8173 -- objectui#6892 and the closed
 * objectui#6580 point opposite ways on that one specifier and a seat does not
 * decide it), `@object-ui/plugin-chatbot` (11), `@object-ui/plugin-designer`
 * (10), `@object-ui/plugin-list` (9) and `@object-ui/fields` (8).
 *
 * **The precondition for widening is a sweep, not a judgement.** Convert a
 * specifier's frozen factories to the inheriting form, confirm this gate reads
 * zero for it, then add it to `COVERED_SPECIFIERS` in the same PR. The list only
 * ever grows. objectui#6892 carries the per-specifier worklist.
 *
 * ⛔ There is deliberately NO per-file exception list, and adding one is the
 * wrong repair. An exemption means the recogniser called correct code broken;
 * fix the recogniser, or the specifier does not belong in the covered set yet.
 *
 * ## Green at rest, and what follows from that
 *
 * Once the one site above is converted this gate reads zero, and on any
 * ordinary day its output is indistinguishable from a gate that matches
 * nothing -- which is the defect it exists to catch, one level up. Three
 * consequences, all load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. **The population must refuse to collapse.** A walk that finds no source
 *      files, no test files, or no covered call sites is a broken walk, not a
 *      clean tree. `FLOORS` turns each into a failure. Same discipline as
 *      `check-vi-mock-specifiers.mjs` and objectui#6195.
 *   2. **The verdict line carries the census**, so a reader sees the population
 *      the green was computed over.
 *   3. **A factory the gate cannot READ is a failure, never a pass.** An
 *      unbalanced argument list (`unreadable`) or a factory passed as some
 *      other expression (`indirect` -- a helper call, a shared constant) is
 *      reported and fails. Both are zero on this tree; letting either through
 *      silently would leave the obvious way to evade the gate wide open.
 *
 * `scripts/__tests__/check-vi-mock-inherit.test.ts` carries the ablation --
 * every already-correct spelling as a negative control, and a deliberately
 * hand-listed factory as the positive one -- because on a swept tree the run
 * itself proves nothing.
 *
 * ## Only text the language would EXECUTE is judged
 *
 * Comments are blanked and a call whose `vi` token sits inside a string is
 * classified `embedded` and counted, never judged -- both through one pass of
 * the shared `js-comment-mask.mjs`, exactly as the sibling gate does it, and
 * for the same reasons (this file's own header quotes the defect in prose).
 *
 * ## `js-comment-mask` USED to read a JSX closing tag as a regex literal
 *
 * Kept as measured history: it is why the shared module was fixed, and the two
 * behavioural cases in this gate's test still pin the outcome.
 *
 * The shared masker decided a `/` opens a regex when the preceding character is
 * not a value. In `</div>` the preceding character is `<`, so it opened a
 * PHANTOM regex that ran to the end of the line and swallowed whatever was
 * there -- including the `)` that closes a `vi.mock` call.
 *
 * That was not hypothetical here: measured on this tree at the time, SEVEN
 * `vi.mock` call sites in five files could not have their argument list
 * delimited at all because of it, one of them a covered `@object-ui/react` site
 * (`plugin-dashboard/src/__tests__/ObjectDataTable.cells.test.tsx`). The sibling
 * gate never noticed because it only reads the specifier; this gate reads the
 * factory BODY, so it could not.
 *
 * This gate carried a LOCAL workaround for it -- `deJsxClosingTags`, a
 * length-preserving rewrite of every closing tag applied before masking. The
 * shared masker itself was then fixed by objectui#6891 (CLOSED, PR #7880),
 * which taught `scanSource` that a `/` whose immediately preceding byte is `<`
 * opens nothing. Re-measured on the fixed masker, the raw source with the
 * rewrite NOT applied has ZERO undelimitable sites and the gate's verdict is
 * byte-identical either way, so the workaround was retired by objectui#7883.
 * ⛔ That is not "the masker is correct on JSX": objectui#6891 closed only the
 * `<` `/` half. A `/` after `}` or `>` -- a self-closing tag, a `/` in JSX text
 * -- still opens a phantom; that half is objectui#7882 and is still open. The
 * retired rewrite never covered it either (its pattern matched closing tags
 * only), which is why removing it lost no coverage.

nothing, a filter inverted, the pattern stopped matching, or a specifier in
\`COVERED_SPECIFIERS\` was renamed and now matches no call site at all. Fix the
walk. If a floor is genuinely too high because the tree changed shape, move it in
