/**
 * objectui#9159 — the drill escape hatch can finally SPELL "this dimension is
 * empty", and these assert it end to end.
 *
 * `buildDatasetDrillFilter`'s output has three consumers. Two lower it through
 * `convertFiltersToAST`, where objectui#9085's `{ field: { $null: true } }`
 * becomes `[field, 'is_null', true]` and the empty bucket selects its own rows.
 * The third is this one — the host's `openRecordList`, which serializes the same
 * object into `filter[...]` params for the ADR-0055 bare data surface. That
 * dialect had equality plus four range bounds and nothing else, so the condition
 * simply vanished: the empty-bucket drill and the non-empty one produced
 * BYTE-IDENTICAL query strings, and escalating an empty bucket to the list page
 * landed on a SUPERSET — silently, with chips that showed only the conditions
 * that survived, so the page looked correctly scoped
 * (`drillEmptyBucketNavHost-9085.test.ts` recorded that boundary; it now records
 * the repair).
 *
 * ## Why the observation point is the DESTINATION SCOPE, not the serializer
 *
 * The defect's whole signature was that every layer looked healthy — the widget
 * rendered, the navigation happened, the list loaded, and only the row set was
 * wrong. So the escape hatch is driven for real (`useOpenRecordList` inside a
 * router, the same harness `useOpenRecordList.placeholderScope-9022.test.tsx`
 * uses) and the assertion is on the triples the bare data surface reads back out
 * of the URL via this repo's own `parseUrlFilterTriples` — a round trip, never
 * the two operator maps in isolation. A map-only assertion passes on a dialect
 * that still cannot express the condition end to end.
 *
 * The filter under test is built by the real `buildDatasetDrillFilter`, so these
 * pin the shape a producer actually hands over rather than a hand-written
 * literal no caller emits.
 *
 * ## The flag is not data, and `false` is not a second operator
 *
 * `filter[<field>][null]` carries a FLAG: only the exact `true` spelling is the
 * is-null condition. `...[null]=false` is NOT "is not null" — the write side
 * cannot spell that operator, so the read side refuses to invent it and drops
 * the param the same way it drops an unknown suffix, leaving the drill degraded
 * to a superset exactly as it was before this card. Pinned below so the read
 * side has no unspecified input.
