/**
 * objectui#4823 — the test for `scripts/check-doc-component-types.mjs`.
 *
 * The gate answers one question: does every `type` string literal in a
 * `content/docs/**` code block — `.mdx` and `.md` alike — name a component this
 * repository actually registers. Nothing rendered or parsed those snippets before it, so the same
 * defect landed three times (objectui#4786 `stats-card`, objectui#4796
 * `plugin:grid` and `plugin:map`) and CI was green through all three.
 *
 * What this file pins, in the order the gate can go wrong:
 *
 *  1. **The registry derivation**, because a key it MISSES turns correct
 *     documentation red — the expensive direction. Every registration form the
 *     repo uses is fixtured, including the two that a naive scan gets wrong: a
 *     `skipFallback` belonging to the NEXT call, and a registration quoted
 *     inside a comment or a string.
 *  2. **The verdicts**, over throwaway trees rather than this repository, so
 *     they stay decidable when the docs move.
 *  3. **The exemption table is load-bearing and re-derived, never trusted.**
 *  4. **The scan cannot collapse quietly** — an empty walk would make every
 *     assertion vacuous.
 *  5. **This repository is green**, and the three snippets the first run of this
 *     gate found stay fixed.
 *  6. **The gate is wired** where the other install-free gates are, and where a
 *     docs-only pull request can start it.
 *
 * Fixtures are temporary trees, never the real `content/docs`: a committed
 * fixture page would have to contain a deliberately wrong `type`, and this very
 * gate would then scan it.

 *  1. The objectui#5002 family replaced eight plugin pages' fictional
 *     registration loops with a markdown KEY TABLE. The new form is right, and
 *     it landed entirely outside a scan surface that reads fenced code only — so
 *     a fake key in a table was GREEN while the same fake key in a fence was RED.
 *  2. The gate never judged a NAMESPACE at all. It compared bare keys against a
 *     universe that merely happens to contain namespaced ones, so flipping a
 *     registration's `namespace` left every doc that teaches the old namespace
 *     green.
 *
 * The false-positive corpus in `does not read a table that is not a key table`
 * is the reason the anchor is the table HEADER rather than the row shape, and it
 * is taken from this repository rather than invented — see the gate's header for
 * the measurement (33 rows matched by the row heuristic, only 22 of them keys).

   * objectui#7448. The header of this workflow described its scan surface as

   * time the card was worked — the gate's own verdict line reported 188 doc
   * files, and the `.md` half of the split was four short — and NO check went
   * red over the whole distance, because nothing fails on a stale number written
   * in a comment. That is the same lesson `UNGATED_DOCS`'s header in
   * `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs` records after both halves of its own copied
   * count went stale ("a pointer to the list now rather than a copy of its
   * length").
   *
   * Changing 184 to 188 would only have restarted that clock. This is what makes
   * the class fail loudly instead: the header may state the population — which
   * trees, which extensions — but never count it. `doc-fence-languages.yml`
   * carries the twin of this pin in its own test file; one gate, one home, so
   * each workflow's header is asserted beside its own gate rather than in a
   * shared sweep that would own neither.
   *
   * Deliberately narrow, and narrow in the same place as the other two copies:
   * a numeral qualifying a document-population noun, with at most two words
   * allowed to sit between the two. Issue references (ruled out at the pattern
   * level by the negative lookbehind, not by luck), `node-version`,
   * `timeout-minutes` and "the fifth instance of the shape" are all numbers
   * this header legitimately carries, and
   * none of them rots when a page is added or deleted. It also means the header
   * must not quote another header's stale literal verbatim — this pin cannot
   * tell a quotation from a claim, and refusing both is the safe direction for a
   * check on prose accuracy.
   *
   * ⭐ Those two intervening words are objectui#7888, and they are the sentence
   * above implemented rather than a new rule. This pin and its twin in
   * `check-doc-fence-languages.test.ts` both said "a numeral DIRECTLY
   * qualifying" and both coded it as strict adjacency, so a single adjective
   * defeated them. Measured: run verbatim over `check-links.yml`'s header as it
   * stood on `origin/main` at `83fe6e741` — a header carrying TWO live drifted
   * counts — the adjacent-only pattern reported ONE of them. It found the
   * sentence about the files the published site is built from, and scored the
   * one reading "holds 15 INTERNAL documents" clean — which was the count that
   * had drifted furthest (15 against a measured 17), because an adjective sat
   * between the numeral and the noun. The pattern below is the third copy's,
   * carried here verbatim (objectui#7825, PR objectui#7885,
   * `check-links-workflow.test.ts`), with the noun set unchanged; the word
   * DIRECTLY is gone from the sentence above because keeping it would only have
