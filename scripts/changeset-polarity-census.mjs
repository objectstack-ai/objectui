 * Changeset polarity census (objectui#9727) -- the REBUILT instrument.
 *
 * Run:  pnpm census:changeset-polarity            (markdown report)
 *       pnpm census:changeset-polarity --json     (machine readable)
 *       node scripts/changeset-polarity-census.mjs --corpus <dir> --types <dir>
 * Exit: 0 = the census ran (findings do NOT fail it -- report-only by design)
 *       1 = an input could not be read, so this run MEASURED NOTHING
 *       2 = a control failed, so this run's zeros are not evidence of absence
 *
 * ## Why this script exists at all, and what it replaces
 *
 * objectui#9713 repaired two pending changeset entries whose PRESENT-TENSE
 * claims about what a schema declares had gone false. objectui#9727 carries the
 * derived question -- how many more are there -- as a CANDIDATE SET rather than
 * a defect list, and it carries it with two admissions from the instrument's
 * own author:
 *
 *   1. the numbers on that card are TRANSCRIBED. The producing script lived in
 *      a worktree that was cleaned up, so nothing on the card is re-derivable.
 *   2. the instrument had a PROVEN FALSE NEGATIVE on the site that motivated
 *      the card.
 *
 * Neither of those is repairable by reading the card harder. This file is the
 * instrument rebuilt so it runs from a clean checkout, so its answer is
 * re-derivable by anyone, and so the known blindness is closed and PINNED.
 * It repairs no changeset body and is wired into no workflow: `census:*` is
 * this tree's spelling for "runnable, reported, not blocking" (the reasoning is
 * `scripts/cross-file-line-citation-census.mjs`'s, and is not restated here).
 *
 * Per commandment #9 this header states NO count. The number is whatever the
 * script prints on the tree you run it against; objectui#9727's transcribed 154
 * is a reading of a tree and an instrument that no longer exist.
 *
 * ## The population (P)
 *
 * DOMAIN: every sentence of every pending `.changeset/*.md` except `README.md`.
 * PREDICATE: the sentence names a schema symbol AND carries a PRESENT-TENSE
 * declaration verb. Bare past `declared` is excluded on purpose -- a past-tense
 * sentence is historical and cannot rot, which is the distinction objectui#9713
 * turns on. Present-tense PASSIVE (`is declared`, `are not declared`) is
 * INCLUDED: it is a live claim about today's tree and rots exactly like the
 * active voice.
 *
 * ## Four properties this rebuild has that the transcribed instrument did not
 *
 * 1. WHOLE-FILE READ, whitespace-tolerant. Changeset prose wraps near eighty
 *    columns, so a line-anchored probe is structurally blind to any claim that
 *    wraps -- and a claim naming a schema and a key is long enough that most of
 *    them do. Lines are joined per paragraph, continuation prefixes (blockquote
 *    markers, list bullets) are stripped first, and all runs of whitespace
 *    collapse before a sentence is cut. A TABLE is the exception and is read as
 *    structure, not as wrapped prose (objectui#9870): its cells are separate
 *    units of text and its header is what tells a column apart from a sentence.
 *
 * 2. ASSERTION POSITION vs QUOTED POSITION. A count over prose is NOT
 *    invariant under quotation, and treating it as invariant is how a repaired
 *    site gets re-flagged forever: objectui#9713's repair QUOTES the sentence it
 *    retires, inside the note that retires it. A sentence reached through a
 *    fence, a blockquote, guillemets or quotation marks is in QUOTED position --
 *    it is counted, reported, and never flagged. Only an ASSERTION is a
 *    candidate. A third position joins them (objectui#9870): a cell in a column
 *    the table's own header declares SUPERSEDED stands where a quotation
 *    stands, and for a reason quotation cannot express -- the retired reading is
 *    not quoted, it is tabulated.
 *
 * 3. A NAME IS NOT A KEY -- A KEY IS (interface, name). Membership is resolved
 *    against the member set of the SCHEMA THE SENTENCE NAMES, built with the
 *    TypeScript parser over `packages/types/src` (both faces: the `interface`
 *    and its zod mirror), with `extends` resolved transitively. A key that is
 *    merely declared SOMEWHERE is not a member here.
 *    An inherited INDEX SIGNATURE (`[key: string]: any` on `BaseSchema`) is
 *    deliberately NOT membership. A key riding the index signature is admitted
 *    and never examined, which is the condition the whole family of cards is
 *    about; counting it as declared would erase the finding.
 *
 * 4. THE CROSS-SENTENCE PRONOUN, which is the blindness this card names. The
 *    site that motivated objectui#9727 reads, across a sentence boundary:
 *
 *        "... the only one that refused `allowCollapse` / ... / `onCardAdd` by
 *        name ... The surviving `ObjectKanbanSchema` face declares none of
 *        them."
 *
 *    The claim's object is `them`. A matcher that reads only the sentence
 *    carrying the verb finds a schema, finds no key, and reports nothing -- so
 *    the instrument missed THE SITE IT WAS BUILT FROM. Its output was a FLOOR
 *    and was never a census. Here, a matched sentence whose object is a pronoun
 *    (`them`, `these`, `those`, `none of them`, `either`, `both`) and which
 *    carries no backticked key of its own resolves its keys from the nearest
 *    preceding sentence in the same paragraph that names any.
 *    `scripts/__tests__/changeset-polarity-census.test.ts` pins that site by its
 *    PRE-REPAIR text: the pin goes red if the blindness returns.
 *
 * ## The verdict (V), and what it is NOT
 *
 * For each (schema, key) pair a matched ASSERTION predicates, V asks one
 * mechanical question -- is `key` a member of `schema`'s member set? -- and
 * compares it with the sentence's POLARITY:
 *
 *   POSITIVE claim (`S declares K`)             contradicted when K is absent
 *   NEGATIVE claim (`S declares none of them`)  contradicted when K is present
 *
 * A contradiction is a CANDIDATE and nothing more. V does not establish that
 * the sentence predicates that key of that schema, and it cannot: English is
 * not parsed here. Above all it does NOT decide the only question that matters
 * for a repair -- whether the claim ROTTED (true when written, falsified later)
 * or was BORN FALSE (false at its own write-time ref). Those take OPPOSITE
 * repairs, and BORN FALSE can only be established at the ref where the sentence
 * was written. So nothing here licenses touching a changeset body.
 *
 * ## The limits that produce this instrument's false positives
 *
 * ⛔ This heading used to say THREE, and the count was wrong in the direction a
 * written-down cardinal always fails (#9): it was read once, against the three
 * sources known that day, and nothing re-derived it. objectui#9766's triage,
 * holding two cards at once, measured that at least two more sources sat outside
 * it -- key extraction (repaired by that card, stated below) and the corpus
 * boundary (objectui#9767). So the list is THE LIST, and is not a closed count:
 * ⛔ read nothing into its length, and add to it here when you find another.
 *
 * The first three were measured by adjudicating a sample of ten flagged entries
 * fully (objectui#9727, the readings are on that card's pull request, not copied
 * here per #9):
 *
 *   WINDOW PAIRING, REPAIRED AND ITS RESIDUE NAMED (objectui#9754). A sentence
 *   may name schema S and key K and predicate K of something else entirely -- a
 *   registry-local type, another node, a spec schema, a zod method, a CLI
 *   subcommand, a DOM tag. V paired them because they shared a SENTENCE, which
 *   is a window nothing chose: it is the cartesian product of every schema the
 *   sentence names with every key it names. This was the limit the card's own
 *   author stated first and the largest source, and it is also where the KEY
 *   EXTRACTION residue below was handed -- a lowerCamelCase word that is a
 *   function name is told apart from a member key only by the POSITION it sits
 *   in. The window is now the DECLARATION CLAUSE: a key pairs with the schemas
 *   named in the clause whose verb governs it, one pair per OCCURRENCE, and the
 *   whole rule (its four cases, and the fifth for a relative clause, which has
 *   no subject of its own and takes its antecedent's) is on `readWindow`.
 *   ⇒ A clause whose subject is not a schema symbol at all -- a registry node
 *   name, "the interface", "the type" -- now pairs its keys with NOTHING, which
 *   is the honest reading: this instrument resolves membership against a named
 *   symbol, and there is no named symbol there to resolve against.
 *   ⚠️ RESIDUE, named rather than hidden, and it is the same shape one level
 *   down: the window got smaller, it did not become a parser. A clause that
 *   BOTH declares AND names two schemas still pairs its keys with both; a schema
 *   named in a clause only as the owner of some OTHER member (`S.className`) is
 *   still that clause's schema; and a subject separated from its verb by
 *   anything but a relative or parenthetical break -- an em-dash apposition,
 *   "`k` is declared on both faces -- the interface `A` and the mirror `B`" --
 *   is now out of reach, so that pairing is DROPPED rather than made wrongly.
 *   ⛔ That last one is a false negative this repair introduces, and it is
 *   written here rather than discovered later.
 *
 *   A TABLE OF SUPERSEDED READINGS, REPAIRED AND ITS RESIDUE NAMED
 *   (objectui#9754, repaired by objectui#9870). An entry may carry a table whose
 *   first column is a reading it is RETIRING and whose later columns are what
 *   falsified it and when. The retired claim read as a present-tense assertion
 *   in ASSERTION position with its correction beside it, unread -- and
 *   quotation position does not reach it, because the retired reading is not
 *   quoted, it is TABULATED.
 *   ⛔ The entry this replaces also MISDESCRIBED the mechanism, in the direction
 *   that makes a defect look smaller than it is, and the correction is the
 *   reason the repair is where it is: it said every cell of one ROW was joined
 *   into one sentence and called that join deliberate. The join was neither
 *   bounded by a row nor deliberate -- the code doing it carried the opposite
 *   intent in its own comment (`the cells are independent fragments`). `. ` cuts
 *   a sentence only before a character that is not lower-case, and a row's last
 *   cell got no terminator at all, so an ENTIRE table collapsed into ONE
 *   sentence: header, delimiter row and every data row, with every key in it
 *   offered to every schema named anywhere in it.
 *   ⇒ The repair reads the table instead of flattening it (`segmentSentences`):
 *   a cell is its own unit of text, and a cell in a column the table's OWN
 *   HEADER retires -- the column a later one declares it was `falsified by` --
 *   takes the third POSITION, `superseded`. Counted, reported, never flagged.
 *   ⛔ Deliberately NOT done: excluding table rows from assertion position as a
 *   class, or widening quotation to cover every tabulated reading. Both are
 *   cheap against this corpus and both buy a false negative in the shape this
 *   family has already paid for once -- a table that ASSERTS is the ordinary
 *   case here, and a claim silently never judged is the failure that does not
 *   ring. ⚠️ RESIDUE: a `before | after` table retires its first column by
 *   MEANING and not by a word in its header, and is not read here; and a claim
 *   split across two columns is now two sentences and pairs with nothing --
 *   it was only ever reachable through the cross-row collapse that also paired
 *   it with every other row.
 *
 *   POLARITY BY CLAUSE (was: POLARITY BY KEYWORD -- objectui#9754 narrowed it).
 *   Polarity is a property of the clause that carries the declaration verb, not
 *   of the sentence. Reading it sentence-wide made "It has no mirror entry
 *   today, so ... `S` declares K" a NEGATIVE claim and inverted the verdict on
 *   a key the sentence asserts. The sentence is now cut at clause boundaries
 *   (`;` `:` parens, dashes, `⇒`, and the coordinators/subordinators `and`
 *   `but` `so` `which` `while` `because` ...), the negators are read only
 *   inside the clause that carries the verb, and each key takes the polarity of
 *   the DECLARATION CLAUSE IT IS WRITTEN IN. A key written outside any
 *   declaration clause inherits the nearest declaration clause before it --
 *   except that a negator-led fragment (`... and no \`data\``) keeps its own
 *   negation, which is how a coordinated "declares X and no Y" reads correctly
 *   on both halves. A key resolved across a sentence boundary (the pronoun
 *   case) has no clause of its own and takes the sentence's first declaration
 *   clause, which is the clause its verb is in.
 *
 *   ⭐ The residue this left was handed to WINDOW PAIRING above and is now
 *   closed there (objectui#9754): a sentence whose SAME key sits in two
 *   declaration clauses of opposite polarity used to resolve to the first one,
 *   because the sentence held ONE reading per key. It holds one per OCCURRENCE
 *   now, so the two claims stop overwriting each other and each is judged
 *   against the schema ITS OWN clause names -- which is what "choosing between
 *   them is the window question" meant. ⛔ Still unrepaired here: `without` and
 *   `fails to` are read as clause-wide negators.
 *
 *   THE ANNOTATION READ AS PROSE -- A POLARITY INVERSION, REPAIRED
 *   (objectui#9832). objectui#9794 made a mention written the way a face
 *   declares it (`value?: never`) read as a key for the first time, and that is
 *   what let the clause carrying it reach the polarity criterion. The criterion
 *   was a regex over PROSE and it accepts `\bnever\b` -- but a DECLARING clause
 *   can carry a TYPE ANNOTATION that is also `never`, so "the TypeScript
 *   interface `S` declares `value?: never`", an assertion that S DOES declare
 *   the key, read NEGATIVE and the verdict inverted: under the negative reading
 *   the contradiction is the schema that HAS the member. ⭐ `never` as a
 *   TypeScript type and `never` as an English adverb are INDISTINGUISHABLE to a
 *   prose regex, which is a property of this whole instrument class and not a
 *   typo in one word list. The repair is therefore POSITIONAL: the negators are
 *   now read over the clause with its backticked spans still masked (`prose` on
 *   `segmentClauses`), so a word inside a span is code and is no longer a word
 *   of the sentence. ⛔ `never` was deliberately NOT removed from the word list
 *   -- it is a real English negator and "the renderer never reads it" must keep
 *   reading negative; deleting it would have widened the hole instead of
 *   closing it. ⚠️ This spelling is ADR-0049's by-name refusal tombstone
 *   (objectui#9764), so the misreading was growing with the corpus rather than
 *   sitting still. ⚠️ RESIDUE: only the polarity read moved. The population
 *   predicate still reads the restored clause, so a declaration verb written
 *   inside a span still opens a declaration clause.
 *
 *   TOP-LEVEL MEMBERSHIP ONLY. A key declared on an INLINE nested object
 *   (`sort?: Array<{ field; direction }>`) is a member of that object, not of
 *   the schema, and a sentence naming it reads as absent. Descending would
 *   re-create the "a name is not a key" failure at one more level, so the
 *   narrow reading is deliberate and the cost is named here instead.
 *
 *   KEY EXTRACTION, REPAIRED AND ITS RESIDUE NAMED (objectui#9766). The reader
 *   used to admit backticked tokens that cannot be member keys at all -- the
 *   language's own primitives and keywords, and call expressions -- because the
 *   exclusion rule was written on only one side: a PascalCase token was named a
 *   TYPE and refused, while every lowercase token was waved through. The rule is
 *   now written on both sides, on `keyHead`, where the PascalCase half already
 *   lived. ⚠️ What it CANNOT fix is the residue, and it is lexical: a bare
 *   lowerCamelCase word naming a function, a CLI subcommand, a zod method or an
 *   error code is spelled EXACTLY like a member key, and only the position it
 *   sits in tells them apart -- which is the WINDOW PAIRING question above, not a
 *   key-extraction one. ⛔ The narrowing deliberately stops at what the tree can
 *   answer: a language word is refused only where no face declares a member by
 *   that name, so a present-tense claim about an ordinary key this tree no longer
 *   declares -- objectui#9713's `allowCollapse`, the whole point of the
 *   instrument -- is still read and still flagged.
 *
 *   THE OPTIONAL MARKER -- A FALSE NEGATIVE, REPAIRED (objectui#9794). ⭐ It sits
 *   under a heading about false POSITIVES because it sat on the same reader and
 *   pointed the other way, and because the dropped shape is the harder one to
 *   notice: a false positive gets seen and complained about, while a key mention
 *   dropped whole means that claim was never judged at all -- a zero that never
 *   rings. The annotation used to be the only decoration cut, so a mention
 *   written the way a face declares it (`allowCollapse?: boolean`) had head
 *   `allowCollapse?`, which is not an identifier, and went out entire.
 *   ⚠️ Whether that is a legitimate spelling HERE is a question about this
 *   corpus, and it was decided by measuring the corpus rather than by taste: the
 *   reading and the ref it was taken at are on objectui#9794's pull request,
 *   ⛔ not copied here (#9), and re-derivable with the probe that card names --
 *   a backticked span whose head, cut at `:`, ends in `?`. ⚠️ RESIDUE: a mention
 *   carrying any OTHER syntax is still dropped, by rule 1 and on purpose, and
 *   that is a false negative this instrument keeps.
 *
 *   THE MEMBER INDEX'S OWN BOUNDARY, REPORTED ON ITS OWN LINE (objectui#9767).
 *   The index is built over ONE tree (`--types`, `packages/types/src` by
 *   default), so a sentence may name a schema that is perfectly alive and still
 *   get no face here -- it is declared in a DECLARED DEPENDENCY this tree
 *   re-exports from, or in this repo outside the indexed tree. That is the
 *   instrument's own reach, ⛔ not a defect in the sentence. Until this card the
 *   verdict reported it under one heading with the sentence naming a schema that
 *   is GONE -- one of those two is a candidate and the other is not, and a
 *   reader could not tell which row was which. ⇒ The bucket is now SPLIT and
 *   each half is named: the symbol either RESOLVES outside the index (where it
 *   resolved is reported with it) or it resolves NOWHERE this run can reach.
 *   ⚠️ The split has its OWN controls, because its failure mode is the loud kind
 *   wearing quiet clothes: a resolution root that cannot be read declares
 *   nothing, every symbol it holds falls to the second line, and the report
 *   claims a pile of live schemas are gone. So every root the owning
 *   `package.json` declares must be readable AND yield declarations, or the run
 *   exits 2 and its numbers are void. ⚠️ RESIDUE: resolution is by NAME. The
 *   probe answers "a symbol spelled this way is declared out there", ⛔ never
 *   "it is the schema the sentence means" -- that is the WINDOW PAIRING question
 *   again. And a schema that is gone from the index but still declared in a
 *   stale published dependency reads as resolved, which is the honest reading of
 *   a tree whose dependency still ships it. ⛔ Per #9 no reading is written here:
 *   the split's membership, and the ref it was taken at, are on this card's pull
 *   request and are re-derivable by running the census.
 *
 * ⛔ None of them is a reason to stop reporting a flag. They are the reason
 * a flag is a CANDIDATE: every one of them is resolved by a human reading the
 * sentence, and none is resolvable by reading the count.
 *
 * ## Controls -- run on the SAME corpus as the census, on every run
 *
 * A zero counts only against a LIT control on the same instrument. Two zeros on
 * one instrument means the instrument is broken, not that the tree is clean.
 * The lit and absent controls are asserted on every run and reported with the
 * count; if either fails the run exits 2 and its numbers are void. The
 * RESOLUTION pair (objectui#9767) is asserted the same way and for the same
 * reason: it reads the roots the split is decided on, so an unreadable root
 * voids the run instead of silently moving live schemas onto the gone line.
 *
 * ## It does not answer about itself
 *
 * The corpus is `.changeset/` and nothing else. This file's own prose names
 * schemas and declaration verbs in every paragraph above, and the test fixtures
 * carry the very sentences the pins are about -- a probe that scanned the tree
 * at large would match its own docstring and its own fixtures and report itself.
 * The corpus boundary is pinned by the test.

 * Cut a changeset body into paragraphs, then into sentences, recording the

 * eighty columns reads as ONE sentence.
 *
 * ## A TABLE IS NOT WRAPPED PROSE (objectui#9870)
 *
 * A table row used to be stripped of its pipes and then joined into the
 * paragraph like any other continuation line, with `. ` standing in for the
 * cell boundary. That spelling MEANT what the rule above still means -- the
 * cells are independent fragments -- and it did not achieve it in either
 * direction, which is why it is gone:
 *
 *   - `. ` only cuts a sentence where the next cell opens with a character that
 *     is not lower-case (`cutSentences`), and this corpus's later columns open
 *     with `objectui#...` more often than not. So the cells of one row stayed
 *     ONE sentence.
 *   - a row's LAST cell got no terminator at all, so nothing separated one row
 *     from the next. An entire table -- header, delimiter row and every row --
 *     collapsed into a single sentence, and every key in it was offered to every
 *     schema named anywhere in the table. That is the cartesian window
 *     objectui#9754 closed at the sentence level, rebuilt one level up.
 *
 * Table structure is therefore READ rather than flattened: a cell is a unit of
 * text and is cut into sentences on its own, the delimiter row is dropped as
 * syntax, and the header row is kept -- it is what lets a column be read as a
 * position rather than as prose.
 *
 * ⇒ POSITION gains its third value, `superseded`: a cell in a column the
 * table's own header retires (`supersededColumns`) is a reading this entry is
 * RETIRING, not a claim about today's tree. It is counted, reported, and never
 * flagged -- the same standing `quoted` has, under its own name because the
 * reason is different. Quotation does not reach these: the retired reading is
 * not quoted, it is tabulated.
 *
 * ⛔ What this does NOT do: judge a table by its shape. A table that asserts is
 * still read and still flagged, which is the false negative directions that
 * excluded table rows wholesale would have bought. ⚠️ RESIDUE, named rather
 * than discovered later: a `before | after` table is the same defect wearing a
 * different header and is NOT read here -- its first column is retired by the
 * table's meaning and not by its header's words. And a claim whose subject sits
 * in one column and whose verb sits in another is now two sentences and pairs
 * with nothing; it was reachable only by the cross-row collapse above, which
 * paired it with every other row as well.

 *
 *   `byKey`        -- the polarity of the clause each key is written in
 *                     (objectui#9754 slice 1).
 *   `schemasByKey` -- THE WINDOW A PAIRING MAY BE MADE ACROSS, below.
 *
 * `polarity` is the sentence-level reading (the first declaration clause), kept
 * because a key resolved across a sentence boundary has no clause here; the
 * same fallback gives those keys their schemas, in `crossSentenceSchemas`.
 *
 * ## THE WINDOW (objectui#9754). The sentence is the wrong one.
 *
 * V used to pair every schema the SENTENCE names with every key the sentence
 * names -- a cartesian product over a window nothing chose. The instrument
 * named the cost on itself: a sentence may name schema S and key K and
 * predicate K of something else entirely, and V pairs them because they share a
 * sentence. The pairing a declaration actually makes is between the SUBJECT of
 * the declaration verb and the keys THAT VERB governs, and both of those live
 * in one clause -- the same scope slice 1 already established for polarity.
 *
 * So the window is the DECLARATION CLAUSE, and a key's governing clause is:
 *
 *   1. the clause the key is written in, when that clause declares;
 *   2. else the clause IMMEDIATELY before it, when that one declares -- which is
 *      the coordinated object list, "`S` declares `a` and no `b`";
 *   3. else, when NO declaration clause precedes the key anywhere in the
 *      sentence, the sentence's first declaration clause -- a key written ahead
 *      of the verb has no earlier clause to inherit from, and this is the same
 *      fallback the cross-sentence pronoun already takes;
 *   4. else NONE. A declaration clause does precede the key, but another
 *      predication was opened between them, and reaching back across it is
 *      exactly the pairing this repair refuses.
 *
 * The key then pairs with the schemas named IN THAT CLAUSE, and with no others.
 * ⇒ A clause whose subject is not a schema symbol at all -- a registry node
 * name, "the interface", "the type" -- pairs its keys with NOTHING rather than
 * with whatever schema the rest of the sentence happens to mention.
 *
 * ⚠️ What this is NOT, and the limit is the honest half: it does not read
 * English. A clause that both declares and names two schemas still pairs its
 * keys with both, and a schema named in a clause only as the owner of some
 * OTHER member (`S.className`) is still that clause's schema. The window got
 * smaller; it did not become a parser. Residues are named under "The limits
 * that produce this instrument's false positives".
 *
 * ⭐ THE NEGATORS ARE READ OVER `prose`, NEVER OVER `text` (objectui#9832). A
 * backticked span is CODE, and a word inside it is not a word of the sentence:
 * `never` is a TypeScript type as often as it is an English adverb, and on a
 * prose regex the two are INDISTINGUISHABLE. Reading the restored clause made
 * "the interface `S` declares `value?: never`" -- an assertion that S DOES
 * declare the key -- a NEGATIVE claim, which inverts the verdict: under the
 * negative reading the schema "in contradiction" is the one that HAS the
 * member, exactly backwards. ⚠️ The repair is positional and NOT lexical:
 * `never` stays in `NEGATIVE` because it is a real English negator and
 * "the renderer never reads it" must keep reading negative. Deleting the word
 * would have bought this fixture's green by widening the hole instead.
 * ⚠️ RESIDUE, named rather than hidden: the same span-blindness argument
 * applies to `PRESENT_DECLARATION` and to `LEADING_NEGATOR` at the head of a
 * clause, and only the first of those is left reading `text` here -- a clause
 * whose ONLY declaration verb sits inside a span still counts as a declaration
 * clause. That is a population question, not a polarity one, and narrowing it
 * belongs to whichever card measures it.

/**
 * WHAT A MEMBER KEY LOOKS LIKE IN THIS PROTOCOL -- both halves, in one place
 * (objectui#9766). The PascalCase half used to live here alone, and stopping
 * there is what let `string`, `extends` and `retirementTombstone()` through.
 *
 * A member key is a NAME, and the backticked span has to BE that name:
 *
 *   1. THE SPAN IS THE NAME, SPELLED THE WAY A DECLARATION SPELLS IT. A key is
 *      written bare (`columns`), carrying its type annotation
 *      (`columns: KanbanColumn[]`), carrying the optional marker a declaration
 *      puts on it (`view?`), or carrying both (`allowCollapse?: boolean`) --
 *      all four NAME the key, and the annotation and the marker are the two
 *      decorations, which is the whole of that list (objectui#9794).
 *      Everything else in a backticked span is a fragment of CODE, not a name:
 *      a call (`retirementTombstone()`, `handlerKeyRefusal(..., 'runtime-slot')`),
 *      a heritage clause (`extends Omit<Partial<X>, ...>`), a statement
 *      (`export { A as B }`), an operator use (`as any`), a switch label
 *      (`case 'map'`). The reader used to CUT the span at its first separator,
 *      which manufactured a name out of any of those -- that construction is
 *      gone, and only those two decorations are still cut.
 *      ⚠️ The marker is cut only where it TRAILS the head, the one position a
 *      declaration writes it in: in `props?.foo` the `?` is optional chaining
 *      and the span stays refused as the code fragment it is.
 *
 *   2. THE NAME IS SPELLED LIKE A KEY. One regex, `MEMBER_KEY_SPELLING`, so the
 *      correct shape is the only spelling that gets through. A backticked
 *      PascalCase token is a TYPE name (`ObjectGridComponentProps`,
 *      `GanttConfig`), and reading one as a key is the shape that inflated the
 *      transcribed count.
 *
 *   3. THE NAME IS THIS PROTOCOL'S, NOT THE LANGUAGE'S. `string` and `size` are
 *      lexically identical, so no character-class rule can separate them and
 *      this half is deliberately NOT lexical. A word the TypeScript compiler
 *      defines as a keyword is the language the faces are written in, not a key
 *      of the protocol they describe -- so it is admitted only where the tree
 *      being read declares a member by that name. `type` is a key (the protocol's
 *      own recursion point, and this instrument's member control); `string`,
 *      `number`, `boolean`, `any` are keys of nothing and stop being read as keys.
 *      ⛔ The gate applies to LANGUAGE WORDS ONLY, and that limit is load bearing:
 *      applied to every name it would suppress exactly the claim this instrument
 *      exists to catch -- a present-tense claim about a key the tree no longer
 *      declares anywhere, which is objectui#9713's `allowCollapse`.
 *
 * ONE spelling, because polarity has to locate the same heads `backtickedKeys`
 * returns: two readings of what counts as a key would silently disagree and the
 * per-key polarity would land on a key the verdict never asks about. `declared`
 * therefore travels with the text through `readClaim` -> `backtickedKeys` /
 * `readPolarity`; OMITTING it is the strict reading (no language word is a key),
 * never a wider one, so a caller that forgets it loses keys rather than inventing
 * them. `census` always passes the set built from the member index it was handed.
 *
