 * What this widget's column producer is allowed to EMIT (objectui#6373).
 *
 * `enrich` below hands its result to `data-table`, whose columns slot is
 * `DataTableSchema.columns: TableColumn[]`. It used to return
 * `NormalizedColumn`, whose `[key: string]: any` accepts anything, so nothing
 * checked the emit against the slot's declaration at all: `{ ...col,
 * ...fieldMeta }` wrote SEVEN keys `TableColumn` does not declare — `name`,
 * `label`, `options`, `referenceTo`, `format`, `currency`, `decimals`.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Why this is not just `: TableColumn`
 *
 * Measured on this program before choosing the shape: annotating the return
 * `TableColumn` and leaving the spread in place raises NO error. TypeScript's
 * excess-property check is a FRESHNESS check on the properties an object
 * literal WRITES OUT; properties arriving through a spread are exempt. So the
 * plain annotation the card suggested is blind to the exact defect the card is
 * about — it would have type-checked the seam without enforcing it, converting
 * a surfaced-key census into a silenced one.
 *
 * The `?: never` members are what make the annotation able to fail. They are
 * ADR-0049 retirement tombstones — this repo's convention for a key that is
 * refused rather than merely absent (`StaticTableColumn` in
 * `@object-ui/types`, `crud.ts` `confirm`) — and they bite by ASSIGNABILITY,
 * not freshness: `FieldMeta['label']` is `string`, which is not assignable to
 * `undefined`, so re-introducing `{ ...fieldMeta }` here is a compile error
 * (TS2322) naming the first offending key. Writing one out explicitly is the
 * other error (TS2353). Both directions were run before this type was written.
 *
 * ## The rule, so the next producer gets the same answer
 *
 * A producer may write into a `TableColumn[]` slot only keys the CONSUMER of
 * that slot reads, and the consumer's read set is MEASURED from the consumer's
 * source, never assumed. Then: a key the consumer reads and `TableColumn`
 * declares is written; a key the consumer reads and `TableColumn` does not
 * declare is held as an alias only where a ruling already holds it; a key the
 * consumer does not read is RETIRED from the emit — never declared, because
 * declaring a key nothing reads is the same `declared != enforced` defect
 * facing the other way (objectui#5453's forwarded `wrap` key).
 *
 * Measured read set of the consumer (`data-table.tsx`, comments stripped):
 * `accessorKey`, `width`, `align`, `header`, `className`, `cellClassName`,
 * `sortable`, `resizable`, `editable`, `type`, `cell`, `headerIcon`,
 * `fitContent`, and `name`. Not one of `label`, `options`, `referenceTo`,
 * `format`, `currency`, `decimals` appears — so all six retired from the
 * emit, and this producer still SOURCES none of them from `fieldMeta`.
 *
 * ⚠️ Three of the six — `format`, `options`, `currency` — have since been
 * DECLARED on `TableColumn` itself (objectui#6425, maintainer ruling
 * 2026-08-27), so they are no longer tombstoned on this emit type: the band
 * below derives them away the moment the declaration landed. That is not a
 * softening of the emit rule but its other branch — an AUTHORED value now
 * passes through `{ ...col }` as declared metadata (the cell pipeline reads
 * it back off the authored column), while writing one out of `fieldMeta`
 * remains retired, pinned by the runtime census in
 * `ObjectDataTable.emitBoundary-6373.test.tsx`.
 *
 * Retiring them is behaviour-preserving because none of them was the live path
 * for its own value: everything they carried is read off `fieldMeta` by the
 * `cell` closure below, which is where this widget's type-aware rendering
 * actually happens. That check — does the value still reach its consumer by
 * another road? — is part of the rule, not an aside: a key with no second road
 * is not inert, and retiring it would change behaviour.
 *
 * `type` is not adjudicated here. objectui#5853 already settled it at this
 * seam, and its fold (`normalizeTableColumnType`) stands unchanged.
 *
 * `name` is HELD, not retired, and not adjudicated here either: it is
 * objectui#5120's, still open. `data-table` reads `col.accessorKey || col.name`
 * and holds that alias deliberately, because two PUBLISHED skill guides teach a
 * `data-table` column spelled `{ name, label }`. So this producer keeps writing
 * it, byte for byte what it wrote before, and the hold is now DECLARED at the
 * seam instead of arriving anonymously inside a spread. When #5120 retires the
 * consumer alias, this member becomes a tombstone with it.

 * ⭐ `decimals` — RETIRED from `FieldMeta` ITSELF (objectui#6625), and this
 * hand-written tombstone is now the ONLY enforcement of that key's refusal at
 * BOTH halves of this seam. ⛔ Do not "tidy" it away as redundant.
 *
 * Until objectui#6625 the key needed no tombstone: it was a `FieldMeta` member,
 * so BOTH bands below — {@link EnrichedColumn}'s write-side tombstones
 * (objectui#6373) and {@link UnheldFieldMetaOverrideKey}'s read-side refusal
 * (objectui#6425) — derived it for free. Refusal by MEMBERSHIP. #6625 then
 * retired the member (written from the schema def, read by nothing), which
 * removed it from `keyof FieldMeta` and silently ended that enforcement at both
 * ends. Nothing would have gone red at the moment of loss: on the read side the
 * suite's `@ts-expect-error` would merely have turned TS2578-unused, and on the
 * write side the hand-written pin would have gone on passing on the
 * excess-property check alone — a pin passing because its subject stopped

 *
 * This is the exact mirror of the rule `ObjectGrid`'s sibling tombstone
 * records (`ObjectGridRetiredOptionsTombstone`, objectui#6425): *a pin enforced
 * by a key's non-membership silently stops enforcing the moment the key becomes
 * a member.* Read from this end: **a refusal DERIVED from a key's membership
 * silently stops enforcing the moment that member is deleted.** Same seam, same
 * blindness, opposite direction — which is why the retirement had to be
 * re-stated by hand rather than inherited.
 *
 * objectui#6425's verdict is unchanged — no reader for an authored `decimals`
 * existed then and none exists now — and so is the runtime behaviour: the value
 * the retired `buildFieldMeta` write resolved reached nothing. Only the
 * refusal's mechanism moves, from derived to hand-written. It is intersected
 * into BOTH types below, because the retirement belongs to the SEAM, not to one
 * of its two halves — the same reason `ObjectGrid` intersects its own tombstone
 * into both its draft and its post-fold column. ⭐ A future reader for decimal

 *
 * The verdict: `referenceTo` was documented by this package's README as an

 * {@link EnrichedColumn} above fences on the WRITE side. objectui#6373 fenced
 * what `enrich` emits; nothing yet fenced what it consumes.
 *
 * `enrich` handed `buildFieldMeta` six values taken off the authored column.
 * Five of them — `format`, `options`, `referenceTo`, `currency`, `decimals` —
 * were declared by neither `TableColumn` (`@object-ui/types`) nor its

 * answers `any` just as loudly without the tell. So the widget honoured an
 * authoring vocabulary the published types refuse, and no artefact in the repo
 * said which keys those were or why.
 *
 * ## The per-key ruling landed (objectui#6425, maintainer 2026-08-27)
 *
 * This type used to hold all five keys with ⛔ "declares nothing and retires
 * nothing" — both branches were maintainer decisions. The ruling has since
 * disposed of them per key, and this keyhole now CARRIES that disposition:
 *
 *  - `format`, `options` — DECLARED on `TableColumn` + its zod mirror
 *    (documented AND kept; declaring is truth-maintenance). Read below at
 *    their published types via `Pick<TableColumn, …>`.
 *  - `currency` — DECLARED (kept in production, never promised before;
 *    declaring makes the existing behaviour honest). Same `Pick`.
 *  - `decimals` — RETIRED, immediately (neither promised nor kept: zero
 *    readers measured, and the authored read below is gone). Refused by
 *    {@link ObjectDataTableRetiredDecimalsTombstone} since objectui#6625
 *    retired the `FieldMeta` member itself and took the key out of the derived
 *    band's pool; the verdict is unchanged, only its mechanism moved.
 *  - `referenceTo` — RETIRED (objectui#6597, enforce-or-remove: measured no
 *    authoring story for a column-level reference override — see the
 *    withdraw verdict above `ObjectDataTableRetiredReferenceToTombstone`).
 *    Refused by that tombstone the same way `decimals` is refused by its own.
 *
 * The shape itself is unchanged from what objectui#6461 landed for
 * `plugin-grid` (`ObjectGridColumnHolds` / `RetiredListColumnKey`); the
 * identifiers differ because this producer's seam is a READ, not an emit.
 *
 * ## The band is DERIVED, and it bites by assignability
 *
 * `FieldMeta` is the override vocabulary — `buildFieldMeta`'s `overrides` is a
 * subset of it — so it is the pool a new tolerance would come from, and the
 * same pool {@link EnrichedColumn}'s tombstones derive from. Deriving means a
 * NEW `FieldMeta` member is refused here on the day it is added, without
 * anyone remembering to extend a hand-written list. (Stated without a count on
 * purpose: it read "a seventh" while the type had eight members, and
 * objectui#6625 and objectui#6597 have since retired two. The property is
 * that ADDING is covered by derivation — ⚠️ REMOVING is not, which is why
 * those cards each had to leave a hand-written tombstone behind —
 * {@link ObjectDataTableRetiredDecimalsTombstone} and
 * {@link ObjectDataTableRetiredReferenceToTombstone}.)
 *
 * ⚠️ It derives from the OVERRIDE VOCABULARY, not from the authored input
 * type, and that difference is forced rather than stylistic. `plugin-grid`'s
 * sibling band (`RetiredListColumnKey`, objectui#6461) is
 * `Exclude<keyof ListColumn, …>` — it can derive from its authored type
 * because `ListColumn` DECLARES its keys. This producer's authored type
 * cannot: {@link NormalizedColumn} carries `[key: string]: any`, so `keyof` it
 * is `string | number`. Measured on this program — a band built on it accepts
 * `'totallyMadeUpKey'` as a member, so it would ban nothing at all. The pool
 * therefore has to be the vocabulary the overrides are drawn FROM.
 *
 * That choice has a cost, and it is stated here rather than left to be
 * discovered: a candidate key OUTSIDE `FieldMeta` can never land in the band.
 * It is refused by the other half of this type instead —
 * `AuthoredColumnOverrides` declares no index signature, so reading an
 * unadjudicated key is TS2339 AT THE READ SITE, which is the enforcement
 * `enrich` actually runs on (`(col as any).x` and the bag's index signature
 * both answered `any` there). Both halves are pinned by the suite.
 *
 * ⚠️ Measured on this program, in both directions, before this shape was
 * written:
 *  - `?: never` bites by ASSIGNABILITY, not by freshness, so the refusal
 *    survives a spread — `const s: AuthoredColumnOverrides = someBag` fails on
 *    a source that DECLARES a banded key, and passes on one that does not.
 *  - `accessorKey` is required here for a reason that is not decoration:
 *    without one property in common, TypeScript's weak-type check rejects the
 *    assignment below outright (TS2559), and a type that refuses everything
 *    pins nothing. It is the same key {@link NormalizedColumn} already
 *    declares required, so this makes no new claim about the authored object.
 *
 * ## A VIEW, not a census of the object
 *
 * The banded members say "this producer must not SOURCE this override from the
 * authored column" — not "this key is absent at run time". `normalizeColumns`
 * deliberately leaves the authored spelling in place, so a column really can
 * carry `name` / `label`; they are refused HERE because this seam already has
 * answers for both and they do not come from the column: `name` comes from
 * `accessorKey` and `label` from `col.header`, which objectui#5351 made the one
 * place the authored label is translated.

 * a relation. Neither the type family nor the test itself is restated here:
 * this delegates to {@link isLookupType} in `recordFields.tsx`, the package's
 * single relation predicate, which reads `EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES` — the family
 * `@object-ui/core` publishes. Used
 * by the dashboard table widget to ask the data adapter to populate referenced
 * records (e.g. `account: { id, name }`) so cells don't show raw FK ids.
 *
 * THE GATE (objectui#4914, ruling B) runs ahead of the relation test. Measured
 * before the ruling: a `record_owner: { type: 'owner' }` column was ACTIVELY
 * requested for `$expand` — the retired spelling got the full relational read
 * path while the same field's editor answered with a tombstone. It is refused
 * now, loudly and once, and the cell shows the raw id it was always going to
 * show once the spelling stopped being a relation. That the author is TOLD is
 * the whole difference between this and the mechanical deletion the
 * measurement rejected.
 *
 * ## The relation test is core's object, not a private copy (objectui#5692)
 *
 * It used to be the inline literal
 * `t === 'lookup' || t === 'reference' || t === 'master_detail' || t === 'user'`
 * — one of TWO copies this package held (the other `LOOKUP_TYPES` in
 * `recordFields.tsx`), neither deriving from nor pinned against the family core
 * publishes. objectui#5312's claim to have converted "the LAST private copy"
 * was false by these two; they predate that sweep and were outside its file
 * surface.
 *
 * This is the LIVE half of that convergence — `computeLookupExpand` drives a
 * real `$expand` on every dashboard table fetch — so both membership deltas are
 * observable here, and both were decided by measurement (see `isLookupType` in
 * `recordFields.tsx` for the full record):
 *
 *  - a `tree` column now GETS `$expand`-ed, the same treatment the form / grid
 *    road already gives it;
 *  - a `reference` column no longer does, and that is a no-op on spec-compliant
 *    data: the spelling is absent from `@objectstack/spec`'s closed `FieldType`
 *    and refused by `FieldSchema.safeParse`, so no object schema can declare a
 *    field whose stored type is `reference`.
 *
 * ## One predicate, not two that agree by coincidence (objectui#5876)
 *
 * This function used to carry its own `isLookup`, byte-identical to
 * `isLookupType` once objectui#5692 had pointed both at the same set — two
 * bodies that agreed because one sweep aligned them, with nothing keeping them
 * aligned afterwards. The test IS `isLookupType` now, so this module no longer
 * IMPORTS the shared family or the retirement gate and no longer CALLS either
 * (they are named in this prose and nowhere else in the file). That absence is
 * the assertion: a BEHAVIOURAL test cannot see this change, because a
 * byte-identical local copy satisfies every boolean claim you can make about
 * `$expand`. The pin that can see it is the identity pin in
 * `__tests__/expandableFamily.identity-5692.test.ts`.
