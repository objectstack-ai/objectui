/**
 * Registry mapping component types to their schema definitions.
 *
 * Two halves with different standing, split deliberately (objectui#7665),
 * because one of them is reachable from this package and the other is not:
 *
 * **The KEY SET is the Single Source of Truth for component type lookups.**
 * `keyof SchemaRegistry` IS the published `ComponentType` union (declared at the
 * end of this file), so whether a key is declared here is the whole answer to
 * whether a component type is registered — and a consumer discriminating on
 * `ComponentType` is entitled to that answer.
 *
 * **A VALUE is the strongest type THIS LAYER can reach for that key**, which for
 * a component whose renderer lives in a plugin package may be NARROWER than the
 * type that renderer honours. Structural, not an oversight: such a component's
 * authoring face is declared in the plugin, and this package cannot name it —
 *
 *   - `pnpm check:phantom-deps` (`scripts/check-phantom-dependencies.mjs`)
 *     judges `import type` exactly as it judges a value import, so importing a
 *     specifier `@object-ui/types` does not declare is refused; and
 *   - declaring the dependency instead closes a cycle — a plugin package depends
 *     on this one, directly or through what it depends on — and the build graph
 *     is then rejected as cyclic.
 *
 *   Both are re-derived by those two tools; this paragraph is not the evidence.
 *
 * ⇒ The limit is this layer's reach, ⛔ not a licence for an entry to describe a
 * type it cannot name: an entry states what it can prove from here, and closing
 * the gap is a move in the plugin, not a wider claim here (objectui#7664 closed
 * the kanban one by moving the dialect down into this package).
 *
 * Worked example: objectui#7645, where the type the registered kanban renderer
 * honoured lived in `@object-ui/plugin-kanban` — unreachable from here for both
 * reasons above, while the entry described it anyway.

  // ⭐ `'page'` is the ONLY page key in this map, and the four page KINDS that
  // `ComponentRegistry` also answers — `record` / `home` / `app` / `utility` —
  // are ABSENT from it deliberately. Read that gap here before concluding
  // anything from it (objectui#9642, and objectui#9263 / objectui#9576, the two
  // cards that concluded the opposite).
  //
  // **The channel.** A STORED page document's `type` field is not a node type at
  // all: it is the spec's page KIND, enumerated by `PageTypeSchema` in
  // `@objectstack/spec/ui`. `PageView` (`@object-ui/app-shell`) hands the
  // document to `SchemaRenderer` with that kind written VERBATIM into `type` —
  // the discriminator `ComponentRegistry` dispatches on — plus a copy on
  // `pageType`. ⇒ The `PageRenderer` registrations in
  // `@object-ui/components`' `renderers/layout/page.tsx` exist BECAUSE of that
  // line; they are the renderer half of `PageTypeSchema`, which is why one of
  // them is labelled "App Page". `'page'` itself is the fallback the same
  // mapping writes for a document carrying no `type`, and it is the key
  // `PageNodeSchema` pins (`z.literal('page')`).
  //
  // ⛔ So a `PageRenderer` key missing from this map is NOT the
  // "registered but never declared" defect this repository files elsewhere: it
  // is declared, upstream, in a different vocabulary. Removing such a
  // registration stops every stored page of that kind rendering — objectui#9263
  // reached a draft PR doing exactly that and was re-ruled letter E, "⛔ not a
  // defect".
  //
  // ⭐ **`app` is one token carrying two vocabularies.** `AppComponentSchema`
  // (`./app.ts`) declares the type literal `'app'` for the APP-LEVEL DOCUMENT
  // (`app.json`: tabs, navigation, areas), which the runner / layout path reads
  // STRUCTURALLY and never resolves through `ComponentRegistry` — which is why
  // this map has no `'app'` key for it either. The spec page kind `app` is a
  // different vocabulary: a stored PAGE document with regions, served by
  // `PageRenderer` through `PageView`'s passthrough. ⛔ Neither is a collision
  // to be resolved by removing the other.
  //
  // ⚠️ Adding the kinds to this map is ⛔ NOT the remedy — `keyof SchemaRegistry`
  // IS the published `ComponentType` union, so an entry here is a widening, and
  // a widening is a ruling (the `'kanban'` note below states the same limit).
  // The live answer to which kind is served how is re-derived by
  // `page-kind-node-type-channel-9642` in `@object-ui/components`, ⛔ not by this

  // ⛔ `'kanban'` RETIRED (objectui#8802, maintainer ruling 2026-09-09). The
  // bare node type key published two faces with opposite verdicts — the plugin's
  // registry `inputs` accepted `titleField`, the Zod arm refused it by name — and
  // the maintainer dissolved the divergence by retiring the key rather than
  // patching either face. `KanbanSchema` retired with it (`complex.ts`).
  //
  // ⇒ `ComponentType` (`keyof SchemaRegistry`) no longer offers `'kanban'`, which
  // is the compile-time half of the refusal; the Zod half is
  // `RetiredKanbanNodeSchema` in `zod/complex.zod.ts`, which names `object-kanban`
  // as the remedy. The surviving spelling `'object-kanban'` is declared by
  // `ObjectKanbanSchema` (`objectql.ts`) and reached through
  // `ObjectQLComponentSchema`, and the STORED `NamedListView.type` value of the
  // same spelling is a different layer and untouched.
  //
  // ⚠️ Measured, and reported rather than fixed here: this map has NEVER had an
  // `'object-kanban'` entry, so with `'kanban'` gone the kanban family has no
  // entry in it at all. That is the objectui#7665 sweep's territory (this map's
  // coverage), not this retirement's — adding one would be a widening of

  // `'chatbot-enhanced'` and `'chatbot-floating'` are the other two keys

  // They were absent from this map until objectui#7704, so `ComponentType`
  // — the published `keyof SchemaRegistry` union — told a consumer
  // discriminating on it that two registered keys do not exist, and
  // `packages/cli/src/utils/known-schema-types.ts` had to keep its own
  // parallel list (`:83-84`) to know they do.
  //
  // Why they can be added now, and could not before: this map's value has to
  // be the type the registered renderer honours, and until objectui#7655
  // there was no honest one to point at. `ChatbotSchema` pins `type` to
  // `'chatbot'`, and the two registrations' real key sets lived in anonymous
  // `ChatbotSchema & { ... }` intersections local to the renderer file,
  // referenceable by nothing outside it. objectui#7655 gave each registration
  // one named authoring face, declared HERE — so both entries are honest (each
  // value pins `type` to its own key) AND reachable (this is a
  // zero-workspace-dependency layer; both faces are its own declarations, not
  // a plugin's). That is what separated this from the `kanban` case
  // objectui#7645 measured, where the honoured type lived in
  // `@object-ui/plugin-kanban` and naming it from here would have been a
  // phantom dependency and a cycle — resolved the other way, by moving the
  // dialect down here (objectui#7664, the `'kanban'` note above).
  //
  // The two registrations already take these exact types as their `schema`
  // parameter (`renderer.tsx:256`, `:394`), so the map's value and the
  // renderer's prop type are one declaration, the same property the `'kanban'`
  // arm above has.
  //
  // Pinned in `src/__tests__/schema-registry-chatbot-keys-7704.test.ts`: the
  // keys survive in `keyof`, each value IS the face its renderer honours, and
  // each value's `type` literal IS its own key. Scope note — objectui#7704 is
  // these two keys, whose faces now exist; it is NOT a sweep of the map's
  // other entries, which objectui#7665 holds.
