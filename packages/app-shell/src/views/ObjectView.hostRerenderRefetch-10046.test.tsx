/**
 * objectui#10046 — the object page re-issued the identical list query on
 * every re-render that changed nothing.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `renderListView` rebuilt `fullSchema.options` as a fresh object literal on
 * every call, and `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView` calls it on every one of its own
 * renders. `ListView` names `schema.options` BY IDENTITY in its fetch effect's
 * dependency list — objectui#4567 ruled that dependency correct and put the
 * stabilisation at the PRODUCER, so `plugin-list` is not touched here — and so
 * every host re-render re-ran the effect into a byte-identical
 * `dataSource.find`. Measured through the real host (this file's harness,
 * before the fix): one extra at mount (the record-count probe landing re-renders
 * the page), two on opening a record (`?recordId=`), two on closing it, one on
 * a bare parent re-render.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Not "per view switch"
 *
 * The card measured the shape in a probe host and framed it as a view switch.
 * In THIS host a view switch cannot show it: the `ListView` `key` carries the
 * active view's id, so a switch REMOUNTS the list and the one query it issues
 * is its mount fetch. The view-switch case below is therefore a CONTROL, green
 * in both worlds — it holds the switch at exactly one query each way.
 *
 * ## Why everything here is real
 *
 * The page, `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView` and `plugin-list`'s `ListView` all
 * render for real, and the host re-render is FORCED (a route change, a parent
 * state bump). A pin that stubs `ListView` or never re-renders the host passes
 * identically on the defect and on the fix.
 *
 * ## Direction, written before the reverse run
 *
 * Reverting the producer fix is predicted to turn the three FIX cases RED
 * (mount 2 list queries, record open+close 4, bare re-render 1, each where 1,
 * 0, 0 are asserted) and to leave the two CONTROLS green.
 *
 * ⚠️ The first reverse run measured 4 red / 1 green: the real-change control
 * then asserted EXACTLY one refetch, and swapping the object definition also
 * re-renders the page, which in the old world re-issued the query again (2).
 * An exact count there was a FIX limb filed as a control. The control's job is
 * the other direction — a real change must never LOSE its refetch — so it now
 * asserts at least one, which holds in both worlds. The prediction above is
 * left as written before the run.
