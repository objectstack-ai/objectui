/**
 * date-display - the ONE date/datetime display path behind every field cell,
 * grid card, gantt tooltip and dataset measure in the console.
 *
 * These functions are unchanged; what changed is where they live. They were
 * written in `@object-ui/fields`' barrel (`packages/fields/src/index.tsx`),
 * which is a React package, so `@object-ui/core` could not reach them - and
 * `core`'s `utils/dataset-format.ts` is exactly the caller that needed them:
 * `formatMeasure` returned `String(v)` for any non-numeric value, so a `min` /
 * `max` measure over a date field rendered its raw 24-character ISO string on
 * the metric tile, in chart values, in dataset table cells and in the
 * metadata-admin dataset preview (objectui#7178).
 *
 * The fix is the move, NOT a second formatter here. That choice is the whole
 * point, and it is the lesson of objectui#4576: when the percent convention
 * was duplicated across this same package boundary, a list cell and a
 * dashboard measure drifted apart (`1.234,5 %` beside `1.234,5%` in a German
 * session) while both were "correct". `dataset-format.ts`'s own header records
 * that history, and `number-display.ts` next door is the same remedy applied
 * to numbers: the pure function moves DOWN into the React-free engine and the
 * upper package re-exports it, so there is one home and nothing to drift.
 *
 * `@object-ui/fields` re-exports every symbol below under its original name,
 * so `formatDate` / `formatDateTime` / `formatDateTimeCompactParts` /
 * `formatRelativeDate` / `DateDisplayOptions` keep working unchanged for
 * `ObjectGrid`, `ObjectGantt`, `plugin-dashboard`'s `recordFields` and the
 * `date` cell renderer.
 *
 * The `datetime` CELL face joined this file in objectui#7443. It used to be a
 * second convention inlined in `DateTimeCellRenderer`: two `Intl` option bags
 * for one field type, kept in step by nothing, while `date` had exactly one.
 * It is `formatDateTime`'s `'compact'` style now, byte-identical to what the
 * cell rendered before.
 *
 * Pure by construction (no React, no i18n): the only ambient inputs are `Intl`
 * and the clock, and the one phrase `Intl` cannot produce ("Overdue Nd") comes
 * in through the INJECTED `options.t`, the same way `buildDatasetFieldHelpers`
 * in `dataset-format.ts` takes `fieldLabel`.
 *
 * ⚠️ There is a third ambient input, and it is the one this module has to
 * decide about rather than pass on: the VIEWER's timezone. A value carrying a
 * time is an instant and renders in that zone; a DATE-ONLY value names a
 * calendar day, carries no instant, and must render as that day everywhere.
 * `toDisplayDate` below is the single parse step that tells the two apart —
 * every function here goes through it (objectui#10110).

 * The ONE `value -> Date` step behind every function below.
 *
 * ## The defect (objectui#10110)
 *
 * ECMAScript parses the two ISO shapes into two different zones: a DATE-ONLY
 * form is UTC, while a date-TIME form without an offset is local. So
 * `new Date('2026-08-01')` is UTC midnight, and every getter this module then
 * uses — `getFullYear`, `getMonth`, `getDate`, and `toLocaleDateString`'s own
 * internal ones — reads it back in the VIEWER's zone. West of UTC that lands
 * on the previous calendar day: `2026-08-01` rendered `Jul 31` for a UTC-7
 * viewer while the stored value, the API response and a UTC+8 viewer all said
 * August 1st. The relative branch shifted with it, one day per day
 * (`2026-08-31` read `4 days ago` on the 3rd instead of `3 days ago`),
 * because it compares two LOCAL start-of-days.
 *
 * ## The repair, and why it is not an offset
 *
 * A date-only value names a CALENDAR DAY and carries no instant, so there is
 * no conversion to perform: this rebuilds it at LOCAL midnight of the day it
 * names, and every local getter downstream then reports that same day in
 * every zone. ⛔ Nothing here adds or subtracts hours. An offset that
 * cancels the shift would be wrong again at the next DST boundary and wrong
 * in the opposite direction for a viewer EAST of UTC, where the UTC-midnight
 * parse already lands on the right day — the co-located suite drives both.
 * `GridField`'s sub-grid cell already parsed its own date-only values this
 * way before reaching `formatDate`; this is that treatment, moved to the one
 * place every caller passes through.
 *
 * A value with a time part is untouched, in both spellings: it HAS an
 * instant, and rendering an instant in the viewer's zone is the whole point
 * of a `datetime`. The regex is what separates them, so the split is the
 * VALUE's shape and never the field's declared type, which this module (pure,
 * no schema) cannot see.
 *
 * Acceptance is unchanged, deliberately: the engine's own parse still decides
 * what is a date at all, and only a value it already accepted is rebuilt. So
 * `2026-13-01` is still `—`, and a well-shaped impossible day still ROLLS
 * (`2026-02-30` renders March 2nd) exactly as it did — a pinned behaviour of
 * the shared display path, asserted in `dataset-format.ts`'s date suite.

 *      ±7-day window only — a face change on a live path (grid cell, gantt
 *      tooltip) that no card authorises.
 *   2. **Termination.** `formatDate` resolves `'relative'` by calling
 *      `formatRelativeDate`, which lands back here. With the style still in
 *      the bag, `formatRelativeDate(v, { style: 'relative' })` on an
 *      out-of-window date would recurse until the stack ran out.
 *
 * The bag is returned UNCHANGED when there is nothing to strip, so the common

 *     every call that renders a face today renders the same face after.
 *   - The bag is SHARED across three functions, so it can legitimately carry a

 *     and `t` are read by `formatRelativeDate` alone). A caller that built
 *     `{ style: 'compact', locale }` for `formatDateTime` and reused the bag
 *     for `formatDate(v, 'short', bag)` must keep its short face. A key aimed
 *     at a sibling function must not outrank an argument written for THIS
 *     call — that is objectui#7694's shape (an alias overwriting the canonical
 *     key), and the silent-override half of objectui#4272.
 *
 * `??`, not `||`, is what "absent" means here: `formatDate(v, '', bag)`
 * renders the default face today and must keep doing so, so an empty string
 * counts as GIVEN and does not fall through to the key.
