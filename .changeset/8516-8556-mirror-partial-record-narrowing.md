'@object-ui/types': minor
---

**Breaking for authored metadata, at validation time:** two zod mirrors in
`@object-ui/types/zod` now state their own declaration's key vocabulary instead
of `string` (objectui#8516, objectui#8556).

| key | mirror was | mirror is |
| :-- | :--------- | :-------- |
| `GridSchema.columns` (`zod/layout.zod.ts`) | `z.record(z.string(), z.number())` | a PARTIAL record over the six breakpoints |
| `ReportComponentSchema.exportConfigs` (`zod/reports.zod.ts`) | `z.record(z.string(), ReportExportConfigSchema)` | a PARTIAL record over `ReportExportFormat` |

Both declarations already stated the closed set — `columns` since objectui#8505,
`exportConfigs` since objectui#6121 — so each mirror was accepting a spelling its
own published type refuses. This is a pull-back to the declaration, not a new
constraint: `os-ui validate` / `check` in `@object-ui/cli` are the real consumers
of these mirrors, and they were passing documents `tsc` rejects.

**What now fails that used to pass.** A `grid` whose responsive map is keyed
outside `xs` `sm` `md` `lg` `xl` `2xl` — `{ xxl: 6 }` is the one to expect,
because it is the Bootstrap/Ant spelling an author reaches for first — and a
`report` whose `exportConfigs` is keyed outside `pdf` `excel` `csv` `json`
`html`. Both were ALREADY broken at runtime: the grid renderer reads exactly the
six keys and the export engine exactly the five formats, so a document the
mirror used to accept rendered at the default column count, or exported nothing,
with no error and no warning. The narrowing refuses documents that were already
being silently ignored; it refuses nothing that works today.

**Migration:** `xxl` is `2xl`; `XL` and `2XL` are `xl` and `2xl`. The refusal
names the offending key — `Path: columns → xxl`, `Code: invalid_key` — through
`@object-ui/cli`'s union-arm expansion.

**Measured accept set in the corpus, before grading this.** Counted over every
tracked file in this repository and in the `objectstack` sibling checkout, with
test fixtures and changeset prose separated out rather than folded in:

- grid nodes carrying an object-valued `columns` — **10 authored sites** (nine in
  `content/docs`, `examples/schema-catalog` and `skills/objectui`, one in
  `apps/site`), **all keyed inside the six breakpoints**. Every out-of-vocabulary
  key in either tree sits in a test fixture written to document the defect, or in
  objectui#8505's changeset quoting it.
- `exportConfigs` — **one authored site**, `content/docs/core/report-schema.mdx`,
  keyed `pdf` / `excel` / `csv`, all **in vocabulary**. None in `objectstack`.

So this narrowing refuses **zero** documents that exist today, which is why it is
graded `minor` with the break spelled out rather than escalated.

**What it does NOT close.** These mirrors judge the document they are handed. A
`grid` nested under another node's `children` still reaches
`SchemaNodeSchema`, a lazy union over the passthrough base that does not re-enter
the per-type arms, so `{ type: 'container', children: [{ type: 'grid', columns:
{ xxl: 6 } }] }` still validates green. That is pre-existing and untouched here —
named so this change is not read as closing the nested case.

**The spelling is `z.partialRecord`, and that is load-bearing.** ⛔ Not
`z.record(z.enum([…]), …)`: measured on zod 4.4.3, the plain record over an enum
key REQUIRES every member, so `{ md: 2 }` stops parsing — it would trade this
divergence for its exact opposite, and on `exportConfigs` it would re-impose the
total-`Record` authoring face objectui#6121's maintainer ruling removed. That
measurement is pinned executably in
`__tests__/mirror-partial-record-narrowing-8516.test.ts`, at compile time (the
inferred map is `Partial<Record<…>>`, not `Record<…>`) and at run time (one
accepting row per member), so it cannot rot into folklore.

⚠️ **Dated note, 2026-10-02 — the CLI reports `{ xxl: 6 }` as `unrecognized_keys` at `columns` — objectui#11073.** The Migration paragraph says the refusal reads `Path: columns → xxl`, `Code: invalid_key`, through `@object-ui/cli`'s union-arm expansion. Measured through `objectui validate`'s printer on objectui#11505's branch, it now reads `1. Unrecognized key: "xxl"`, `Path: columns`, `Code: unrecognized_keys`, as a top-level issue with no union-arm line under it. The verdict is unchanged: `{ xxl: 6 }` is refused, and the message still names `xxl`. The change of code is attributed to objectui#11073's zod 4.6 resolution (the rider on objectui#11505 names it); this note measured the present answer, not the transition. The rest of this entry is kept as the reading of this change.
