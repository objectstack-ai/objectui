/**
 * [#6108] The toolbar sort picker consumes the platform's per-column
 * sortability signal — objectstack#10235 ruling A, through #5729's landed
 * spelling (`isPlatformSortableField`). It used to re-derive the same verdict
 * from the field's TYPE, via `UNMATERIALIZED_FIELD_TYPES`.
 *
 * ## Why the cells below are the ones they are
 *
 * The predicate that was deleted and the contract that replaced it AGREE about
 * `formula` — the platform computes its own projection from the same
 * `@objectstack/spec` storage fact — and that agreement is exactly why the
 * drift went unnoticed for two cards. So a pin over a formula field would pass
 * against the re-derivation too and prove nothing at all.
 *
 * Every cell here is therefore an input where the two DISAGREE, and this file
 * names each one:
 *
 *  - ABSENCE (`audited_at`). The projection's domain is "the served field map
 *    plus the always-provisioned `id`"; a name absent from it — an unknown
 *    field, a dotted path, an unprovisioned audit column — has no platform
 *    sort behind it (`ObjectSortabilitySchema.fields`, spec). The contract
 *    withholds. A type read sees `datetime`, not `formula`, and offers it.
 *  - A NON-VIRTUAL REFUSAL (`remote_status`). `sortable: false` with no
 *    `reason: virtual-type` — the shape "any future verdict the runtime doors
 *    add" arrives in. The contract withholds; a type read sees `text` and
 *    offers it.
 *  - THE PLATFORM MOVING (`rolled_total`). A `formula` the projection answers
 *    `sortable: true` for. The contract OFFERS it — the one cell that runs the
 *    opposite direction from the rest, and the one no type read can ever
 *    follow: it withholds on the type alone, forever.
 *
 * Controls sit beside them in the same render, because "the picker offers
 * fewer options" is trivially satisfied by a picker that offers none:
 * `expected_revenue` (a formula both readings withhold), `owner` (the
 * relational carve-out, deliberately NOT delegated to the signal), and the two
 * plain stored columns that stay offered throughout.
 *
 * AGREEMENT over hardcoding, for everything that is not a drift cell: the base
 * projection is produced by the platform's own `resolveObjectSortability`
 * (`@objectstack/spec/api`) — the resolver the REST layer serves it from — so
 * the control cells follow the runtime's predicate rather than a copied table.
