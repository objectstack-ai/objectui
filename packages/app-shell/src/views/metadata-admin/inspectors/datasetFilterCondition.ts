/**
 * Bridge between the visual {@link FilterBuilder} (a flat `FilterGroup` of
 * `{field, operator, value}` rows, camelCase operators) and the spec
 * `FilterCondition` (Mongo-style `{ field: { $op: value } }`, conjoined with
 * `$and`) stored on `dataset.filter` / `measure.filter`.
 *
 * Scope (deliberate): the visual editor supports the common case — a flat AND
 * of simple `field op value` conditions. Anything it can't faithfully round-trip
 * (nested groups, `$or`, multi-operator objects, unmapped operators, and a row
 * the builder cannot hold — see {@link builderHolds}) is reported as NOT
 * representable so the caller can fall back to the source editor instead of
 * silently corrupting the author's filter.
 *
 * The value-less operators are the exception to "field op value": the builder
 * draws no input for them, so the row is complete without one. Both pairs the
 * spec's vocabulary carries — `$exists` (is empty) and `$null` (is null) — are
 * bridged here, in {@link VALUELESS_TO_MONGO}.
 *
 * An operator that is NOT bridged is dropped, and dropping is where the danger
 * used to be: see {@link isClearedGroup} for why an unmapped operator is now
 * inert rather than destructive (objectui#9372).
 *
 * Whether a row is FINISHED is not this file's rule: it is the builder's own
 * `isFilterValueComplete`, the one arity-aware answer every write path asks
 * (objectui#5025). That is what lets the `between` arm map at all — a pair is
 * emitted only with both bounds present (objectui#10062).
 *
 * The write half is deliberately NOT injective — the spec carries one token for
 * "strictly greater", which both `greaterThan` and `after` have to use — so the
 * read half cannot be a plain inverse table. {@link readBackOperator} settles
 * the ambiguous tokens against the field's own operator bucket (objectui#9382).

 * Which builder operator a stored token reads back as, on a field of this type.
 *
 * ## Why the type has to be consulted (objectui#9382)
 *
 * `after` and `greaterThan` both write `$gt`, and the spec's filter vocabulary
 * has exactly one token for "strictly greater" — there is no `$after` for the
 * write half to have used. So the collapse is not a defect in what gets stored:
 * the stored filter is correct and filters correctly. What was lost is only the
 * LABEL, and the label is a function of the field's type, because that is what
 * decides which bucket the dropdown draws.
 *
 * Reading it back with a fixed table therefore handed the date buckets an
 * operator they do not offer. Measured on the pre-fix tree, over every
 * (field type, operator) pair the dropdown can build: 6 pairs broke — `before`
 * and `after` on each of `date`, `datetime` and `time` — and every other pair
 * round-tripped exactly. Driven in the real component, the consequence was a
 * BLANK operator trigger, and `reconcileOperatorForField` then settled that row
 * on `equals` as soon as the author touched its field picker, committing a
 * different filter than the one they had stored.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * Among the operators that write this token, pick the one THIS field's bucket
 * offers. The bucket table is asked rather than copied, so the answer cannot
 * disagree with what the dropdown actually lists; `operatorsForFieldType` is
 * called with no opt-in extras because that is how the inspector mounts the
 * builder.
 *
 * ⛔ Deliberately not a widening. When the type is unknown, or when the bucket
 * offers neither candidate or both, this falls back to {@link MONGO_TO_OP} —
 * the unchanged default — rather than inventing an answer. Nothing new is
 * ACCEPTED here and no stored filter is rewritten; only the operator id the
 * panel is seeded with changes, and it changes to one the panel can draw.
 * Whether the fallback can then be drawn is not this function's question:
 * {@link builderHolds} asks it of every row, this one included.

 *
 *  - switching the only row to an operator this bridge does not map

 *    — a blanked value, or a `between` pair with one bound typed: the
 *    incomplete-row `continue` drops it and the last part goes with it.
 *
 * ## What the caller does with the answer
 *
 * `false` means "rows are still on screen": the caller must patch NOTHING and
 * leave the stored value alone. `true` — no rows at all, i.e. Clear all, or
 * the last row removed — is the author's own gesture and still commits
 * `undefined`.
 *
 * ⛔ Deliberately not "emit something for the unmapped operator". A filter
 * emitted in a spelling that means something else is worse than a dropped one,
 * which is the whole reason the unmapped arm exists; this makes the drop inert,
 * it does not stop it dropping.

 * opens goes back through {@link groupToCondition} as soon as the author
 * touches a SIBLING. A row this answers `false` for is one that commit would
 * rewrite or drop, so the whole filter goes to the Source tab instead. Two
 * questions, both asked of every row, whatever its token:
 *
 *  1. WOULD THE WRITE HALF KEEP IT? Asked of {@link groupToCondition} itself,
 *     not of a copy of its rules, so the two halves cannot give one shape
 *     different answers. This is what refuses an incomplete stored value — a
 *     `{ $eq: '' }`, a `{ $in: [] }`, a half `$between` — which the write half
 *     drops as an unfinished row. Read back as a row, it vanished the moment a
 *     sibling was edited; for `$in: []` that widened the dataset from no rows
 *     to every row.
 *
 *     ⛔ Not fixed on the write side instead. `equals ''` is also the row the
 *     builder SEEDS when "Add condition" is clicked, so a write half that kept
 *     `{ $eq: '' }` would emit a filter for every unfinished row — the
 *     silently-wrong filter its incomplete-row drop exists to prevent. The
 *     write half carries a shape only where a finished row means exactly that
 *     predicate (objectui#9363, objectui#9372); a shape it cannot carry stays
 *     out of the builder.
 *
 *  2. DOES THE COLUMN'S BUCKET OFFER ITS OPERATOR? Read back as an operator the
 *     dropdown does not list — `$in` on a date or number column, `$gt` on a
 *     text one, `$exists` on a boolean one — the panel draws a BLANK operator
 *     trigger (objectui#4768 / #7561), and one touch of the row's field picker
 *     reconciles it to `equals` and reshapes the value, committing a different
 *     filter than the one stored (the objectui#9382 defect). The bucket is
 *     asked exactly as the builder asks it for each row:
 *     `operatorsForFieldType` of the listed column's type, no opt-ins. A column
 *     listed without a type, or not listed at all, gets the builder's default
 *     text bucket for both — the bucket the panel WOULD draw, not an unknown
 *     one. Only a read with NO field list skips this: no caller that draws a
 *     panel reads that way, and it is the pure spec-shape read the field-less
 *     round-trip pins rely on.
 *
 * objectui#10062 asked both questions for the pair arity only, as a guard on
 * the `$between` it had just mapped; this is that guard for every token.
