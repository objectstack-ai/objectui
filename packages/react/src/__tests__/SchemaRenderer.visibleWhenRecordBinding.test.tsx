/**
 * objectui#5454 — the node-level visibility chain, after the 2026-08-21 ruling.
 *
 * Three legs landed together, and each one is pinned here with the polarity
 * pair that makes it a verdict rather than an inability:
 *
 *   1. `record` is BOUND. `@objectstack/spec` has always declared that a page
 *      component's `visibleWhen` binds it (`ui/page.zod.ts`: *"Binds `record`,
 *      `current_user`, `page.<var>`"*), and the evaluator bound no `record` at
 *      all. A `record.*` predicate could not resolve; the surface is fail-soft,
 *      so it resolved to SHOWN — on both polarities of the same predicate, which
 *      is a gate that does not gate.
 *
 *   2. `visibleWhen` OUTRANKS `visible`. The memo hoists `properties.*` onto the
 *      node, so a node carrying `properties.visible` short-circuited the
 *      declared node predicate before it was ever consulted.
 *
 *   3. An unresolvable predicate is LOUD. Fail-soft answers "broken" and "yes"
 *      with the same word, so the author of a typo saw a rendered block and no
 *      signal.
 *
 * ## Every "hidden" here is paired
 *
 * `SchemaRenderer` has several other paths to rendering nothing (an unregistered
 * type, a primitive schema, the error boundary). So no case below reads a bare
 * "nothing rendered" as "the gate said no": each hidden verdict sits beside a
 * mount of the SAME schema that DOES render, differing only in the value under
 * test. A mutation that simply stops rendering fails the pair, not just the case.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted before running)
 *
 * Removing the `record` binding from the evaluator turns RED exactly the
 * polarity pairs in group 1 — and turns them red in the SHOWN direction (the
 * `false` half starts rendering), because fail-soft resolves to shown. It leaves
 * every group-2 and group-3 case green. Restoring `visible` above `visibleWhen`
 * turns RED only group 2. Deleting the `catch` diagnostic turns RED only group 3,
 * and leaves every verdict in groups 1 and 2 untouched — which is the point of
 * leg 3: it moved the silence, not the answer.
