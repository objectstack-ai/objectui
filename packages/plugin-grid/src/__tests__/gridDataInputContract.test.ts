/**
 * `object-grid` — the DECLARED coarse type of `data` must be the one its
 * contract accepts (objectui#5090).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `GRID_QUERY_INPUTS` declared `{ name: 'data', type: 'array', label: 'Static
 * Data', description: 'Inline rows, …' }`, but the contract is
 * `ObjectGridSchema.data?: ViewData` — the spec's discriminated union on
 * `provider`, four strict OBJECT arms (`object` / `api` / `value` / `schema`),
 * none of them an array. The declaration published the shape of `staticData`,
 * the deprecated alias the objectui#4648 carve-out deliberately refuses to
 * publish, under the canonical key's name.
 *
 * Both halves failed quietly, in opposite directions — objectui#4041's shape,
 * one field over:
 *
 *   - an author following the published declaration wrote `data: [ …rows… ]`,
 *     which the renderer honoured at the time (`getDataConfig`'s `Array.isArray`
 *     branch, removed on objectui#8348) but which `tsc` refuses (`TS2322`,
 *     measured) and `ViewDataSchema` refuses;
 *   - the one form that satisfies both — `{ provider: 'value', items: [...] }` —
 *     drew `type-mismatch` from this repo's own save gate, because
 *     `checkType`'s `'array'` arm (`sdui-parser/src/validate.ts`) accepts only
 *     arrays. The platform reported the only legal write as a type error.
 *
 * ## What these tests pin, and why it is DERIVED
 *
 * The subject is the declaration read out of the registry, never a constant
 * restated here — a test spelling `'object'` on both sides would keep passing
 * through exactly the drift it exists to catch. So the expected arms come from
 * `ViewDataSchema`'s own verdicts: one representative value per coarse arm, in
 * the vocabulary `armAccepts` uses, filtered by what the schema accepts. Either
 * side moving turns the comparison red — a spec release that widens `ViewData`
 * to accept an array, or a declaration that grows an arm the contract rejects.
 * That derivation is the discipline `component-input-union-specimens.test.ts`
 * and `text-input-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts` adopted. It used to be the only
 * gate on this fact; objectui#4971 has since added the repo-wide arm direction to
 * `apps/console/src/__tests__/registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts`.
 *
 * ⛔ CORRECTED on objectui#8348 — this docblock used to say that the parity gate
 * "judges against `ComponentPropsMap['object-grid'].data`, which is `z.array()`
 * and DISAGREES with the `ViewDataSchema` this file measures — two spec
 * authorities, opposite kinds, filed as objectui#6207". MEASURED on the
 * `@objectstack/spec` this repo now resolves (17.4.0), that is no longer true:
 * the two authorities CONVERGED. `ComponentPropsMap['object-grid'].data` is the
 * `ViewData` union, and its own description names the refusal — "Static inline
 * rows live at `{ provider: 'value', items: [...] }`; the bare-array shortcut is
 * refused — see migration `object-grid-data-view-data-converged`". The two gates
 * agree and are still not redundant: this file measures the contract
 * `ObjectGridSchema` resolves to, the parity gate measures the repo-wide arm
 * direction.
 *
 * ⭐ The renderer's array tolerance is GONE as of objectui#8348 (decision batch
 * #83, 2026-09-08, maintainer verbatim 「8348 以协议为准」 — the contract decides).
 * This paragraph used to read "NOT asserted away here… it stays as back-compat
 * and is objectui#5068's family; what this file forbids is ADVERTISING it". The
 * ruling removed the thing being un-advertised: `getDataConfig` no longer lifts
 * a bare array, so the declaration and the read now say the same thing. This
 * file still owns the DECLARATION half; the behaviour half — a bare array draws
 * nothing and the block queries its object instead — is pinned next door in
 * `gridBareArrayDataRefused-8348.test.tsx`.
 *
 * The compile-time half needs this package's `tsconfig.test.json`
 * (objectui#3181) — without it the `@ts-expect-error` below is erased before
 * vitest runs and proves nothing.
