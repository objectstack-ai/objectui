Test-only: `packages/types/src/__tests__/zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`. It sits under
`src/`, so the presence gate counts it, but nothing published moves: the package's
build `tsconfig.json` excludes `**/__tests__/**` and its `files` list is `dist` only,
so the file never reaches a consumer. Declared as releasing nothing.

- objectui#8458: the WIDER ledger's objectui#7760 movement sentence said "16 pairs",
  the one figure in that paragraph no `headerFigures` pin reached. Re-derived as 18
  (13 emptied + 5 reduced), defined, and pinned.
- objectui#8222's exclusion note called the seed decomposition a LIVE
  figure, which objectui#8243 made historical. The guidance clause is amended per the
  maintainer ruling (decision batch #71); the two measurement-record clauses are
  untouched, and the record-vs-guidance rule is now written once in the file header.
