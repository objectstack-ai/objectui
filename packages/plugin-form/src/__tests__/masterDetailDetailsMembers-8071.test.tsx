 * `object-master-detail-form.details` — the MEMBER shape THIS block reads
 * (objectui#8071, criterion from objectui#8068).
 *
 * Unlike the three parent keys objectui#8071 slice 15 pinned, `details` is not
 * carried onto the parent `<ObjectForm>`: it is this block's OWN half, and
 * `MasterDetailForm` is its only reader. A member is one detail collection,
 * typed `MasterDetailDetailConfig`.
 *
 * What a member IS is declared on both sides, and both declarations are the
 * spec's since `@objectstack/spec` 17.6.0 (objectstack-ai/objectstack#21215,
 * objectui#11396): the spec row is an array of CLOSED entries — `childObject`
 * required, an undeclared key refused by name, `columns` the spec's inline grid
 * column — and `MasterDetailDetailConfig` is derived from that entry by
 * reference, with ONE stated fork: `@objectstack/spec` 17.6.0 declares
 * `sortField`, which this block does not read (objectui#11070 round 9 retired
 * the authored override; row 2c below pins that a written one reaches
 * nothing); objectstack `main` has since retired it too
 * (objectstack-ai/objectstack#21589, unreleased after 17.6.0), and the fork
 * closes at objectui's bump to the first release carrying that. The registration
 * declares `of: 'object'`, derived from that single-kind member contract. The
 * compile-time block at the end of this file holds the config equal to the
 * spec's entry minus that fork and spells the member list out, so the member
 * count is re-derived by the compiler rather than by this sentence. A
 * declaration fixes an entry's SHAPE, not what this block DOES with a member,
 * so the read site is still the whole member contract, and every row below is
 * measured there.
 *
 * ## Where each member lands
 *
 *   - `title` heads the collection's own section, with `Line Items` as the
 *     fallback. `columns` is handed to the line grid in authored order.
 *   - Four members reach the grid through ONE hand-written object. Since
 *     objectui#11610 renamed the grid's keys to camelCase, three keep their
 *     name (`minRows`, `maxRows`, `addLabel`) and one is RENAMED on the way:
 *     the detail's `amountField` lands on the grid's `totalField`, the CHILD
 *     column summed. ⚠️ The detail's own `totalField` is the PARENT field the
 *     sum is saved to and is NOT forwarded, so the same name carries a
 *     different value on each side. Beside them and `columns`, the object
 *     carries `sortField`, which is no member: the block DERIVES it from the
 *     child object (`deriveDetail` picks its `position` / `sort_order` / …
 *     field), and objectui#11070 round 9 retired the detail's `sortField`
 *     member that used to override it. A member dropped from that object, or
 *     a key the grid does not declare, reaches a grid that reads nothing
 *     there; since objectui#11610 the object is checked against
 *     `GridFieldMetadata` at compile time, and a retired snake_case key there
 *     would draw the grid's named refusal. Row 2 still pins the object as a
 *     SORTED KEY SET and not as a few spot values.
 *   - `inlineMode` and `formFields` choose the form factor: list-plus-form or
 *     editable cells, and whether a row can be opened in the full form.
 *   - `childObject` and `relationshipField` address the collection's writes
 *     (the child legs of the atomic batch) and its edit-mode read.
 *     `amountField` and `totalField` roll the lines up into the PARENT leg.
 *   - With only `childObject` authored, the relationship field and the columns
 *     are DERIVED from the child object's metadata. That is the one behaviour
 *     the spec's description promises ("FK and columns auto-derive from child
 *     metadata").
 *
 * ## The rows
 *
 *   1. Each member renders as its own section, in AUTHORED order, headed by
 *      `title` (or `Line Items`), with `columns` in authored order.
 *   2. The grid object is exactly six keys. Each authored member arrives under
 *      the grid's key, and off-list members are NOT forwarded, including
 *      one written in the grid's own spelling (`allowAdd`).
 *   2c. `sortField` is no member (objectui#11070 round 9). On a detail the
 *      block derives, the grid's `sortField` is the child's sort-named field
 *      even when a `sortField` naming another field is written beside it. On
 *      a fully configured detail, which derives nothing, a written one leaves
 *      the grid's `sortField` empty. The compile-time block at the end of this
 *      file refuses the member by name.
 *   3. `inlineMode: 'form'` turns the grid into a list with an `Add` action.
 *      In grid mode, `formFields` wider than `columns` offers the row form, and
 *      without that the offer is withheld. Each arm is the control for the
 *      other.
 *   4. The atomic batch: each line becomes a create on `childObject`, linked
 *      back through `relationshipField`. `totalField` receives the sum of the
 *      lines' `amountField` on the PARENT leg, and a collection with no
 *      `totalField` puts nothing on the parent.
 *   5. `{ childObject }` alone: the FK is the child field that references the
 *      parent, the columns come from the child's editable fields (FK
 *      excluded), and the derived FK is the one the batch writes.
 *   6. `edit` mode: each collection's lines are read from `childObject`,
 *      scoped by `relationshipField` to the parent record, capped at 500.
 *   7. The non-vacuity control: `details: []` renders no section and mounts no
 *      grid, and the batch carries the parent leg alone.
 *
 * ⛔ Deliberately NOT re-asserted, because a neighbour owns it and a copy buys
 * nothing: a member with no `childObject`
 * (`MasterDetailForm.detailChildObjectDecline.test.tsx`), a child schema that
 * cannot be loaded (`MasterDetailForm.detailSchemaFetchFailure.test.tsx`), a
 * derive that finds no relationship field
 * (`MasterDetailForm.detailDeriveFailure.test.tsx`), entry identity across a
 * reorder (`MasterDetailForm.detailEntryIdentity.test.tsx`), and the unit-level
 * derive rules (`deriveMasterDetail.test.ts`). This file pins what a member IS
 * and where each of its keys lands.

 * (objectui#11396): a member the spec adds, drops or retypes lands on the
 * config with no hand edit, and a hand-written restatement that drifts is red
 * here before it is red anywhere else. It holds on both spec shapes this
 * repository is compiled against: 17.6.0, where the entry declares `sortField`
 * as a string, and objectstack `main`, where the entry carries a `retiredKey()`
 * tombstone for it (objectstack-ai/objectstack#21589, unreleased after 17.6.0)
 * — the subtraction removes the key either way. ⛔ No row here pins which of
 * the two shapes the spec has; the `Spec Main Shape Gate` compiles this file
 * against `main`, so such a row is red there the day the two differ. The
 * forward tripwire for the retirement is the runtime pin in `@object-ui/types`
 * (`object-master-detail-form-details-entry-11396.test.ts`), which records
 * `sortField` as ACCEPTED on 17.6.0 and flips at the bump.
