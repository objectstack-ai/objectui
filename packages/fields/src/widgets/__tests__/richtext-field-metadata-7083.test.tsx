 * `RichtextFieldMetadata` — the third registry key of one widget becomes
 * DECLARABLE (objectui#7083, maintainer ruling of 2026-09-07, batch #71).
 *
 * ## What was missing, and why a cast was the only evidence
 *
 * `markdown`, `html` and `richtext` are one widget (objectui#5498). Two of the
 * three carried an exported metadata type; `richtext` carried none, so the
 * runtime served it happily by structure while an author could not write its
 * metadata under an annotation at all. The state was neither a union member
 * nor a recorded alias — a silent gap whose ONLY trace was a deliberate
 * `as unknown as MarkdownFieldMetadata` in `RichTextField.rows.test.tsx`. That
 * cast is gone; this file is what replaces it, so the gap cannot be
 * rediscovered by the next reader who trips over a cast.
 *
 * ## The pin has two halves and needs both
 *
 * The ruling asks that "a typed `richtext` literal compiles AND the widget
 * renders it", and the compile half is not decoration: a pin that only rendered
 * would still pass with the cast in place, which is the state this card ends.
 *
 *  - COMPILE — {@link richtextField} below is an annotated literal, so TypeScript's
 *    excess-property check judges every key in it, and it is assigned to
 *    `FieldMetadata` to pin the UNION membership the ruling actually granted.
 *    On the pre-change tree this file does not compile at all: there is no
 *    member to annotate against, which is what makes this leg non-vacuous.
 *  - RENDER — every key of the derived read set is then asserted at the DOM,
 *    each against a control that changes only that key, so a green here reads
 *    "the widget consumed the declared key" and never "the default happened to
 *    match".
 *
 * ## The read set is DERIVED from `RichTextField.tsx`, not copied
 *
 * `type` (`resolveRichTextFieldType`, the discriminator), `rows`
 * (`richField?.rows || 8`), `placeholder`, `mobile_fullscreen` and `label` are
 * the five keys the widget reads off this carrier on the `richtext` path; the
 * readonly branch hands `field` to a `RICH_TEXT_CELL_RENDERERS` entry, and both
 * renderers there read `value` only. The sixth key, `maxLength`, is read by
 * the widget too (the native stop and the counter, objectui#8438) and by the
 * FORM: `buildValidationRules` is generic and compiles it into a submit-time
 * rule for every field. It is `@objectstack/spec`'s `FieldSchema.maxLength`
 * by reference, and it replaced the snake_case `max_length` when objectui#11070
 * retired that spelling. The last group below pins the spec-boundary reading
 * for the two spellings — see the member's own docblock in
 * `packages/types/src/field-types.ts`.
