/**
 * `packages/plugin-gantt/README.md`'s record-navigation example is PARSED by
 * the schema that validates it — `@objectstack/spec`'s `NavigationConfigSchema`
 * (objectui#6050).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The example documented `{ mode: 'page', basePath: '/console/apps/.../campaign' }`.
 * `basePath` is not a `NavigationConfig` member, and no read site consumes it:
 * `useNavigationOverlay` — where a gantt's `navigation` lands — builds no URL
 * out of the config at all, and `ObjectGantt` calls it with no `onNavigate`, so
 * a page-mode click falls through to the host's `onRowClick`. The destination
 * route was never authorable through that key, by any spelling.
 *
 * That made the snippet worse than inert. `NavigationConfigSchema` is a strict
 * object, so the undeclared key did not fall away quietly — it REJECTED the
 * whole config (`unrecognized_keys`), and the `mode: 'page'` the sentence was
 * actually teaching never took effect. An author copying the documented snippet
 * got a rejected navigation config.
 *
 * It was found exactly this way: objectui#5903's pin test used this README's
 * example verbatim as its "well-typed" fixture, and the fixture failed.
 *
 * ## No gate in this repo can catch it, which is the point
 *
 * `check-doc-snippet-types` compiles `ts`/`tsx` fences and
 * `check-doc-component-types` reads `type` literals; both are structurally
 * blind to a metadata key in a README. That gate's own header names the hole:
 * schema-key validity is "a different question with a different answer …
 * left unruled on purpose". A README example can be rejected by the spec while
 * every gate stays green. This test is the measurement that closes it for this
 * one example.
 *
 * ## The example is EXTRACTED, never retyped
 *
 * The fence is read out of the README on every run and parsed as JSON. A hand
 * copy drifts from the file it claims to pin and therefore pins nothing — a
 * snippet nobody re-measured is the defect this test exists to prevent, so
 * reproducing it inside the test would be self-defeating. A moved heading, a
 * removed fence or a non-JSON body throws out of the extractor rather than
 * vacuously passing on an empty fixture.
 *
 * ## The green carries its own control
 *
 * A `safeParse` that succeeds proves nothing on its own if the schema accepts
 * everything, so the historical shape is parsed alongside and must be REJECTED
 * by name. The pair is the measurement; neither half alone is one.
 *
 * ## The PROSE is pinned too, not only the fence (objectui#9987)
 *
 * The fence was clean and the paragraph around it was not. It INSTRUCTED the
 * reader to write `navigation.view` -- the member objectstack#18619 retired
 * under ADR-0049 -- and then, in the same breath, explained the mechanism by
 * which an undeclared key rejects the whole config. The first sentence caused
 * what the second diagnosed, and a reader who stops at the instruction never
 * reaches the contradiction. This README ships inside the npm tarball
 * (`files: ["dist", "README.md", ...]`), so the instruction was published.
 *
 * The fence tests above could not see it: they extract the ```json block and
 * the block never carried the key. An instruction can live entirely in prose,
 * which is why the prose is measured here too.
 *
 * WARNING: no schema this package installs can derive that key's retirement.
 * The pinned `@objectstack/spec@17.4.0` still DECLARES `view`, so
 * `declaredMembers()` reports it legal and every schema-derived statement about
 * it is vacuous in this tree; the retirement lands it as a tombstone (typed
 * `never`, raising a prescription at parse) only when the pin moves. It is
 * therefore named by hand, exactly as `basePath` already is -- and the absence
 * carries its own control: the same detector is run over the sentence that used
 * to carry the instruction, in the same file, and must find it there.
