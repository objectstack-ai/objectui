/**
 * objectui#8581 — an UNPARSABLE date string drew `formatDate`'s hand-rolled
 * em-dash, and the sibling renderer one function down already disagreed.
 *
 * `DateCellRenderer` handed any value to `formatDate`, which returns its own
 * `'—'` for anything whose `new Date(...)` is invalid, and wrapped that string
 * in a SPAN classed `tabular-nums` with the raw value as `title`. So a `date`
 * column holding `not-a-date` painted naked punctuation: no `data-slot` of
 * `empty-value`, no accessible name, nothing a screen reader can name. That is
 * the objectui#8475 (`RelatedList`) / objectui#8491 (`ObjectGrid`) class of
 * defect, and objectui#8490 routed this renderer's COERCED-EMPTY input (`[]`,
 * `''`, whitespace) to the shared affordance while deliberately leaving this
 * one — the other input reaching the same dash — to a card of its own.
 *
 * ── The ruling, and the arm that was refused ──────────────────────────────
 * The maintainer seat ruled ARM 1: match `DateTimeCellRenderer` and render the
 * shared `EmptyValue`, on NEAREST-SIBLING PARITY. The sibling is one function
 * down in this same barrel, answers the IDENTICAL input
 * (`date === null || isNaN(date.getTime())`), and has returned `EmptyValue`
 * for it all along; two renderers of one data family disagreeing about one
 * input is the shape this repo keeps paying for.
 *
 * Arm 2 — print the raw text, the way `NumberCellRenderer` and
 * `PercentCellRenderer` print `String(safe)` on their NaN branch — is on the
 * record as a real argument and NOT as a mistake: "No value" is a statement
 * about a cell that does hold *something*. It lost because a *date* renderer's
 * nearest precedent is the other *date* renderer. Both arms delete the bare
 * dash; "leave it" was never an arm.
 *
 * ── The cost, measured rather than assumed ────────────────────────────────
 * Arm 1 discards the `title` the invalid branch carried (the raw value on
 * hover). Before implementing, the tree was searched for any consumer of it —
 * `ByTitle` queries, `[title=...]` selectors, `getAttribute('title')` reads,
 * snapshots, e2e specs, export paths — with lit controls on the same command
 * shapes (`getAttribute('title')`: 33 hits elsewhere; `getAttribute('data-slot')`:
 * 10). Zero read THIS `title`; `isoString` occurred only at its assignment and
 * its one use. A PARSEABLE value keeps its `title`, and the POPULATED block
 * below pins exactly that, so the half arm 1 does not touch stays measured.
 *
 * ── Why `DateTimeCellRenderer` runs here as a LIVE CONTROL ────────────────
 * The claim of this card is "the two siblings now agree". Asserting it about
 * `date` alone would be an assertion; driving BOTH through the same
 * `renderCell` command shape, in the same file, makes it a measurement — and
 * it is the control that refuses a harness which rendered nothing at all. The
 * `datetime` rows below were green BEFORE this change and must stay green:
 * they move if someone ever "unifies" the two renderers in the wrong
 * direction. The POPULATED `datetime` row is the liveness half — a harness
 * whose renderer silently produced an empty container would pass every
 * absence assertion in this file and fail that one.
 *
 * ── One sibling pin moved with this change, by its own instruction ───────
 * `cellRenderers.objectLiteral-8596.test.tsx` recorded `date` holding `{}` as
 * a dash that is NOT the affordance, and said in as many words that a fix
 * landing on this renderer "would have to move a pin rather than pass
 * silently". It did: `{}` coerces to `[Object]`, which `new Date` rejects, so
 * that row now reads the affordance. Its census row and its BOUNDARY case were
 * updated with this change — the only edit outside this file and the renderer.
 *
 * ── Why the fix is at the RENDERER and not in `formatDate` ────────────────
 * `formatDate` is a SHARED formatter in `@object-ui/core` with nine other call
 * sites (`ObjectGrid`'s two, `ObjectGantt`'s two, `DateField`, `FormulaField`,
 * `GridField`, `lookupColumnDisplay`, `dataset-format`'s measure, and
 * `data-table`'s timestamp column) — every one of them a STRING consumer that
 * has no `EmptyValue` to return, and two landed pins assert its `'—'` return
 * directly (`core`'s `date-display.optionsStyle-7745` on `'not a date'`, and
 * this package's `date-formatter-residue-4272` on the datetime twin). Moving
 * the dash at its source would change eight faces to fix one cell. The
 * renderer intercept is co-extensive with this cell and nothing else.
 *
 * ── Why the defect leg asserts the SPAN'S ABSENCE first ───────────────────
 * Same convention as objectui#8490's pin: on the unfixed tree the first
 * sentence to fail is "the value span must not be drawn around a value the
 * renderer cannot format", which is textually distinct from the failure of a
 * harness that has lost its navigation target ("the shared affordance must be
 * present"). Observed as two different sentences, not predicted.
