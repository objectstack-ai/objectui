/**
 * date-display - the ONE date/datetime display path behind every field cell,
 * grid card, gantt tooltip and dataset measure in the console.
 *
 * These functions are unchanged; what changed is where they live. They were
 * written in `@object-ui/fields`' barrel (`packages/fields/src/index.tsx`),
 * which is a React package, so `@object-ui/core` could not reach them - and
 * `core`'s `utils/dataset-format.ts` is exactly the caller that needed them:
 * `formatMeasure` returned `String(v)` for any non-numeric value, so a `min` /
 * `max` measure over a date field rendered its raw 24-character ISO string on
 * the metric tile, in chart values, in dataset table cells and in the
 * metadata-admin dataset preview (objectui#7178).
 *
 * The fix is the move, NOT a second formatter here. That choice is the whole
 * point, and it is the lesson of objectui#4576: when the percent convention
 * was duplicated across this same package boundary, a list cell and a
 * dashboard measure drifted apart (`1.234,5 %` beside `1.234,5%` in a German
 * session) while both were "correct". `dataset-format.ts`'s own header records
 * that history, and `number-display.ts` next door is the same remedy applied
 * to numbers: the pure function moves DOWN into the React-free engine and the
 * upper package re-exports it, so there is one home and nothing to drift.
 *
 * `@object-ui/fields` re-exports the formatting symbols below under their
 * original names, so `formatDate` / `formatDateTime` /
 * `formatDateTimeCompactParts` / `formatRelativeDate` / `DateDisplayOptions`
 * keep working unchanged for `ObjectGrid`, `ObjectGantt`,
 * `plugin-dashboard`'s `recordFields` and the `date` cell renderer.
 * `toDisplayDate` is exported from `@object-ui/core` alone (objectui#10183),
 * and so are `toDisplayEndDate` / `toInclusiveEndDay`, the end read and its
 * inverse both gantt surfaces share (objectui#11141).
 *
 * The `datetime` CELL face joined this file in objectui#7443. It used to be a
 * second convention inlined in `DateTimeCellRenderer`: two `Intl` option bags
 * for one field type, kept in step by nothing, while `date` had exactly one.
 * It is `formatDateTime`'s `'compact'` style now, byte-identical to what the
 * cell rendered before.
 *
 * No React, no i18n: the ambient inputs are `Intl`, the clock and the display
 * zone below, and the one phrase `Intl` cannot produce ("Overdue Nd") comes
 * in through the INJECTED `options.t`, the same way `buildDatasetFieldHelpers`
 * in `dataset-format.ts` takes `fieldLabel`.
 *
 * ⚠️ There is a third ambient input, and it is the one this module has to
 * decide about rather than pass on: the zone an instant renders in. A value
 * carrying a time is an instant and renders in the DISPLAY ZONE — the zone the
 * host declared through {@link setDisplayTimeZone} (objectui#11693), else the
 * viewer's own; a DATE-ONLY value names a calendar day, carries no instant,
 * and must render as that day everywhere, whatever the display zone.
 * `toDisplayDate` below is the single parse step that tells the two apart —
 * every function here goes through it (objectui#10110), and so does every
 * caller elsewhere that needs a face or a day comparison none of these
 * functions produce (objectui#10183).

 *
 * ## Why this lives here (objectui#10026)
 *
 * It used to be module-private in `@object-ui/components`' filter builder,
 * which refused `2026-02-30` at the AUTHORING boundary, while this module — a
 * package below it, unable to import it — ROLLED the same value into March 2nd
 * on every display face. One concept, two answers. It moved down, exactly as
 * `formatDate` itself moved into this package (see the header), so the filter
 * builder and {@link toDisplayDate} now ask the one function. ⛔ A move, not a
 * copy: `@object-ui/components` imports it from here.
 *
 * ## Why the engine cannot answer this on its own
 *
 * ECMAScript's date-string parse accepts a DAY of `01`-`31` for every month
 * and rolls the surplus forward: `Date.parse('2026-02-30')` is March 2nd, not
 * `NaN`. It rejects an out-of-range MONTH (`2026-13-01`), which is why a
 * bad month was always a dash on the display path and a bad day never was.
 * So the day is read back instead: build the date in UTC (no zone, so no DST
 * gap can move it) and require all three parts to survive.
 *
 * `setUTCFullYear` rather than `Date.UTC(year, …)`: the latter maps years
 * 0-99 onto 1900+y, so it answered `false` for `0026-08-01` — a real day,
 * and one {@link toDisplayDate} renders (it undoes the same legacy mapping for
 * the same reason). The move had to fix that, or refusing through this
 * function would have dashed every year below 100.

/**
 * The ONE `value -> Date` step behind every function below.
 *
 * ## The defect (objectui#10110)
 *
 * ECMAScript parses the two ISO shapes into two different zones: a DATE-ONLY
 * form is UTC, while a date-TIME form without an offset is local. So
 * `new Date('2026-08-01')` is UTC midnight, and every getter this module then
 * uses — `getFullYear`, `getMonth`, `getDate`, and `toLocaleDateString`'s own
 * internal ones — reads it back in the VIEWER's zone. West of UTC that lands
 * on the previous calendar day: `2026-08-01` rendered `Jul 31` for a UTC-7
 * viewer while the stored value, the API response and a UTC+8 viewer all said
 * August 1st. The relative branch shifted with it, one day per day
 * (`2026-08-31` read `4 days ago` on the 3rd instead of `3 days ago`),
 * because it compares two LOCAL start-of-days.
 *
 * ## The repair, and why it is not an offset
 *
 * A date-only value names a CALENDAR DAY and carries no instant, so there is
 * no conversion to perform: this rebuilds it at LOCAL midnight of the day it
 * names, and every local getter downstream then reports that same day in
 * every zone. ⛔ Nothing here adds or subtracts hours. An offset that
 * cancels the shift would be wrong again at the next DST boundary and wrong
 * in the opposite direction for a viewer EAST of UTC, where the UTC-midnight
 * parse already lands on the right day — the co-located suite drives both.
 * `GridField`'s sub-grid cell already parsed its own date-only values this
 * way before reaching `formatDate`; this is that treatment, moved to the one
 * place every caller passes through (the sub-grid reads it from here since
 * objectui#10301).
 *
 * A value with a time part is not rebuilt, in both spellings: it HAS an
 * instant, and rendering an instant in the viewer's zone is the whole point
 * of a `datetime`. The regex is what separates them, so the split is the
 * VALUE's shape and never the field's declared type, which this module (pure,
 * no schema) cannot see.
 *
 * ## What it refuses (objectui#10026)
 *
 * The engine's own parse still decides what is a date at all (`2026-13-01`
 * is an Invalid Date, and so every face below renders `—`), with ONE
 * addition: a date-only value naming a day its month does not have. The
 * engine accepts `2026-02-30` and rolls it into March 2nd, so before this
 * card every date face showed a real day nobody wrote, with nothing to say
 * so. This step hands back an Invalid Date for it instead — the same answer
 * the engine gives a bad month — so every caller renders the face it already
 * renders for an unparsable value: `—` from the functions below, `EmptyValue`
 * from the field carriers that read validity here, the raw stored string from
 * a caller whose unparsable face is the raw string. ⛔ No new marker.
 *
 * The maintainer's ruling on objectui#10026 (option A) placed the refusal on
 * the SHARED path, in this step and not in any one consumer: refusing in a
 * single face would re-create the list-cell-versus-measure split
 * objectui#4576 recorded. {@link isRealCalendarDate} is the one judgement,
 * shared with the filter builder's authoring boundary.
 *
 * A value that carries a TIME is refused the same way when the day it is
 * written on does not exist (objectui#10301): `2026-02-30T10:00:00Z` parses
 * too, and rendered `Mar 2, 2026, 10:00 AM` on every datetime face. Triage
 * graded that an inherited branch of the same ruling. The judgement reads the
 * value's leading `YYYY-MM-DD` AS WRITTEN, never the day its instant lands on
 * in some zone: a parsed `Date` always names a real day, so a check made after
 * any conversion could only miss the refusal, and a real day written with an
 * offset (`2026-02-28T23:30:00-05:00`, March 1st in UTC) is kept. A real
 * date-time is otherwise untouched — no rebuild, the engine's instant.
 *
 * ## Why it is exported (objectui#10183)
 *
 * A caller that formats with its own `Intl` options — a face none of the
 * functions below produce, such as the record summary chip's
 * `dateStyle: 'medium'` — or that compares a value against "today" needs the
 * `Date` itself, not a string. Such callers used to parse the value on their
 * own (`new Date(value)`, or `Date.parse` and then a `Date` handed to
 * `formatDate`, which this step then leaves alone), so the objectui#10110
 * repair never reached them and each still read a date-only value one day
 * early west of UTC. They take the `Date` from here instead.
 *
 * ⛔ Read the result with LOCAL getters or local-zone `Intl` formatting only.
 * For a date-only value it is local midnight of the named day, so its
 * `toISOString()` / UTC getters name the previous day east of UTC — hand
 * those the stored value, never this. The faces in this module know such a
 * `Date` when they are handed one and keep it out of the display zone
 * (objectui#11693, see `calendarDays`).

 *
 * ⛔ One rule, one place: `plugin-timeline`'s gantt variant and

/**
 * Format date value.
 *
 * The named face comes from EITHER spelling — the positional `style`
 * parameter or `options.style` — and the precedence between them is pinned
 * (objectui#7745):
 *
 * > **The positional argument wins. `options.style` is consulted only when the
 * > positional slot is `undefined`.**
 *
 * Before #7745 only the positional spelling was read here, while
 * {@link formatDateTime} read only the `options` one — one shared bag, two
 * spellings for one concept, and on THIS function the options spelling did
 * nothing at all: `formatDate(v, undefined, { style: 'short' })` silently
 * rendered the default face with no diagnostic. Reading the key is the
 * additive half of the maintainer's long-run ruling on objectui#7443.
 *
 * Why the positional wins, and not the newer key:
 *
 *   - It is the ONLY direction that is purely additive. It fires exactly on
 *     the input that is a silent no-op today (positional absent, key present);
 *     every call that renders a face today renders the same face after.
 *   - The bag is SHARED across three functions, so it can legitimately carry a
 *     key meant for a sibling — that is this module's convention (`dueLike`
 *     and `t` are read by `formatRelativeDate` alone). A caller that built
 *     `{ style: 'compact', locale }` for `formatDateTime` and reused the bag
 *     for `formatDate(v, 'short', bag)` must keep its short face. A key aimed
 *     at a sibling function must not outrank an argument written for THIS
 *     call — that is objectui#7694's shape (an alias overwriting the canonical
 *     key), and the silent-override half of objectui#4272.
 *
 * `??`, not `||`, is what "absent" means here: `formatDate(v, '', bag)`
 * renders the default face today and must keep doing so, so an empty string
 * counts as GIVEN and does not fall through to the key.

 *     `Jul 4, 2024, 07:00 AM` in `en-US`. Unchanged, and still what a

 *
 * The signature is `(value, options?)`, unchanged: `style` is a key of
 * `options`, not a positional parameter, so every existing call —
 * `formatDateTime(v, { locale })` included — keeps meaning exactly what it
 * meant (see the note on `DateDisplayOptions.style` for why the positional
 * shape `formatDate` uses was refused here).
 *
 * `options` is optional, so a caller that passes nothing keeps the exact
 * runtime-default behavior it had. Before objectui#4272 the parameter did not
 * exist at all, which meant no caller could localize this function however
 * hard it tried — it always handed `Intl` an `undefined` tag, i.e. the
 * MACHINE's locale, which is neither of the repo's two locale channels.
 * Callers should pass the tag from `useDisplayLocale()`.
 *
 * The zone is NOT an option: an instant renders in the display zone the host
 * declared with {@link setDisplayTimeZone}, else the viewer's, on every face
 * this module produces (objectui#11693).
