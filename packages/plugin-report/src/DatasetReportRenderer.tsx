/**
 * DatasetReportRenderer
 *
 * Renders a spec `Report` that binds to a semantic-layer `dataset` (ADR-0021
 * single-form) instead of an inline `objectName` + `columns` query. The report
 * selects dimensions (`rows`, and for matrix also `columns`) and measures
 * (`values`) BY NAME and runs them through `dataSource.queryDataset` — the
 * same governed path dataset-bound dashboard widgets and the dataset preview
 * use, so the numbers (and the server-resolved dimension display labels)
 * match everywhere.
 *
 * - `tabular` → the selection as a simple list (`rows` + `values`), no totals.
 * - `summary` → the same table plus a SERVER-computed grand-total footer
 *   (`totals: { groupings: [[]] }`) — the declared type picks the branch
 *   (#2941), the data shape never does.
 * - `matrix` → a true cross-tab (ADR-0021 D2): `rows` down × `columns`
 *   across, measures in the cells. One dataset query over all dimensions,
 *   pivoted client-side. Totals (per-row subtotals, per-column subtotals,
 *   grand total) are SERVER-supplied: the selection asks for
 *   `totals: { groupings: [rows, columns, []] }` and the renderer only
 *   places the returned pre-aggregated rows. It never re-aggregates bucketed
 *   values client-side — measures like `avg` cannot be recombined without
 *   drifting from the semantic layer (the ADR-0021 governance red line) —
 *   so an older server that returns no `totals` renders the plain cross-tab
 *   with no totals row/column. A matrix without `columns` degrades to the
 *   flat grouped table.
 * - `joined` → a vertical stack of blocks, each its own dataset-bound table,
 *   with the report-level `runtimeFilter` merged into every block.
 *
 * Headers and measure cells mirror the dashboard `DatasetWidget` (PR #1825):
 * column headers use the dataset's server-supplied display `label` (run
 * through the i18n field-label convention), and measure values format with
 * the field's declared `currency` (`Intl` symbol) + numeral `format`, never
 * the raw field name or a misleading "$".
 *
 * Ordering (framework#3916): a report's `order` — a list of `{ by, direction }`
 * keys, most significant first — is lowered onto the dataset selection, so the
 * SERVER orders the whole grid (after measure-scoped filters merge and derived
 * measures evaluate) and this renderer only places the rows it is handed. It is
 * never a client-side re-sort: sorting here would order the truncated page
 * rather than the query, and could not sort by a derived measure at all.
 *
 * For a matrix that also decides the ACROSS axis: `colHeaders` are collected in
 * row-arrival order, so ordering the rows by the across dimension is what makes
 * the columns read left-to-right in that order. Declaring nothing still reads
 * correctly — the server defaults a selected time dimension to ascending, which
 * is what makes month/quarter columns chronological out of the box.
 *
 * Drill-down (ADR-0021 D2): when the report's `drilldown` flag is not `false`
 * and the host supplies `onDrill`, every aggregated row / matrix cell is
 * clickable and emits `{ dataset, groupKey, runtimeFilter }`. The HOST owns
 * navigation — it resolves the dataset's `object` and dimension→field mapping
 * (this renderer only knows dimension NAMES) and routes to the underlying
 * records.

/**
 * Render a report's embedded `chart` (ADR-0021) by running its OWN dataset
 * query — the `xAxis` dimension grouped, the `yAxis` measure aggregated — and
 * feeding the rows to the registered generic chart component (plugin-charts).
 *
 * Decoupled via {@link ComponentRegistry} (same approach as the legacy
 * renderer) so plugin-report keeps no hard dependency on plugin-charts: if the
 * chart plugin isn't loaded, or the chart is incomplete, we render nothing and
 * let the grouped table stand alone. Before this, a dataset-bound report's
 * `chart` config was authorable in Studio but never rendered anywhere.
 *
 * ## What reaches the chart component (objectui#4877 / objectui#4878)
 *
 * This slot forwarded exactly six keys — `chartType`, `data`, `height`,
 * `isAnimationActive`, `series`, `xAxisKey` — which made it the one dataset
 * chart surface that shared neither half of the ruled split:
 *
 *  - the DATA half now routes through `buildChartSeries` (objectui#4878), so the
 *    null-category family it owns is inherited rather than re-derived; the rows
 *    used to reach the renderer with a raw null category, which draws no mark;
 *  - the PRESENTATION half now routes through `chartConfigPresentation` +
 *    `mergeAuthoredSeries` (objectui#4877), so the chrome and per-series keys
 *    `ReportChartSchema` declares stop being inert metadata. `showLegend: false`
 *    was the sharpest of those: dropped, it read as absent, and absent means the
 *    legend is ON — the author's explicit value inverted in effect.
 *
 * Both helpers live in `@object-ui/core` beside each other, which is what keeps
 * this surface and the dashboard widget lowering ONE vocabulary once.
 *
 * ## The category dimension's own colours + declared order (objectui#4906)
 *
 * `chartConfigPresentation` takes a SECOND argument — the category dimension's
 * own option colours, resolved from its select/lookup field metadata — and
 * merges it UNDER an explicit author `colors` map, never over it (the
 * precedence `chartConfigPresentation`'s own doc comment states). Until this
 * card the report chart called it with no second argument at all, so a
 * dimension like `health` never painted its own green/amber/red the way the
 * SAME dimension does on a dashboard chart — only an authored `colors` record
 * ever reached the renderer, and with none authored the chart fell to the
 * positional palette.
 *
 * `categoryOrder` (framework#3588 — a picklist's declared option order IS the
 * domain order) is the same story: derived below from the SAME field metadata
 * and spread onto the chart schema, so a funnel's stages render in the
 * declared pipeline order instead of sorting by value.
 *
 * Both are derived through `useDatasetDimensionMeta` — the exact hook and the
 * exact `localizeFieldOptions` → `buildOptionColorMap` / `buildCategoryOrder`
 * chain `DatasetWidget` (plugin-dashboard) already runs for its own chart —
 * reused here rather than re-derived, which is the whole point: a second,
 * independently-written copy of the same rule is the defect shape this repo
 * keeps paying for (objectui#5301's four-copy resolver, one of them inverted).
