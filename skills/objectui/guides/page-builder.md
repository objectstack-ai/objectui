# ObjectUI SDUI Page Builder

Building production pages with the Schema-Driven UI engine, for app developers.

## Standard workflow

### 1. Frame the page contract first

Before writing implementation code, define:

- Page purpose (dashboard, list, detail, form, wizard, board).
- Required data inputs and output actions.
- User roles and visibility rules.
- Interaction model (navigation, submit, bulk actions, modals).

Then produce a first schema draft.

### 2. Select the right package boundaries

Use these boundaries in guidance and generated code:

- `@object-ui/types`: schema and typed interfaces.
- `@object-ui/core`: expression/action/registry logic.
- `@object-ui/components`: base visual components and wrappers.
- `@object-ui/fields`: form input renderers.
- `@object-ui/layout`: shell and page composition.
- `@object-ui/plugin-*`: heavy feature widgets (grid, charts, kanban, map).
- `@object-ui/react`: `SchemaRenderer`, provider wiring, runtime bridge.

When helping third-party apps, consume these packages; avoid duplicating core runtime logic in the app layer.

### 3. Compose schema using proven node shape

Use a strict component schema shape similar to:

<!-- os:check -->
```json
{
  "type": "card",
  "id": "customer_summary",
  "className": "col-span-12 lg:col-span-4",
  "title": "Customer Summary",
  "hidden": "${data.userRole !== 'admin'}",
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Active users: ${data.metrics.activeUsers}"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Every key belongs on the node itself — never in a `props` envelope.** The
renderers read `schema.title` / `schema.content` / `schema.columns` directly;
`SchemaRenderer` spreads `schema.props` as React props instead of merging it
into the node, so a key parked under `props` is never read and the component
paints an empty frame (the envelope itself also lands in the DOM as
`props="[object Object]"`). Namespaced `element:*` components are where `props`
is read by design (`readProps` in
`packages/components/src/renderers/basic/elements.tsx`).

`properties` is a different envelope with a different fate: `SchemaRenderer`
evaluates it and then **hoists its keys onto the node**, so unlike `props` it
does reach every renderer. That is why it is the only spelling that gets a
provider expression into a `data-table` today — measured, with the failing legs
and the reason it is recorded rather than recommended, in
[`rules/protocol.md`](../rules/protocol.md).

Prefer expression-based behavior (`hidden`, `disabled`) over imperative
branching in component code.

### 3b. Pick the right layout primitive

These are the structural types to reach for. By volume in the schema
catalogue, `flex`, `stack` and `box` are the three most-used layout nodes, so
reach for them before anything heavier. All take `children` and read every key
off the node.

| `type` | Renders | Key props (renderer defaults) | Reach for it when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `flex` | a flex row | `direction` (`row`), `justify` (`start`), `align` (`start`), `gap` (`2`), `wrap` (`false`) | items sit side by side: a toolbar, a header with actions pushed right (`justify: "between"`) |
| `stack` | a flex column | same props; `direction` defaults to `col` and `align` to `stretch` | items sit one under another: a form, a sidebar, a page body |
| `grid` | a CSS grid | `columns` (number, or a breakpoint object), `gap` (`4`) | a fixed number of equal cells that must reflow by breakpoint — KPI cards, a tile wall |
| `container` | a centred, width-capped block | `maxWidth` (`xl`; `false` cancels the cap), `centered` (`true`), `padding` (`4`) | you want page gutters and a reading width, once, near the root |
| `box` | a bare `div` | none — `className` passes through **verbatim**, and the renderer injects nothing | you want a wrapper that adds no layout of its own: a Tailwind-only block, a positioning anchor |
| `section` | a semantic `<section>` | none — `className` passes through **verbatim**, exactly like `box` | you want `box` with an outline landmark: a thematic grouping that carries its own heading |

Use whichever of `flex` / `stack` names your intent; do not set
`direction: "col"` on a `flex`.

`box` and `section` exist because every other option injects layout — the props
column above, plus `card`'s border, shadow and `CardContent` wrapper. When you
want none of that, those two are the ones that give you none of it.

### 4. Wire renderer and registry cleanly

Typical integration sequence:

1. Register default renderers/components.
2. Register plugin components needed by the page type.
3. Provide `dataSource` and contextual data through renderer provider.
4. Render schema via `SchemaRenderer`.

Keep custom component registrations namespaced to avoid collisions.

### 5. Use action data, not inline callback spaghetti

Represent interactions as data where possible:

<!-- os:check -->
```json
{
  "events": {
    "onClick": [
      { "action": "validate", "target": "customer_form" },
      { "action": "submit", "target": "customer_form" },
      { "action": "navigate", "params": { "url": "/customers" } }
    ]
  }
}
```

If custom app-side handlers are needed, isolate them in action handlers instead of embedding business logic into presentation components.

### 6. Validate responsiveness and accessibility

For every generated page, ensure:

- Responsive layout behavior (mobile/tablet/desktop).
- Semantic labels and ARIA fields where relevant.
- Keyboard-safe interactions for forms and actions.
- Error and loading states are present in schema or wrappers.

### 7. Ship with verification artifacts

Always include:

- Final page schema JSON.
- Integration code snippet (provider + renderer + registry wiring).
- Test checklist (rendering, expressions, actions, data loading).
- Optional migration notes if replacing legacy React page code.

## Output format

Always structure results in this order:

1. `Page Goal` - one paragraph.
2. `Schema JSON` - complete runnable draft.
3. `Integration Steps` - app wiring steps.
4. `Code Snippets` - minimal required TS/TSX examples.
5. `Validation Checklist` - what to test before merge.
6. `Extension Options` - how to add fields/plugins/actions next.

## Console-inspired patterns to reuse

When users ask for a "console-like" experience, prefer:

- App-shell layout with persistent navigation.
- Metadata-driven detail pages composed from widgets.
- Registry-based component resolution over switch/case rendering.
- PageSchema factories for page variants of the same domain entity.

## Expression evaluation boundaries

A key must clear **two independent gates** to reach the screen: the renderer has
to *read* it, and `SchemaRenderer` has to *evaluate* it. Both lists -- what is
evaluated, what is read raw, and what `props` / `properties` each do -- are in
[`rules/protocol.md`](../rules/protocol.md). Two consequences shape almost every
page:

**A `statistic` carries its own text keys**, so both static values and
expressions work on the node (`statistic` declares `label` / `value` /
`description`):
<!-- os:check -->
```json
{
  "type": "statistic",
  "label": "Active Users",
  "value": "${data.metrics.activeUsers}",
  "description": "+5% from last month",
  "trend": "up"
}
```

**A type that does not declare the key needs a `text` child**, because `content`
is evaluated on every component type:
<!-- os:check -->
```json
{
  "type": "card",
  "title": "Active Users",
  "children": [
    { "type": "text", "content": "${data.metrics.activeUsers} active, +${data.metrics.growth}% this month" }
  ]
}
```

Never reach for `props` to make an expression work: it is evaluated there and
then dropped, so the trade is a literal `${...}` on screen for nothing on
screen. Full syntax -- operators, formula functions, the security model -- is
[`guides/schema-expressions.md`](./schema-expressions.md).

## Stylesheets

A page renders unstyled unless the app imports
`@object-ui/components/style.css` then `@object-ui/fields/style.css`, in that
order. Both cases -- installed from npm, and linked inside the ObjectUI
workspace -- are in [`rules/styling.md`](../rules/styling.md); this guide keeps
no second copy.

## Plugin integration in page schemas

When pages need heavy widgets (grids, forms, kanbans, charts), import the plugin package and ensure its components are registered before rendering. Plugin
widgets read their configuration off the node exactly like the built-in
renderers do (`schema.objectName`, `schema.columns`, `schema.fields`,
`schema.gantt`) — the `props` envelope is not read here either.

**Grid plugin example:**
<!-- os:check -->
```json
{
  "type": "object-grid",
  "objectName": "products",
  "columns": [
    { "field": "name", "label": "Name", "type": "text" },
    { "field": "price", "label": "Price", "type": "currency" },
    { "field": "status", "label": "Status", "type": "select" }
  ],
  "bind": "products"
}
```

> **Grid columns key off `field`; form fields key off `name`.** The two layers sit
> next to each other here and use the same pair of words for opposite things:
> `ListColumn.field` names the object field a column shows, while `FormField.name`
> names the field a form input writes. A grid column written as `{ "name": ... }`
> names no field, so `ObjectGrid` drops it.

**Form plugin example:**
<!-- os:check -->
```json
{
  "type": "object-form",
  "objectName": "customer",
  "mode": "edit",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "name", "label": "Name", "type": "text", "required": true },
    { "name": "email", "label": "Email", "type": "text" }
  ]
}
```

**Kanban plugin example:**
<!-- os:check -->
```json
{
  "type": "object-kanban",
  "objectName": "tasks",
  "groupBy": "status",
  "bind": "tasks"
}
```

**Gantt plugin example:**
<!-- os:check -->
```json
{
  "type": "object-gantt",
  "objectName": "project_task",
  "gantt": {
    "titleField": "name",
    "startDateField": "start_date",
    "endDateField": "end_date"
  }
}
```

Those three `gantt` keys are the required ones; every other option — the tree,
dependency, baseline, resource-view, quick-filter, working-calendar and
read-only surfaces — is optional and documented in
[`@object-ui/plugin-gantt`'s README](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectui/blob/main/packages/plugin-gantt/README.md).
The same configuration can also be written as flat `startDateField` /
`endDateField` / ... keys **on the node** — never under `props`, which no
`ui:*` renderer reads. That flat spelling is the internal ObjectView / ListView
flatten product: it is taken only when there is no `gantt` block, and a node
carrying both renders the block and warns about the ignored top-level keys.
Author the `gantt` block.

Import plugins in your app entry point to trigger registration:
<!-- os:check -->
```typescript
import '@object-ui/plugin-grid';
import '@object-ui/plugin-form';
import '@object-ui/plugin-kanban';
```

### Full plugin catalog

Pick plugins by domain — each registers its own `type` strings in the ComponentRegistry on import:

| Domain | Plugins |
|--------|---------|
| Tables | `plugin-grid` |
| List / Detail / Form | `plugin-list`, `plugin-detail`, `plugin-form` |
| Time-based | `plugin-calendar`, `plugin-timeline`, `plugin-gantt` |
| Boards / Dashboards | `plugin-kanban`, `plugin-dashboard`, `plugin-report` |
| Visualization | `plugin-charts`, `plugin-map` |
| Editors | `plugin-editor`, `plugin-markdown` |
| Views & Design | `plugin-view`, `plugin-tree`, `plugin-designer` |
| AI | `plugin-ai`, `plugin-chatbot` |

For lazy loading, use `LazyPluginLoader` from `@object-ui/react` rather than top-level imports.

### Shell integration

For host apps that need more than the raw renderer, prefer `@object-ui/app-shell`:

<!-- os:check -->
```tsx
import { AppShell, ObjectView, PageView, DashboardView } from '@object-ui/app-shell';
```

It exposes `ObjectView`, `RecordDetailView`, `PageView`, `DashboardView`,
`ReportView` and matching providers (`AdapterProvider`, `MetadataProvider`,
`ExpressionProvider`). ⚠️ Not `ObjectRenderer` / `PageRenderer` /
`DashboardRenderer`. `ObjectRenderer` exists nowhere in the repo;
`DashboardRenderer` is a public export of `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard`; and
`PageRenderer` is an internal renderer inside `@object-ui/components`,
reachable only through the `page` / `app` / `utility` / `home` / `record`
registry keys it registers, never as an import. See
`guides/project-setup.md` for the decision matrix.
