/**
 * objectui#7299 — the parent-relationship condition is compiled to match the
 * relationship field's ARITY.
 *
 * `RelatedList` composed `{ [referenceField]: parentId }` unconditionally. When
 * the child object declares that field `multiple: true` — `Field.user({
 * multiple: true })` is the platform's own shape for "one assignment names N
 * people" — the stored value is an ARRAY of ids, which the drivers persist as a
 * JSON-valued column. `=` on that column compares the whole serialized array
 * against a single value and can never equal one member. `driver-sql` says so,
 * by field name, and refuses:
 *
 *   400 INVALID_FILTER
 *   The bare equality spelling { "assignees": value } WAS NOT APPLIED:
 *   "assignees" is a multi-value (or otherwise JSON-valued) field … Use
 *   "$contains" for membership ({ "assignees": { "$contains": "a" } })
 *
 * The driver is not the defect and neither is the metadata: `relationshipField`
 * is a public, authorable key and the author named a legal, supported field
 * type. The renderer compiled it into a predicate the storage cannot answer.
 * So this card restores declared = enforced, and it widens no authoring
 * surface — there is no `relationshipOperator`, because the author is naming a
 * RELATIONSHIP and its storage form is the component's business.
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and why it is not "`$contains` appears somewhere"
 *
 * The acceptance is a CLASS predicate: a related list on a multi-valued
 * relationship field returns data, and single-valued behaviour is unchanged.
 * So the first describe below reads ROWS ON SCREEN through a fake backend that
 * EVALUATES the composed filter, rather than comparing `$filter` to a literal.
 * A spelling assertion cannot tell "asks the right question" from "asks a
 * question that happens to be spelled the way I typed in the expectation".
 *
 * ## Why the evaluator REFUSES bare equality instead of answering `false`
 *
 * Because that is what was measured against the live driver, and the difference
 * is the whole card. An evaluator that quietly answers "no rows" for `=` on an
 * array would make this file pass for a component that had merely stopped
 * fetching. Refusing reproduces the observable defect — a section that renders
 * an error — and it is also the one bug that would make this file lie in the
 * other direction: an evaluator permissive about shapes it does not recognise
 * answers "all rows" for anything, which the assertions below would read as a
 * pass. So `evaluate` throws on every shape it was not written for.
 *
 * ## Where the verdict comes from
 *
 * The arity VERDICT is `@objectstack/spec/data`'s exported `isMultiValueField`,
 * imported rather than re-implemented — the component only finds the field def
 * to hand it. That is not hygiene: a second copy of the rule inside this
 * package would be two readers of one question disagreeing, which is the defect
 * this card is about. The three `SPEC PREDICATE` cases below pin the places
 * where the spec's rule and an eyeballed `multiple === true` DIFFER, measured
 * on `@objectstack/spec` 17.4.0, in both directions.
 *
 * ⚠️ This header used to add that "the driver that refuses the query picks on
 * the spec's". It does NOT (objectui#8937). `driver-sql` gates the equality
 * family on its own STORAGE question — a JSON column when the type is one it
 * stores as JSON OR when `multiple` is merely TRUTHY, on ANY type — so the two
 * rules diverge for a type outside `MULTI_CAPABLE_TYPES` carrying
 * `multiple: true`. See the `INERT` case below and `parentRelationshipFieldDef`'s
 * docblock in `RelatedList.tsx`; the divergence itself is re-derived each run by
 * `relatedListParentScopeResidue-8937.test.ts` and owned upstream by
 * objectstack#17469.
 *
 * ## The control
 *
 * `SINGLE_VALUED` runs the same page against the same evaluator with a scalar
 * FK. It is green BEFORE and AFTER the fix — that is what makes it a control
 * rather than a second subject: it can only redden if the normal path breaks,
 * never merely because the multi-value path is broken.
