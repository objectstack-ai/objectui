/**
 * The generic condition mount offers the subjects ITS OWN metadata type's
 * evaluator binds — objectui#9953, the polymorphic mount the two curated ones
 * could not be copied onto.
 *
 * ## The defect these cases reproduce
 *
 * `CONDITION_SCOPE_BY_METADATA_TYPE` rules `action`, `hook` and `validation`
 * all `'record'`, and all three verdicts are right — every one of those
 * evaluators binds the row as the `record` ROOT. But that table answers how a
 * predicate is LINTED, and the hosts disagree about something it does not
 * carry: what they BIND. A hook's condition and a validation rule's guard are
 * evaluated on the SERVER against `record` and `previous` alone; an action's
 * `visible` is evaluated in the BROWSER, where `user` really is bound.
 *
 * So the one-line `subjects={{ context: RECORD_CONDITION_SUBJECTS }}` the two
 * curated inspectors took could not be copied here a third time: at this mount
 * it would be right for a hook and would take a working subject away from an
 * action. `RECORD_CONDITION_SUBJECTS` states the same refusal from the
 * component's side — it is declared by a mount, never derived from
 * `scope === 'record'`. `conditionSubjectsForMetadataType` is the missing half:
 * the per-type derivation that lets one mount answer for many hosts.
 *
 * ## Reachability is MEASURED here, not assumed
 *
 * The card left it open whether a server-evaluated condition reaches this
 * generic mount at all, since `HookDefaultInspector` hides `condition` from its
 * own fallback form. It does reach it, by the route the first case takes:
 * `hook` has no registered preview, so `ResourceEditPage` renders its plain
 * branch — the whole-draft `SchemaForm` carrying the derived `WidgetContext` —
 * and the curated inspector, which lives on the canvas branch, never runs. That
 * case mounts the real host so the route is re-measured on every run rather
 * than recorded in this paragraph.
 *
 * ## Derived, not retyped
 *
 * The narrowed list is never spelled out here. Each case reads what the default
 * vocabulary actually renders, then asserts about ROOTS against
 * `RECORD_CONDITION_ROOTS` — the binding set the server hosts were measured to
 * have. A subject added to the default list reddens these cases if the hook
 * mount starts offering it, and the client-tier case reddens if a narrowing
 * ever reaches the mounts that legitimately bind `user`.
