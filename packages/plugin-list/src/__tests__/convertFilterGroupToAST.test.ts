 * carries, and the exact node it must produce. Measured against the code this
 * fixes, four of the six emitted `[]` — "no filter":
 *
 *   isEmpty    -> ["name","=",null]      isNull     -> []   ← the defect
 *   isNotEmpty -> ["name","!=",null]     isNotNull  -> []   ← the defect

 *
 * It is a table over the SET rather than a list of four cases on purpose: the
 * totality check below fails if a new value-less operator appears upstream and
 * nobody comes here to say what the live grid emits for it. That is the same
 * silence this bug lived in — the set grew from two to six over three issues
 * and this function was never told.
