/**
 * objectui#9108 - a node-gate predicate parked under `props` is REFUSED BY
 * NAME, loudly: not honoured, and not silently dropped.
 *
 * ## What was measured, and why it could not be seen
 *
 * A node may spell its config bag `properties` (the spec spelling) or `props`
 * (the annotated legacy alias). `SchemaRenderer`'s hoist copies `properties.*`
 * onto the node; nothing copies `props.*`. Both node gates read the post-hoist
 * node, so a predicate authored under the alias was never one of the keys
 * either gate could see:
 *
 * | authored                         | observed           |
 * |----------------------------------|--------------------|
 * | `props: { visible: false }`      | the node RENDERED  |
 * | `props: { hidden: true }`        | the node RENDERED  |
 * | `properties: { visible: false }` | correctly hidden   |
 * | `properties: { hidden: true }`   | correctly hidden   |
 *
 * Fail-OPEN and silent: a gate that never bit renders exactly like a gate that
 * said yes, so no user and no screenshot can find it.
 *
 * ## Which half of that this suite pins
 *
 * BOTH, and they are not the same assertion. The ruling of 2026-09-13 closed
 * the honour arm (PR objectui#9144) and ruled REFUSE, so:
 *
 *   - the VERDICT rows below must read exactly as the defect table above - the
 *     alias still gates nothing. A suite that only pinned the console line
 *     would go green on a tree that had quietly started honouring the alias,
 *     which is the arm the maintainer refused;
 *   - the REFUSAL rows must name the key on the console. A suite that only
 *     pinned the verdicts would go green on today's silence, which is the
 *     defect.
 *
 * ## Both polarities, one harness, in one file
 *
 * Every verdict row is measured in BOTH directions - a truthy predicate and a
 * falsy one - through the same probe in the same suite. A pair of EQUAL
 * verdicts is the signature of a gate that was never consulted, whichever way
 * it landed, and that pair is exactly what the `props` rows must still produce.
 * The `properties` rows are the live control: "the node is hidden" is equally
 * satisfied by a renderer that hides everything, by a broken registry, and by a
 * probe that never mounted, so the control has to run here rather than be
 * asserted elsewhere.
 *
 * ## Plain booleans on purpose
 *
 * objectui#9100 and objectui#9107 are about a CEL envelope being flattened on
 * the way to the engine. This defect is present with a plain boolean and no
 * expression anywhere, and it predates both repairs, so nothing here carries an
 * envelope: an envelope would make a failure ambiguous between the two causes.
