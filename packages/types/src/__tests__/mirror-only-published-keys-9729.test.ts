/**
 * The two LOCAL mirrored-but-undeclared keys, measured per key (objectui#9729).
 *
 * ## What this file is, and ⛔ what it is not
 *
 * `MirroredUndeclared` in `zod-mirror-parity.test.ts` measures the DIRECTION —
 * a key the zod mirror states and the TypeScript twin does not — and reconciles
 * it per pair. It deliberately says nothing about what each key DOES, because
 * the remedy is a contract decision: declaring the key on the twin ENLARGES the
 * published TypeScript accept set, narrowing the mirror SHRINKS the published
 * validator's, and both move a face `@object-ui/types` already ships.
 *
 * ⛔ This file did not pick either direction, and it is ⛔ not a repair. It is
 * the per-key CONSEQUENCE the ledger's one-line entries cannot carry, recorded
 * so the at-tier contract review can read it instead of re-deriving it. Every
 * assertion below is a statement about `origin/main` as it stands; whichever
 * direction the review rules, the entries here move with it.
 *
 * ⭐ BOTH KEYS HAVE NOW BEEN RULED, and this file moved with each of them exactly
 * as the paragraph above promised — in OPPOSITE directions, which is the thing to
 * read here before assuming one ruling generalises to the other.
 *
 *   - `operators` — objectui#9739 (maintainer, 2026-09-18) took letter C:
 *     removed from the published mirror, a tombstone left in its place that
 *     refuses the key by name and names the spelling the upstream protocol
 *     declares. So the `operators` section below no longer pins a SILENT
 *     ACCEPTANCE — it pins the LOUD REFUSAL that replaced it, and the lit
 *     control beside it is what keeps the assertion honest in its new
 *     direction. The full per-half measurement, including the upstream
 *     re-derivation of the spelling the message names, lives in
 *     `object-grid-operators-tombstone-9739.test.ts`.
 *   - `dueLike` — objectui#9738 (maintainer, 2026-09-18) took letter A: the
 *     key is DECLARED on the published TypeScript twin, so the validator, the
 *     type checker, the renderer and the docs now say the same thing. The
 *     mirror is ⛔ untouched — it already stated the key — so the section below
 *     that measures the mirror is unchanged, and it is the TypeScript half at
 *     the bottom of this file that inverted.
 *
 * What stays, in both cases, is the BEFORE/AFTER continuity, so neither defect
 * this card measured can quietly return under the same name.
 *
 * ## The two keys do NOT behave the same way, and the difference is the ruling
 *
 * Both twins are hand-written interfaces, but only one of them can REFUSE:
 *
 *   - `DetailViewField` carried no index signature, so TypeScript rejected an
 *     authored `dueLike` outright (`TS2353`). The two published faces therefore
 *     actively CONTRADICTED each other: the validator judged the key and kept
 *     it, the compiler refused the same document. ⭐ That was the loud defect,
 *     and it was ruled letter A (objectui#9738): the twin DECLARES the key now,
 *     so the accept set of the published TypeScript face widened by exactly one
 *     key and the contradiction is closed in the direction that keeps the
 *     renderer's behaviour. It still carries no index signature — which is what
 *     keeps the assignment at the bottom of this file a real assertion.
 *   - `ObjectGridSchema` extends `BaseSchema`, whose `[key: string]: any` index
 *     signature absorbs any unstated key. TypeScript neither declares nor
 *     refuses `operators`; it types it `any`. The faces did not contradict —
 *     one was simply silent, which is a weaker defect and was a different
 *     decision. ⭐ It was decided (objectui#9739, letter C): the MIRROR now
 *     refuses the key by name and prints the upstream spelling, while the twin
 *     is deliberately left alone — so the two faces still do not contradict,
 *     but the silent one is no longer the only one an author hears from.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The third key the ledger groups with these two is NOT this defect
 *
 * `complex.zod.ts#DashboardConfigSchema`'s `aria` is a `z.never()` retirement
 * tombstone: it REFUSES the key by name and prints a remedy. Its consequence is
 * the OPPOSITE of the two above — they admit silently, it rejects loudly — so a
 * sweep that treats the three alike would ask a maintainer to repair something
 * already doing its job. Pinned here as the CONTRAST, by re-deriving its shape
 * rather than by citing the reading.
 *
 * ## Every zero below carries a lit control on the same instrument
 *
 * A green `safeParse` proves nothing on its own: both mirrors accept unknown
 * keys (one strips them, the other keeps them unexamined). What distinguishes a
 * MIRRORED key from an unknown one is that the mirror JUDGES it — so each key's
 * pin is paired with an unrecognised-key control parsed through the same schema.
