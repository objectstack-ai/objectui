 *
 * objectui#9550 - `ObjectTreeSchema` is nameable on the ROOT barrel of
 * `@object-ui/types`.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `ObjectTreeSchema` is a declared node schema that an author could not import
 * from `@object-ui/types`. Its eleven sibling arms of
 * `ObjectQLComponentSchema` could be. Historical reading, taken once on
 * `origin/main` `72f55c9ec1` before this repair and deliberately not restated
 * as a live figure - the assertions below are what re-derive the claim:
 *
 *   | name                        | hits in the root barrel source |
 *   | --------------------------- | -----------------------------: |
 *   | `ObjectTreeSchema`          |                              0 |
 *   | `ObjectGridSchema` (control)|                              2 |
 *   | `ListViewSchema`   (control)|                              3 |
 *   | `BreadcrumbSchema` (control)|                              1 |
 *
 * Three controls read non-zero under the same query, so the zero was a reading
 * and not a dark instrument. `ObjectTreeSchema` was and is declared in
 * `objectql.ts` and re-exported by the zod barrel (objectui#7917 repaired that
 * half, objectui#8784 keeps it repaired); only the TypeScript barrel omitted
 * it, and this package publishes NO `./objectql` subpath to reach around the
 * barrel - its `exports` map declares `.`, `./base`, `./complex`, `./data`,
 * `./data-display`, `./feedback`, `./form`,
 * `./internal/retired-field-keys`, `./layout`, `./navigation`, `./overlay` and
 * `./zod`. The root barrel was the only route, and it did not carry the name.
 *
 * ## The measured consequence, which is the natural "before" of leg (a2)
 *
 * The seat delivering objectui#8655 needed this type to stop
 * `ObjectTreeProps.schema` being `any`. Because the name could not be
 * imported, it had to spell the node as
 * `Extract<ObjectQLComponentSchema, { type: 'object-tree' }>`. That idiom is
 * correct and it still is; what it is not is discoverable. So leg (a2) asserts
 * the imported name and that Extract are the SAME type - a barrel line that
 * published a fork of the name would satisfy leg (a1) and still leave the
 * reader with two things to reconcile.
 *
 * ## Why a SOURCE scan sits next to the type-level pins
 *
 * The type-level pins are erased by the compiler, so they say nothing during
 * `pnpm test`; their enforcement is `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`, the third leg
 * of this package's `type-check` script, which CI runs as its own job. The
 * source scan is the half that runs under `vitest`, and it is deliberately NOT
 * a `dist/` read: this repo's per-PR `test` job runs `pnpm test` with no build
 * step ahead of it (turbo's `test` task depends on `^build`, the DEPENDENCY
 * closure, never the package's own build), so a test needing a fresh `dist/`
 * would be vacuously absent-or-red on a cold cache.
 * `package-exports-manifest.test.ts` and
 * `combobox-option-root-barrel-7697.test.ts` record that same constraint for
 * the same package; this file follows them rather than re-litigating it.
 *
 * ## What this file is NOT
 *
 * It is a PER-NAME pin, not a barrel-completeness gate. The card that ordered
 * this repair offered such a gate as its option 3 and it was ruled out for
 * this change: a gate over "every declared node schema is reachable from the
 * barrel that publishes its family" is a wider design with its own review, and
 * it would arrive here unrequested. objectui#9526 is the sibling card in the
 * same family. If that gate is ever built, this file becomes one of its
 * regression cases rather than its substitute.
