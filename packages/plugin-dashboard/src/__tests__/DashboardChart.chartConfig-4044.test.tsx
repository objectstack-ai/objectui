 * objectui#4044 — `DashboardWidget.chartConfig` on the INLINE dashboard chart
 * relays, pinned at the seam.
 *
 * ## What was measured on `origin/main` before this file
 *
 * `chartConfig` is declared as the spec's full `ChartConfigSchema` on every
 * dashboard widget (`dashboard.zod.ts`: `chartConfig: ChartConfigSchema`), and
 * the maintainer's ruling on this card is that the implementation follows the
 * protocol. The ADR-0021 dataset path already did (objectstack#7016,
 * `DatasetWidget.chartConfig.test.tsx`). The two INLINE relays did not:
 * `DashboardRenderer.tsx` contained the string `chartConfig` **0** times
 * (lit control in the same sweep: `widget`, 173 times) and
 * `DashboardGridLayout.tsx` the same. So an author who bound a widget to
 * inline rows or to a `provider: 'object'` aggregate — neither of which is a
 * dataset — and wrote `chartConfig.title` / `.colors` / `.height` parsed clean
 * and got nothing on screen.
 *
 * ## Why the seam, and where the DRAWN half lives
 *
 * A seam assertion cannot tell a honoured prop from an ignored one, so it is
 * never the whole pin. It is the right place for THIS half because the decision
 * under test is what the relay COMPOSES, and that decision is spelled twice —
 * `DashboardRenderer` and `DashboardGridLayout` each build their own chart node
 * (the same duality `DashboardChart.categoryAxisKey-8269.test.tsx` pins, whose
 * recorder harness this file reuses). The drawn half is pinned in two places:
 *
 *  - `DashboardChart.chartConfigDom-4044.test.tsx` beside this file renders the
 *    REAL chain for the keys that paint outside Recharts' `ResponsiveContainer`
 *    (`title`, `subtitle`, `description`, `height`);
 *  - `DashboardChart.chartConfigMarks-4044.test.tsx`, also beside this file,
 *    renders the same real chain for the keys that paint INSIDE it (`colors`
 *    and its `categoryColors` arm, `showDataLabels`, `annotations`,
 *    `interaction`, `showLegend`), by sizing the `ResponsiveContainer` element.
 *
 * Both of those are on the dashboard surface, which is what the ruling asks
 * for. `plugin-charts/src/ChartRenderer.dashboardChartConfig.test.tsx` also
 * draws these keys, but it hand-builds its schema: measured, it stays entirely
 * GREEN when both relays stop forwarding, so it pins the CHART BLOCK and never
 * this seam.
 *
 * ## The keys deliberately NOT here
 *
 *  - `type` — the widget's own `type` already picks the chart family on this
 *    path; an authored one would shadow the dispatch.
 *  - `xAxis` / `yAxis` / `series` — whether an authored axis beats the
 *    ADR-0021 dataset derivation is an open PROTOCOL question, filed for the
 *    spec seat as objectstack#17385. The whitelist emits none of the three, and
 *    the refusal block below pins that, so this change cannot pre-empt it.
 *  - `aria` — declared by the spec and read by NOTHING on this path (measured;
 *    see the refusal block). Forwarding it would move declared-but-not-delivered
 *    one layer down, which is the failure this card exists to remove.
