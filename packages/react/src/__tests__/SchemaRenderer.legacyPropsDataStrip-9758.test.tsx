 * objectui#9758 — the objectui#9571 `data` strip reaches the LEGACY `props`
 * alias bag too.
 *
 * ## The carrier this closes
 *
 * objectui#9571 removed the authored `data` key from `componentProps` — the
 * node's own non-metadata keys — on a block whose published `data` row is the
 * `ViewData` OBJECT arm. But `createElement` spreads the legacy `props` alias
 * bag AFTER that strip, so an author who spelled the same key
 * `props: { data: [...] }` still took the prop seat, and `ObjectGrid`
 * (`passedData`), `ObjectMap` (`dataProp`) and `ObjectGantt` still lifted it
 * with an unconditional `Array.isArray` at higher priority than the shared
 * ladder. Same defect, one alias over.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling, decision batch #167 item 2, letter 剥, 「其他同意」: the
 * strip applies to the alias bag as well — the same arm predicate, the same dev
 * diagnostic. ⛔ No validator refusal (whether the alias exists at all is
 * objectui#4795's pending question ②, human-held), and ⛔ no change to what the
 * alias otherwise carries.
 *
 * ## The probe keeps all three arms, and that is what makes it a reading
 *
 * Row 1 drives all three spellings of the same key through ONE instrument:
 * top-level `data`, canonical `properties: { data }`, legacy `props: { data }`.
 * The first two are the same-subject controls — they were already absent before
 * this card, so a probe that reported the third as absent while silently
 * breaking would read identically to a broken probe. All three are asserted in
 * one object so a failure names WHICH spelling moved.
 *
 * ## Why a stub and not a real block
 *
 * The question this file owns is what `SchemaRenderer` HANDS OVER. A real grid
 * answers a different one (did rows appear) through a fetch effect, an adapter
 * and a dozen unrelated decisions; the plugin packages own that half. The real
 * plugins are not importable here in any case — they depend on this package.
