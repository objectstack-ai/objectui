/**
 * objectui#8958 — ONE authored `dueLike`, one overdue affordance, across the
 * two neighbouring date cell renderers.
 *
 * ## The declared contract
 *
 * `DetailViewFieldSchema.dueLike` (`@object-ui/types`' zod views) says, in the
 * `describe` text an author reads: "Marks a date/datetime field as
 * due/deadline-semantic, gating the relative 'Overdue Nd' wording (vs. neutral
 * 'Nd ago' for start/end/created dates)". Both types. `DateTimeCellRenderer`
 * never read the key.
 *
 * ## What was measured, before anything was changed
 *
 * Clock pinned to `2026-09-09T12:00:00.000Z`, `TZ=UTC` (root vitest config),
 * `en-US`, value `2026-09-06T09:30:00.000Z` (3 days past, inside the ±7-day
 * relative window), through the two cell renderers:
 *
 *   date     `dueLike: true` -> "Overdue 3d"  `tabular-nums text-red-600`
 *   datetime `dueLike: true` -> "3 days ago"  `tabular-nums text-sm whitespace-nowrap`
 *   datetime  no key at all  -> "3 days ago"  `tabular-nums text-sm whitespace-nowrap`
 *
 * Rows 2 and 3 were BYTE-IDENTICAL: the authored key changed nothing. That is
 * the silent-drop signature — the runtime accepts the key, parses it, drops
 * it, and renders something that still looks like a legitimate relative date,
 * so a reader cannot tell an honoured `dueLike` from a dropped one by looking
 * at the cell. A green suite therefore proves nothing by itself, and every
 * case below asserts a rendered FACE.
 *
 * ## The oracle is AGREEMENT, not a string
 *
 * The finding is the DISAGREEMENT between the two types, so the assertion is
 * `datetimeFace === dateFace` — anchored to the literal face as well, so a
 * redesign that moved both sides together cannot pass. A one-sided
 * reproduction could not distinguish "datetime drops it" from "nothing paints
 * overdue anywhere".
 *
 * ## Controls, and why each one is here
 *
 * - **A `datetime` WITHOUT `dueLike` renders exactly as before** — the
 *   population that must not move. Without it, "every datetime now says
 *   Overdue" passes every other case in this file.
 * - **A `dueLike` datetime that is NOT overdue** (future, and today) paints no
 *   affordance and stays byte-identical to the no-key face. Same reason.
 * - **The `date` cell, same run, same instant** — it already honoured the key,
 *   so it is what "honoured" looks like; without it an assertion here could be
 *   measuring a broken clock or a dead locale channel.
 *
 * ## The granularity is INHERITED, and is pinned as such
 *
 * `formatRelativeDate` compares calendar-day boundaries and gates its wording
 * on `diffDays < -1`, so **"Overdue 0d" is not a string this codebase can
 * produce** — the shortest overdue phrase is "Overdue 2d". Measured, because
 * it is the whole reason honouring the declaration is coherent at datetime
 * precision rather than nonsense: a datetime two hours past its deadline reads
 * "Today", exactly as the `date` cell has always answered for a deadline
 * falling today. Sub-day precision is a separate call and was not taken here.
 *
 * ## Directions
 *
 * Reverting the `dueLike` read in `DateTimeCellRenderer` turns the repro, the
 * styling cases, the heuristic case and the i18n case RED, and leaves every
 * control GREEN — the controls measure surfaces this change does not touch,
 * which is exactly why they can vouch for the run. Gating the red styling on
 * the relative branch alone turns the compact-face case RED. Making the cell
 * time-of-day aware turns the day-granularity cases RED.
