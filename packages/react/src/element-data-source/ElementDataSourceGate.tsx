 *
 * Mapping half of consuming `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` — the spec's
 * `ElementDataSourceSchema` per-element data binding (objectstack#5576 landed
 * the resolution; objectstack#6953 wires it to the remaining blocks).
 *
 * `@object-ui/core` owns the pure half (telling the binding apart from a runtime
 * adapter, matching a view name, composing the view with the binding's own
 * keys). {@link useElementDataSource} owns the fetch half. This module owns the
 * LAST hop: writing the composed result onto the schema keys a given block
 * actually reads, and rendering the two non-final states.
 *
 * It exists because that hop was the part every block would otherwise copy.
 * `dataSource` is declared on EVERY page component, so eight blocks need the
 * same precedence table (below) with only the KEY NAMES differing — which is a
 * mapping description, not eight algorithms. A per-block copy is how the two
 * halves drift: one block ANDs the filters and the next replaces them, and the
 * spec's "additional filter criteria" quietly becomes two dialects.
 *
 * `plugin-list`'s `ListViewBlock` carried the ORIGINAL copy of the table
 * (objectstack#5576, which predates this module) and was collapsed onto this one
 * by objectui#4038 — on the acceptance criterion that objectstack#5576's whole
 * suite passes against this implementation untouched, which it does. Every
 * object-bound block now reads the rules below from here, so this is the one
 * place a change to them belongs.
 *
 * ## Precedence — one table, applied everywhere
 *
 * Three kinds of value arrive and they do not have the same standing:
 *
 *  - **`dataSource.*` keys are authoritative.** The author wrote them on THIS
 *    placement and the spec says the binding "overrides page-level object
 *    context", so they beat the component's own same-named key.
 *  - **View-sourced values are a baseline.** A `view` is a *reference*; a key
 *    written on the component itself is more specific than the view it points
 *    at, so the component's key wins over one the view supplied.
 *  - **`filter` never overrides — it combines.** The spec describes the
 *    binding's filter as "*Additional* filter criteria", so component filter,
 *    view filter and binding filter all AND together through
 *    {@link mergeFilterNodes}. A binding can only narrow what the view already
 *    restricts, never widen it: a mistyped per-element filter cannot expose rows
 *    the saved view excluded.
 *
 * An authored-but-EMPTY `columns` counts as "not authored": `[]` is what the
 * designer emits for an unconfigured column list, and supplying the columns is
 * exactly why a view was named.
 *
 * The row cap answers "did the component author one?" the same way, and for the
 * same reason (objectui#9899). A cap the contract REFUSES — `pageSize: 0`,
 * a negative, a fraction — is not a cap this relay may treat as the author's
 * intent, so it does not suppress the one the bound view supplies. Deciding
 * that question by PRESENCE is how a view's legitimate cap was dropped in
 * favour of the consuming renderer's own default: measured end to end on
 * `list-view` before the repair, a component carrying `pagination.pageSize: 0`
 * under a view supplying `7` put `$top: 100` on the wire — the view's cap never
 * reached it, so the read was WIDER than the view asked for.
 *
 * ## What a mapping may NOT do
 *
 * {@link ElementDataSourceMapping} names only keys the target block genuinely
 * reads. Writing a composed key onto a schema key the block ignores would
 * reproduce the very defect this wiring removes — a value accepted and dropped —
 * one layer further in, where it is even harder to see. A block with no row cap
 * therefore leaves `limit` unmapped rather than parking it somewhere plausible,
 * and the gap is recorded at the call site instead of being papered over here.
 *
 * ## A block with no ADAPTER fails loudly too (objectui#5378)
 *
 * The section below is about an unresolvable view NAME. The coarser failure —
 * no runtime adapter reached the block at all — used to render an empty shell
 * in exactly the same silence, and that is what `requiresDataSource` +
 * {@link NoDataSourcePanel} now report. Measured on the published
 * getting-started guide: all five of its blocks resolved no adapter, fetched
 * nothing, and said nothing. The two panels are deliberately the same shape;
 * they answer "which view?" and "which data source?", and an author who sees
 * either one is being told where to look.
 *
 * ## An unresolvable `view` fails loudly
 *
 * When the named view does not exist the gate renders a configuration error
 * instead of letting the block fall back to the object's default scope. Silently
 * widening a named view to "all records" is the failure class the binding exists
 * to remove, and it is the one an AI-authored page hides best: the page looks
 * like it works.

/**
 * The wrapping seam — mark `renderer` as one that wraps {@link

 *
 * ## What this closes
 *
 * `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` is the one spelling that resolves a saved
 * view for an object-bound block. It works — and because no registration
 * declared it, `sdui-parser`'s `validateTree` reported it with the SAME
 * `unknown-prop` warning it gives the spellings that do nothing. On the tier
 * built to accept AI-authored pages the diagnostic IS the contract, so the
 * tier's only signal pointed away from the one key that works.
 *
 * ## Why a seam and not nine declarations
 *
 * Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-29: option B **in the injection form**. Nine
 * hand-written copies across nine packages is the shape that ruling refused —
 * they drift, and the tenth block forgets. Passing through here is the only
 * thing a block does; `Registry.register` emits the declaration
 * (`withElementDataSourceInput`), and `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT` in
 * `@object-ui/core` is its single copy, beside the binding's own semantics.
 *
 * ## And it cannot be forgotten
 *
 * `scripts/check-element-data-source-declaration.mjs` fails any source that
 * renders `ElementDataSourceGate` for a registration without passing that
 * registration's renderer through this function. That is the mechanical half of
 * "a tenth block gets it automatically"; this function is the seam it enforces.
 *
 * Returns the renderer UNCHANGED (the mark is held in a `WeakSet`), so it is safe
 * over a `React.forwardRef` object, over `React.memo`, and over a component that
 * something else already re-exports by reference.
 *
 * ⚠️ Re-exported from `@object-ui/core` — where the marker and the declaration
 * live — rather than wrapped here: ONE function under ONE name. This export
 * exists for DISCOVERABILITY, so the seam is findable beside the gate it is
 * about; **call sites must import it from `@object-ui/core`**, and
 * `check:element-data-source-declaration` enforces that.
 *
 * The rule is measured, not stylistic. A registration runs at MODULE SCOPE, 101
 * suites in this repo partially mock `@object-ui/react` by hand-listing the
 * exports they return, and a module-scope read of a name absent from such a list
 * throws at COLLECTION time — the importing test file dies before running one
 * assertion. Taking the seam from here reddened 17 files across all four CI
 * shards with zero failed assertions among them. Nothing mocks `@object-ui/core`,
