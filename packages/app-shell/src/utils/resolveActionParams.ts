/**
 * resolveActionParams — Resolves field-backed action parameters against
 * runtime object metadata.
 *
 * Action params (`packages/spec/src/ui/action.zod.ts ActionParamSchema`) may
 * either be declared inline (`{ name, label, type, ... }`) or reference an
 * existing object field via `{ field, objectOverride? }`. Field-backed
 * params inherit label (i18n via `fieldLabel()`), type, options, placeholder,
 * and help text from the object's field definition. Inline properties on a
 * field-backed param act as overrides.
 *
 * NOT validation: this comment used to claim it, but no `validation` was ever
 * inherited — `RuntimeField` below has no such key to read one from, and the
 * `ActionParamDef` it would have landed on no longer declares one either
 * (objectui#3201). A param's constraints reach the widgets through
 * `paramToField()` as `required` / `minLength` / `maxLength` / `pattern`.
 *
 * The resolver flattens each param to the runtime `ActionParamDef` shape
 * expected by `ActionParamDialog`, so the dialog itself stays agnostic to
 * field references.
 *
 * AUTHORING vs RESOLVED is the load-bearing distinction here, and the two
 * vocabularies are not interchangeable (objectui#3174). What an author may
 * write is exactly the spec's `ActionParamSchema` key set — mirrored by
 * `@object-ui/types`' `ActionParam` and by {@link RawActionParam} below. What
 * this function EMITS is `@object-ui/core`'s `ActionParamDef`, whose picker
 * group (`referenceTo`, `displayField`, …) exists only after resolution.
 * Authoring a resolved-side key is a mistake in every direction — `tsc`
 * rejects it, the server's `.strict()` parse rejects it, and this resolver
 * names it via {@link RESOLVED_ONLY_PARAM_KEYS} rather than reading it.

        // objectui#7642 CENSUS — verdict KEEP. The in-file provenance note above is
        // CORRECT (`ctx.objects` is `useMetadata().objects`, the `/api/v1/meta/object`
        // documents), so this really is the object-schema def. It is still kept: the
        // serve path runs no parse, so retiring a snake read deletes the only read
        // of an authorable key. (That census sentence used to add "and none of the
        // four reads below has a camel leg" — objectui#7435 made that half false for
        // three of them; the KEEP verdict it supports is unchanged.)
        //
        // ⭐ objectui#7435 — the DECLARED spelling is ranked FIRST on the three
        // keys that have one. Every read here used to be snake-only, so the
        // camelCase values `getObjectSchema` serves were silently dropped and
        // the param rendered with picker defaults. The snake legs are KEPT
        // behind the declared one, in their pre-existing order: a per-site
        // producer sweep found no in-repo producer of them, but neither of the
        // two producers that can still emit them is covered by that sweep — a
        // document stored before the key was tightened (the serve path runs no
        // parse — objectui#7650) and a host adapter outside this repo. Dropping
        // a leg is a retirement with its own evidence, not a side effect here.
        //
        // ⛔ `idField` and `titleFormat` keep their snake-only reads on purpose
        // — see {@link RuntimeField}. Neither has a `FieldSchema` spelling to
        // rank first, so there is nothing to add that would not fossilise an
        // undeclared key. `lookupColumns` / `lookupPageSize` / `dependsOn` ARE
        // declared and DO still read snake-only; they are outside this card's
        // three-key scope and stay recorded on objectui#7435 rather than being
        // swept in silently.
