// The keys `@objectstack/spec`'s `object-tree` row declares, each published
// because `ObjectTree` was measured to honour it (objectui#11168 slice 3,
// objectui#11111 decision 3 = B). Every description names only what the
// renderer was measured to do with the key; the members of each structured key
// are pinned in `__tests__/objectTreeInputs-11168.test.tsx`, and a renderer
// that changes any of them reddens a row there — the fix is to rewrite the
// description with it.
//
// `objectName` is NOT required: the record source is one of `data`,
// `staticData` and `objectName`, read in that order, so a tree on inline rows
// never reads it. Required, the page validator raised `missing-required-prop`
// on a tree the spec row and the renderer both accept. The list is a flat
// declaration with a boolean `required`, so it states the rule in the
// description rather than growing a one-of form — the `object-map` /
// `object-gantt` precedent (objectui#7470).
//
// `view:tree` is the same renderer under a second tag, so it shares the list.
