/**
 * objectui#9653 — `KanbanStrayGroupByRefusal`'s message must not deny the
 * validation that emits it.
 *
 * The objectui#8365 message said a view carrying `groupBy` "never came through
 * the validated path", and a few clauses later that the key rode this mirror's
 * `.passthrough()` into `ListView` and changed the board. Only the second was
 * true: at the parent of the commit that added the refusal, `safeValidateSchema`
 * ACCEPTED the key in both nestings and KEPT it, and `ListView` grouped the board
 * by it. The protocol is what refuses it (`@objectstack/spec`'s strict
 * `KanbanConfigSchema`); this package did not, until the refusal.
 *
 * The message is read by an AUTHOR, from this package's own validator — so a
 * clause telling them their document was never validated is false at the very
 * place they read it. The same false clause was caught once before, in
 * objectui#8355's calendar stem, before it landed (objectui#9648).
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and why not the wording
 *
 * The refusal itself (`code` and `path` on both channels) is pinned by the
 * objectui#8365 tests; this file re-reads it only to find the message. It does
 * NOT pin the message's sentences. It asserts two things about CONTENT:
 *
 *   - NEGATIVE — no clause denies that the document passed a validator.
 *   - LIT CONTROL, on the true clause — the message still names the validator
 *     that accepted the key (`safeValidateSchema`) and the mechanism that kept it
 *     (`.passthrough()`). Without it, the negative is satisfied by a message
 *     that says nothing about the history at all.
 *
 * A third arm proves the negative's matcher fires on the retired clause, so a
 * later loosening of the pattern cannot turn the negative into a no-op.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION, predicted before running: restore the retired clause
 * in the message ⇒ the NEGATIVE arm goes red on both channels, while the lit
 * control and the matcher control stay green.
