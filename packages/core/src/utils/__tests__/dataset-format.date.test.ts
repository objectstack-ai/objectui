/**
 * objectui#7178 — a dataset measure over a date field renders as a date.
 *
 * `formatMeasure` opened with `if (typeof v !== 'number') return String(v)`,
 * placed BEFORE `format` was read. So a `min` / `max` over a date or datetime
 * field printed its stored value verbatim — a 24-character ISO string in the
 * KPI tile's `text-2xl font-semibold`, wrapped over two lines — and the
 * `format` that `DatasetMeasureSchema` accepts was unreachable for it.
 *
 * ── What these cases pin, and what they deliberately do NOT ─────────────────
 * The fix is a ROUTE, not a formatter: every byte of date rendering comes from
 * `../date-display.ts`, which is where `@object-ui/fields`' `formatDate` /
 * `formatDateTime` now live and what the `date` cell renderer, `ObjectGrid`'s
 * date cells and `ObjectGantt`'s tooltips call. So the cases below assert
 * AGREEMENT WITH THAT PATH rather than literal strings wherever the path's own
 * output is the contract — a literal would pin this file's opinion of a date,
 * which is exactly the second convention objectui#4576 says not to create.
 * (`DatasetWidget.dateMeasure.test.tsx` closes the loop on the rendered
 * surfaces, and `@object-ui/fields`' `date-display.reexport-identity.test.ts`
 * pins that the cell's `formatDate` and this one are the same function.)
 *
 * ── Directions, predicted in writing BEFORE the run ─────────────────────────
 *   the two date cases            RED pre-fix — they render the raw ISO string
 *   the `format`-as-style cases   RED pre-fix — `format` was never read here
 *   ⭐ every must-not-move case    GREEN on both sides. These are the guard,
 *                                 not the fix: the new branch runs ahead of
 *                                 the `String(v)` short-circuit, so it has to
 *                                 be shown NOT to capture numbers, numeric
 *                                 strings, the nullish em dash, or prose.
 *
 * The full before/after sweep is recorded in the PR: 33,696 argument forms
 * (value x format x currency x percentScale x locale) compared against a
 * verbatim copy of the pre-fix function, 4 distinct values moved — every one
 * of them ISO-shaped and parseable — and 0 expected movers missed.

/**
 * objectui#8352 — the DATETIME arm honours `format` too.
 *
 * Everything in the describe above exercises `ISO_DATE` only. That was the
 * blind spot: `formatMeasureDate` has two arms, `format` was threaded into the
 * date one and DROPPED on the datetime one, and a suite that never passed a
 * datetime through the `format` cases could not see it. A `Field.date` yields
 * `2026-09-08` and takes the first arm; a `Field.datetime` yields
 * `2026-09-01T00:00:00.000Z` and takes the second.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ Why the clock is pinned, and why these values are not the file's ─────
 * `formatRelativeDate` falls back to the absolute form beyond a ±7-day window,
 * so an OUT-OF-WINDOW value renders identically whether `format` is honoured
 * or dropped. Both readings that missed this defect were taken that way —
 * objectstack#15768's datum (`2026-07-04`) and the first dev probe
 * (`2026-07-28`) were 40–60 days old, so neither could fail in either
 * direction. `ISO_DATE` / `ISO_DATETIME` above are 2024 values and are
 * out-of-window by construction: they are the WRONG instrument for this card
 * and are deliberately not reused here.
 *
 * The window is relative to "now", so the cases below need a fixed "now" —
 * `vi.setSystemTime` with `toFake: ['Date']`, the convention already used in
 * `plugin-timeline` / `plugin-map`. The suite also pins `TZ=UTC`
 * (`vitest.config.mts`, objectui#8366), so a `Z`-suffixed instant and the
 * local calendar day `formatRelativeDate` computes from it cannot disagree.
 *
 * ── Directions, MEASURED by ablating the fix four ways ──────────────────────
 * Predicted first, then run; two predictions were wrong and these are the
 * observed columns, not the predicted ones. A = the pre-#8352 arm (`format`
 * dropped); B1 = wire the arm to `formatRelativeDate` unconditionally; B2 =
 * hand-roll the relative phrase, skipping the ±7-day window; C = thread
 * `format` into `formatDateTime`'s `options.style`.
 *
 *                                    A     B1    B2    C
 *   leg 1  in-window datetime       RED   RED   RED   RED
 *   leg 2  date-only control       green green green green   ← the rig check:
 *                                    no ablation of the DATETIME arm can move
 *                                    it, which is what makes it a control
 *   leg 3  out-of-window datetime   RED  green   RED   RED
 *   decisive pair                   RED  green   RED   RED
 *   `short` parity                  RED   RED   green  RED
 *   vocabulary equality             RED   RED   green  RED
 *   pass-through anti-pin          green green green  RED
 *   unstyled default guard         green  RED   green green
 *
 * ⭐ What each row adds, read off those columns. Leg 1 moves for all four, so
 * it DETECTS every ablation — but it does not distinguish them, and each fake
 * fix leaves something green that a trimmed suite would have relied on: B1
 * leaves leg 3 and the decisive pair green (its relative face is correct
 * inside the window), B2 leaves the `short` and vocabulary cases green (it
 * only touches the relative branch). The two must-not-move guards are where
 * the fake fixes separate from each other: B1 is the ONLY column that reddens
 * the unstyled-default guard, C the ONLY one that reddens the pass-through
 * anti-pin. Neither fake fix is hypothetical shape-fitting — both are what
 * "just make it relative" looks like when written quickly, and C is the
 * one-line change the signature invites.
 *
 * ⚠️ Leg 3 was predicted green-on-both-sides and measured RED under A. The
 * prediction assumed the pre-fix arm rendered the same absolute face this one
 * does; it does not — out of the window the honoured reading renders the
 * absolute DATE face (`formatRelativeDate`'s own fallback) while the pre-fix
 * arm rendered the absolute DATETIME face. The card's "indistinguishable out
 * of window" trap is about the BROWSER comparison it was measured in —
 * `format` absent beside `format: 'relative'`, which pre-fix were the same
 * bytes — and that reading is pinned on its own in leg 3's second assertion.
