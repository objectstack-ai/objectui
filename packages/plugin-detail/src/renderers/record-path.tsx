 * `record:path` — Salesforce Lightning Path-style stepper. Reads the value
 * of `schema.statusField` from the bound record and highlights the matching
 * stage in `schema.stages[]`. Stages preceding the current one render as
 * completed (with a check); the current renders as active; subsequent
 * stages render as upcoming.
 *
 * ── This surface is a READOUT, and it must look like one (objectui#5768) ──
 *
 * It used to draw each stage as a filled, shadowed, equal-width pill — the
 * exact shape of a segmented button group — while carrying no handler, no
 * cursor and no tab stop. Measured in a browser on a shipped build: the
 * segments were `role="listitem"` with `cursor: auto` and `tabindex` null,
 * and a full pointer sequence (pointerdown → mousedown → pointerup →
 * mouseup → click) left the record's status untouched. Users spent clicks
 * on it before concluding it was decoration.
 *
 * There is no write path to spend those clicks on: this renderer's only
 * channel is `useRecordContext()`, whose value (`RecordContextValue` in
 * `@object-ui/react`) exposes `data` / `refresh` / `headerSystemActions` /
 * `onToggleFavorite` and NO record-field mutation. Editing goes through
 * `record:details`' `<InlineEditProvider>` + `<InlineEditSaveBar>`
 * (`dataSource.update(..., { ifMatch })`) or an action via
 * `useActionEngine`; neither reaches here. Click-to-advance is a separate,
 * approved-on-its-own-appetite feature — until it exists, the pixels must
 * not promise it.
 *
 * So the presentation below is a PROGRESS RAIL: a thin decorative indicator
 * per stage with the label as plain text beneath it, which is the same
 * vocabulary app-shell's approval step readout already uses
 * (`RecordApprovalsPanel` — marker, rail, bare label, weight for "current",
 * never a filled surface). Deliberately absent: per-stage filled pills,
 * `shadow`, `ring`, bordered chips, and equal-width tap targets.
 *
 * The DOM attributes below carry state that used to live only in colour, so
 * the classification stays assertable without reading CSS (the test DOM
 * resolves no Tailwind):
 *   • `data-stage-state`     — `completed` | `current` | `upcoming`
 *   • `data-stage-terminal`  — `won` | `lost`, when a stage is classified
 *   • `data-stage-rail`      — marks the decorative indicator as an element
 *                              SEPARATE from the label. A rail has one; a
 *                              pill, which is its own label's surface, cannot.
 *
 * Those are TEST instruments, not accessibility: a `data-*` attribute is not in
 * the accessibility tree. The same state reaches a screen reader through each
 * stage's composed `aria-label` (objectui#5916) — see `stageAriaLabel` below.

  //
  //   1. `idx === last`. `WON_TOKENS` matches `完成`, an ordinary mid-path word,
  //      so `草稿 → 完成 → 已归档` classified index 1 as `won`: desktop declined
  //      it (not the last forward stage), mobile marked it the goal.
  //   2. The lost slice. Desktop hardcoded `terminal: 'lost'` onto EVERY stage
  //      of the separated alt group — a group defined POSITIONALLY, as
  //      `stages.slice(firstLostIdx)` — while mobile classified each stage on
  //      its own. So in `草稿 → 失败 → 已归档`, desktop painted `已归档`
  //      destructive and announced it `closed lost`; mobile painted it plain.
  //
  // Both are settled here, in one array both rows index, so a future divergence
  // is IMPOSSIBLE rather than merely absent — two rows that happen to agree
  // would leave the defect one edit away. The rule: `lost` is a property of the
  // STAGE; `won` is the GOAL TERMINUS, so it is the last forward stage or it is
  // nothing. Positional grouping stays a LAYOUT concern and no longer overrides
  // what a stage is.

    // announced identically as `{{stage}}, upcoming`. Same WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.1
    // class objectui#5916 closed, on the one distinction it left behind, and
    // reachable without authors opting in — `classify()` reaches `won` from an
    // explicit `terminal: 'won'` AND from the `WON_TOKENS` heuristic.
    //
    // Scoped to `upcoming` deliberately, and that scope is a MEASUREMENT of the
    // stylesheet above rather than a preference. The defect is information
    // carried by colour alone, so the name may only restate a distinction the
    // colour actually makes:
    //
    //   • upcoming  + won → `bg-emerald-500/30`, against `bg-muted` for a plain
    //                       upcoming stage. A real distinction: it gets a name.
    //   • current   + won → `bg-primary`, identical to every other current
    //                       stage. No visual distinction exists, so announcing
    //                       one would GIVE a screen-reader user information a
    //                       sighted user does not get — the mirror image of the
    //                       defect, and dead copy in ten packs besides.
    //   • completed + won → `bg-emerald-500`, again identical to every other
    //                       completed stage. Same answer.
    //
    // So a REACHED goal terminus keeps announcing as an ordinary current /
    // completed stage. One new key, not a pair.

          //   2. It would be redundant. Every stage inside already announces
          //      `closed lost` in the session locale (objectui#5916,
          //      `detail.pathStageLost*`), so "these are alternative terminal
