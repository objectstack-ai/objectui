/**
 * Nav-leaf → design-surface resolution for the Studio Interfaces pillar.
 *
 * The Interfaces pillar's rail is NOT a per-type list (the Data / Automations /
 * Access rails are — `object` / `flow` / `permission`). It is the current
 * package's App `navigation` tree: every leaf is rendered, and the one that
 * `resolveSurface` can bind to a `{type,name}` opens that item's design surface
 * (`getMetadataPreview` canvas + `getMetadataInspector` / default inspector).
 * A leaf that resolves to `null` renders DISABLED — correct for the nav
 * variants whose target is not an authorable metadata item (`url` points out of
 * the product, `component` names a first-party UI shipped in code), and a dead
 * entry for any variant that does have one. A `separator` resolves to `null`
 * too, but it is no leaf row: the rail draws it as a divider (objectui#11791).
 *
 * Extracted from `StudioDesignSurface.tsx` so the binding is unit-testable
 * without mounting the pillar — the same reason `packageSurfaces.ts` and
 * `centerTab.ts` live beside it.
