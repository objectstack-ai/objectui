/**
 * The published entry's LOCALE SHAPE, pinned (objectui#7479).
 *
 * ## What this stops
 *
 * `packages/i18n/src/index.ts` used to carry ten lines of
 * `export { default as <code> } from './locales/<code>.js'` plus a re-export of
 * `builtInLocales`. Either spelling makes all ten catalogues statically
 * reachable from any import of this package — an object literal naming ten
 * modules is the one shape no bundler can tree-shake — and the console measured
 * the result: ~450 KB gzipped of translation data fetched before first paint,
 * for a viewer who reads one catalogue.
 *
 * Restoring one line of that is a one-line regression that no BYTE budget
 * reports as one: the bytes land in a chunk whose ceiling was sized to hold
 * them. So the shape needs a pin of its own, and it needs TWO halves that fail
 * for different reasons:
 *
 *   - this file, on the SOURCE, so the cause is legible in a unit test with no
 *     console build in sight;
 *   - `scripts/check-eager-locale-catalogues.mjs`, on the BUILT bundle, so a
 *     new route to the same outcome — a page-load module importing the all-ten
 *     door, a chunk group that merges the catalogues back together, a bundler
 *     that stops honouring `import()` — is caught even when every source file
 *     still reads correctly.
 *
 * ⛔ Neither substitutes for the other. This one cannot see the bundle; that
 * one cannot run without a full build, and exits 2 rather than 0 when it has
 * none.
