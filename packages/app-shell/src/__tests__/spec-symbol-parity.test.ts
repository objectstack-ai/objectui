/**
 * app-shell ↔ `@objectstack/spec` symbol-collision tripwires
 * (objectui#3157, objectstack#4115 burn-down batch 3).
 *
 * Twenty-eight app-shell symbols used to be declared under names the spec
 * already owns. Twenty were burned down by importing or deriving the spec's own
 * type (nineteen plain re-exports — `DecisionOutputDef` joined them once the
 * spec adopted `required`, objectstack#4562 — plus `ScreenSpec`, still derived
 * structurally with one documented divergence); eight were renamed because they
 * model something the spec's same-named export does not.
 *
 * One symbol is in both camps: the object designer's `FieldGroup` was renamed to
 * `ObjectFieldGroup` AND derived — the spec owns that exact shape, just under
 * the other name, while its `FieldGroup` is the Studio field-editor's group
 * config. Renaming to the spec's own name was the fix.
 *
 * Later collisions are APPENDED to `RENAMES` under their own card rather than
 * folded into the census above: twenty-eight / twenty / eight is a measurement
 * of the batch-3 burn-down at the time it was taken, and re-counting it here
 * whenever a new symbol arrives would make it unreproducible.
 * `BrowserNotificationPreferences` (objectui#7011) is the first such arrival —
 * `hooks/notificationPreferences.ts` holds the two per-browser announcement
 * switches, which is a different layer from the spec's account-level delivery
 * routing; the measurement that decided rename-over-derive is in that file.
 *
 * A rename only stays a fix for as long as the new name is genuinely free. If
 * the spec later ships a `FlowDesignerNode`, this package would quietly be back
 * where it started — a local declaration under a spec export's name, read by
 * the next agent as the spec's own definition. These tests are that tripwire.
 *
 * ## Why the spec's names are read through the compiler, not `import * as`
 *
 * A runtime namespace import sees VALUES only, and almost every symbol in this
 * burn-down is a TYPE (`FieldInput`, `RuntimeConfig`, `ConversationSummary`, …).
 * A tripwire built on `Object.keys(await import('@objectstack/spec/ui'))` would
 * pass for every one of them while proving nothing — the same mistake the
 * guard's own header records having made in its first draft. So this reads each
 * subpath's `.d.ts` through the TypeScript checker, exactly as
 * `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs` does, and gets types and values
 * alike.
 *
 * ## What compiles the `type _X = Assert<…>` lines below (objectui#3181)
 *
 * Nothing did, for the first stretch of this file's life. `tsconfig.json` here
 * is the package BUILD config and excludes `**\/*.test.ts`; CI's only type gate
 * drives that config (`pnpm type-check` -> turbo -> per-package `tsc --noEmit`),
 * and types are erased before vitest ever runs. Appending a provably-false
 * `Assert<Equal<1, 2>>` to this file therefore passed `pnpm type-check` at exit
 * 0 — the type half of this "tripwire" was, literally, commentary. Which is the
 * same landmine this file's own header cites objectui#3009 for.
 *
 * They are now compiled by `packages/app-shell/tsconfig.test.json`, chained from
 * this package's `type-check` script (`tsc --noEmit && tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`),
 * i.e. run by the CI `Type Check` job. That project takes the whole test tree by
 * GLOB — `src/**\/*.test.ts` and `src/**\/*.test.tsx` — so **a new type-assertion
 * test file under `src/` is checked from the moment it is written**, with nothing
 * to register anywhere.
 *
 * That last sentence used to say the opposite, and the opposite used to be true:
 * a narrow `tsconfig.typetests.json` named its files one at a time while the rest
 * of this tree sat in TEST_DEBT, and a file was decoration until someone added it
 * to that list. The package graduated in objectui#4040 and the narrow project was
 * retired with it (objectui#4291 retired the last of them repo-wide; the debt
 * table is now empty). `scripts/check-type-check-coverage.mjs` fails if the
 * chaining is ever dropped, so the gate cannot go quiet again the way it did here.
