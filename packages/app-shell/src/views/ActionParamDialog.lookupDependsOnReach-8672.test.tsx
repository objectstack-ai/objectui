/**
 * objectui#8672 — a `dependsOn` lookup ACTION PARAM gates, UNGATES, and filters.
 *
 * ⭐ These were MEASUREMENT pins and are now CONTRACT pins. The file that stood
 * here recorded today's behaviour and endorsed none of it: legs A and C were
 * labelled "CURRENT SHAPE, NOT CONTRACT" and told whoever implemented one of the
 * card's three dispositions to expect them red and rewrite them. The maintainer
 * ruled **A — wire it** (director seat, decision batch #115, 2026-09-11), so
 * that is what happened: every `expect` below now states what the code MUST do.
 *
 * ## What ruling A settled, and what each leg holds to it
 *
 * - **Leg A — the dialog.** `ActionParamDialog` supplies its live record to the
 *   reference-bearing pickers, not only to the option widgets, so a lookup param
 *   declaring `dependsOn` is gated while the named parent is EMPTY and ungates
 *   the moment it carries a value. The record is the dialog's own in-progress
 *   `values`: unlike the grid (`ctx.pendingRow ?? ctx.row`, objectui#7165/#7188)
 *   this surface holds no row at all — its params ARE the record, which is the
 *   measurement the ruling left to the implementer.
 * - **Leg B — the authoring surface. UNCHANGED by the ruling, which says so in
 *   as many words:** `@objectstack/spec`'s `ActionParamSchema` still refuses
 *   `dependsOn` written INLINE on a param. The honoured route is the
 *   field-backed one, so leg A still has to synthesise a resolved
 *   `ActionParamDef` rather than author a param.
 * - **Leg C — the resolver.** `resolveActionParams` reads the DECLARED spelling
 *   `field.dependsOn` and no longer reads snake `field.depends_on`, which
 *   `FieldSchema` refuses by name. Both halves of that swap are pinned: the
 *   declared key must arrive, and the refused one must not.
 * - **Leg D — the two halves meeting.** The end-to-end route the repo's own
 *   `RESOLVED_ONLY_PARAM_KEYS.dependsOn` message points authors to ("make the
 *   param field-backed … to pick it up"), driven from an object field def
 *   through the resolver into the rendered dialog and out to the picker's
 *   query. ⭐ This is the leg that would have been impossible before the ruling
 *   and the one that fails if either half is reverted alone.
 *
 * ## Every reading still has a lit control beside it
 *
 * An ungated trigger and a narrowed candidate list are both shapes a broken
 * fixture produces for free, so neither is asserted alone:
 *
 * - leg A keeps the CONTROL lookup (identical but for `dependsOn`, asserted
 *   enabled throughout) and the keystroke witness — a `radio` whose `visibleWhen`
 *   reacts to the same keystroke — so "the gate lifted" is read against a
 *   keystroke proven to have reached the dialog, and it keeps the NEGATIVE
 *   control that an empty parent still gates, so the fix cannot be read as
 *   "the gate was deleted";
 * - leg B pairs each refusal with a positive control document that must PARSE
 *   and an unknown-key document that must be REFUSED;
 * - leg C pairs each reading with a sibling key resolved off the SAME field def
 *   in the same call;
 * - leg D offers two records under one reference and asserts the declared param
 *   sees one while the control param sees both — so a narrowed list cannot be a
 *   picker that simply failed to load.
