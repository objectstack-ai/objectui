 * objectui#10866, slice 4 — a day event moved across a DST change in the
 * month grid writes the days it was dropped on.
 *
 * ── What was measured ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * At slice 4 the month grid moved each date of an event by the milliseconds
 * between the grabbed cell's local midnight and the drop cell's. A date-only
 * value is read at local midnight of its day (`toDisplayDate`), so when a DST
 * change lay between one of the event's dates and where it landed, but not
 * between the two cells (or the other way round), that date came back an hour
 * off local midnight. Under `America/Los_Angeles` the clocks fall back on
 * November 1st, 2026 and spring forward on March 8th, 2026, and before slice 4
 * four of the ten day moves below wrote a day one short: the `Date` came back
 * at 23:00 of the day before, and the write takes its local day. Slice 4
 * repaired that in `ObjectCalendar`, from the stored day.
 *
 * ── Since objectui#11005 (ruled B) ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The month grid moves a value by calendar days and keeps its time of day
 * (the grid's own zone pins are `CalendarView.monthMoveCalendarDays-11005`).
 * A day read at local midnight now comes back at local midnight of the day it
 * was dropped on, so its local day is the day to write, and the slice-4
 * repair is gone. These ten day moves are how it was measured redundant: they
 * write exactly the days they wrote with it. The `datetime` controls keep
 * their wall-clock time across the DST change; the first Los Angeles one ends
 * at 10:00 on November 2nd, where the elapsed-time arithmetic put it at 09:00.
 *
 * `Asia/Shanghai` keeps no DST, so every day move there is the control zone.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ The zone cases run ONLY when driven, in a FORKS child ────────────────
 * `process.env.TZ` written inside a test of the normal run does not move the
 * zone (the root config runs `pool: 'threads'`), so the zone cases are
 * skipped there and `scripts/__tests__/date-only-zone-pins-10183.test.ts`
 * runs them on the forks pool and fails unless every one ran and passed. Each
 * zone opens with a rig case, so a child whose zone did not move reds instead
 * of going quietly green. The suite-zone cases run in the normal run too.
