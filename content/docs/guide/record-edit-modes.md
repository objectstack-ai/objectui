# Record Edit Modes

ObjectUI's default console shell (`@object-ui/app-shell`) supports two ways
to render the create/edit form for a record:

- **Modal** (default) — the form opens in an overlay dialog above the
  current view. Best for short forms, quick edits, and contextual data
  entry.
- **Page** — the form takes over a full route. Best for long forms,
  multi-tab or wizard layouts, or anywhere you need a deep-linkable URL
  that survives a refresh and integrates with the browser back button.

Both modes use the same `<ObjectForm>` pipeline under the hood, so all
field types, sections, validations, and visibility expressions work
identically in either mode.

## Choosing a mode

Set `editMode` on the object metadata:

```jsonc
// metadata/objects/account.json
{
  "name": "account",
  "label": "Account",
  "editMode": "page",       // "modal" (default) | "page"
  "fields": {
    "name":     { "type": "text",     "label": "Name", "required": true },
    "industry": { "type": "picklist", "label": "Industry" },
    "owner":    { "type": "lookup",   "label": "Owner", "reference_to": "user" }
  }
}
```

Omitting `editMode` (or setting it to `"modal"`) keeps the existing
behavior — clicking **Create** or **Edit** opens the global `ModalForm`
overlay.

## URL patterns

When `editMode: "page"` is set, the console renders the form on a
dedicated route under the active app:

| Action | URL |
|--------|-----|
| Create | `/apps/:appName/:objectName/new` |
| Edit   | `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit` |

Examples (for an app `sales` and an object `account`):

- Create: `https://your-console.example/apps/sales/account/new`
- Edit:   `https://your-console.example/apps/sales/account/record/0015e000abcd/edit`

These URLs are stable. Users can bookmark them, share them in chat, or
refresh the page mid-edit (the form rehydrates from the URL `:recordId`).

## Triggering the routes from JSON

In addition to the implicit "click create/edit on a list" entry point,
two declarative actions let you open the page-mode routes from an
`action:button` in metadata. The handler name goes in `actionType`: that
is the key the button renderer forwards to the action runner as the
action's type, and the runner dispatches to the handler registered under
it. Arguments go in a top-level `params` object:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "action:button",
  "label": "New Account",
  "icon":  "plus",
  "actionType": "navigate_create",
  "params": { "objectName": "account" }
}
```

`navigate_edit` additionally needs the record to open. `params` values
are templates: every string inside `params`, at any depth, is evaluated
the same way `properties` values are, so a button on a record page names
the record it sits on with `${record.id}`:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "action:button",
  "label": "Edit",
  "icon":  "pencil",
  "actionType": "navigate_edit",
  "params": {
    "objectName": "account",
    "recordId":   "${record.id}"
  }
}
```

`record` is the record the page is bound to. A template that cannot be
evaluated (on a page with no bound record, or with a misspelled root
such as `${recrod.id}`) reaches the handler as its raw `${…}` text, and
the development console reports it under `params.recordId`, so a wrong
template stays visible. A misspelled field on a bound record
(`${record.idd}`) is not an error: it resolves to nothing.

For a per-row **Edit** in a list, use the list view's built-in **Edit**
entry point: under `editMode: "page"` it already routes to the same URL
(see *Migrating an existing object* below).

When invoked from inside an `ObjectView`, the action context already
carries the active `objectName`, so `params` may be omitted entirely:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "action:button",
  "label": "New",
  "actionType": "navigate_create"
}
```

## Behavior summary

| Aspect | Modal | Page |
|--------|-------|------|
| Default | ✅ | — |
| Deep-linkable URL | ❌ | ✅ |
| Survives refresh | ❌ | ✅ |
| Back button closes form | n/a | ✅ |
| Best for | quick edits | long / multi-section forms |

## Migrating an existing object

The change is additive — existing apps continue to work unchanged. To
migrate a single object to page mode:

1. Add `"editMode": "page"` to the object metadata.
2. (Optional) Adjust the form layout — page mode pairs well with
   `formType: "tabbed"` or `formType: "wizard"` for long forms.
3. Reload the console. Existing **Create** / **Edit** entry points
   automatically route to the new pages; no UI code changes required.
