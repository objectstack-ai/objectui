/**
 * NavigationOverlay
 *
 * A reusable component that renders record detail overlays based on
 * ViewNavigationConfig mode. Supports drawer (Sheet), modal (Dialog),
 * split (ResizablePanelGroup), and popover modes.
 *
 * Works in conjunction with useNavigationOverlay hook from @object-ui/react —
 * the hook manages state while this component handles the visual presentation.
 *
 * What the hook is handed as `objectName` is the block's RECORD SOURCE — the
 * object the clicked rows actually came from — read through the ONE shared
 * reader `resolveRecordSourceObjectName` from `@object-ui/core`
 * (objectui#7627), and never a bare top-level `schema.objectName` in its place
 * (objectui#7638). `useNavigationOverlay`'s own doc block carries that rule in
 * full, including the caller with NO data config whose `schema.objectName`
 * already IS its record source; this example follows that block rather than
 * restating it, because a ruling written out twice is a ruling one of whose
 * copies rots — which is exactly what happened to this example (objectui#7787).
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import {
 *   resolveRecordSourceConfig,
 *   resolveRecordSourceObjectName,
 * } from '@object-ui/core';
 * import { useNavigationOverlay } from '@object-ui/react';
 * import { NavigationOverlay } from '@object-ui/components';
 *
 * const dataConfig = useMemo(() => resolveRecordSourceConfig(schema), [schema]);
 * const nav = useNavigationOverlay({
 *   navigation: schema.navigation,
 *   objectName: resolveRecordSourceObjectName(schema, dataConfig),
 * });
 *
 * return (
 *   <>
 *     <DataTable onRowClick={nav.handleClick} />
 *     <NavigationOverlay {...nav} title="Record Detail">
 *       {(record) => <RecordDetail record={record} />}
 *     </NavigationOverlay>
 *   </>
 * );
 * ```

 * rendered by the RENDERER, not by this overlay, so the overlay cannot find it
 * on its own, and `popoverTrigger` (which MOUNTS an element of its own inside
 * the overlay) is the wrong carrier for it — passing the row there would draw
 * a second copy of the row instead of pointing at the first.
 *
 * Two carriers, same recorder. Spread `anchorCaptureProps` on the renderer's
 * own container when the click reaches it without a DOM event (a chart, a
 * calendar grid); call `captureAnchor(event)` directly at a click site that
 * already HAS one (a kanban card, a tree row). Either way hand `anchorRef` to
 * {@link NavigationOverlayProps.popoverAnchorRef}. The container form uses the
 * capture phase deliberately: it runs before the bubbling `onClick` that opens
 * the overlay, so by the time the popover renders the anchor is recorded.
 *
 * It reads `target`, not `currentTarget`, because the handler sits on the
 * CONTAINER: `currentTarget` there is the whole view, and a popover anchored
 * to the whole board is not anchored to anything. `target` is the deepest
 * element under the pointer — the bar, the card, the cell — which is what the
 * user pointed at.
 *
 * ⚠️ Read synchronously, which is what this does: React nulls its event fields
 * out once the handler returns, so stashing the event rather than the element
 * would hand the overlay a dead reference.
 *
 * Clicks that do not open anything (a toolbar button, a filter) also land here
 * and are harmless: `anchorRef` is only ever read while the popover is open,
 * and the click that opened it is by construction the last one recorded.
