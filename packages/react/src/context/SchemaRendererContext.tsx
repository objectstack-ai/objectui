   * `DataSource<any> | null | undefined`, and `app-shell`'s README writes
   * `DataSource` against this very seam.

   * AdapterProvider connects, a widget test that drives `apiFetch` alone), and

   * states that actually occur and refuses everything else — a string, `{}`, a
   * plain data bag, a partial adapter missing a required member. It is spelled
   * exactly as `useSettledSchema` spells it, one hop away.

 * channel `useCondition` / `useExpression` merge under a locally-passed
 * context, and the one app-shell's `ExpressionProvider` already feeds. It is
 * NOT `SchemaRendererContext.dataSource`.
 *
 * `dataSource` is the host's injected ADAPTER, declared as the published
 * `DataSource` contract (objectui#7912). An adapter has no `users` member, no
 * `value` member, no member a `bind` path names — so walking it resolved
 * `undefined` for every conformant host, and the nine production readers of
 * this hook have all been running their fallback (`boundData || schema.items`,
 * `|| schema.nodes`, or a fall-through to their own fetch chain) ever since.
 * The only hosts it answered were ones injecting a data bag through a key the
 * contract says is an adapter, which has been a compile error since
 * objectui#7912.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling 2026-09-13 (option B) points it at the channel that can
 * actually answer it. No published key is added: the provider, the hook and
 * the host wiring all already exist.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` for an absent or empty path, and for any path the scope
 * does not carry — the readers' fallbacks are what run then, exactly as
 * before.
