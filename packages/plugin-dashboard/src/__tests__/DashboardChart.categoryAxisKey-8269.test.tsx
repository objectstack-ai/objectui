/**
 * objectui#8269 — the CATEGORY-axis binding both dashboard relays compose for
 * an object-bound aggregate. The mirror of
 * `DashboardChart.countSeriesKey-8266.test.tsx`, which pins the SERIES binding
 * of the same two sites.
 *
 * ## What was measured before the fix (origin/main `3c6394cb2`)
 *
 * A widget with `provider: 'object'` and `aggregate: { function: 'count',
 * groupBy: 'status' }` and NO `options.xField` — a perfectly ordinary way to
 * author a grouped chart — composed `xAxisKey: 'name'` on BOTH relays, because
 * each floored the binding on a literal:
 *
 *     const xAxisKey = options.xField || 'name';
 *
 * The rows an object-bound aggregate returns are keyed by the raw `groupBy`
 * field, so no row carries `name`, and `hasNoCategoryKey`
 * (`plugin-charts/src/AdvancedChartImpl.tsx`, framework#4033) refused the
 * widget with "no row has a `name` field" — a key the author never wrote,
 * while the `groupBy` they DID write went unmentioned.
 *
 * The picture that produced, and the picture the fix produces, is measured in
 * `plugin-charts/src/ObjectChart.categoryAxisKeyRender-8269.test.tsx`: a seam
 * assertion cannot tell a refusal from a plot, and `recharts` resolves inside
 * `plugin-charts` alone (verified: `require.resolve('recharts')` from
 * `packages/plugin-dashboard` is MODULE_NOT_FOUND, since it is a dependency of
 * `plugin-charts` and pnpm does not hoist it).
 *
 * ## Why the recorder rather than the real chart
 *
 * The decision under test is which column the RELAY names, and it is spelled
 * twice — `DashboardGridLayout` and `DashboardRenderer` each compose their own
 * `object-chart` node. Registering a recorder for the two component types those
 * nodes resolve to reads exactly that, from the real render path, for both
 * surfaces.
 *
 * ## All FOUR `xAxisKey` consumers are settled here, not two
 *
 * Each relay's single `xAxisKey` local feeds TWO composed nodes
 * (`DashboardGridLayout.tsx` 253 + 268, `DashboardRenderer.tsx` 632 + 658 on
 * `3c6394cb2`). They are NOT one decision spelled twice:
 *
 *   - the object-provider node (the first of each pair) is reached with an
 *     aggregate in hand and is what this file's first block fixes;
 *   - the authored-literal node (the second) is reached only AFTER
 *     `isObjectProvider` returns false, for a widget whose rows are a literal
 *     array the author wrote. There is no aggregate to consult and the
 *     author's `xField` names a column of their own rows, so the floor is
 *     CORRECT there and must stay — which the last block pins, in both
 *     directions, so a future "unify the two" refactor cannot quietly break it.
