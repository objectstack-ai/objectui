## 17.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e4559d1: `TimelineSchema` now declares the presentational keys the timeline renderer actually reads
  (objectui#6170, maintainer ruling 2026-08-25 — the same family rule adopted on
  objectui#6172: the exported type aligns to the measured authored + read set).
  
  Before this, `TimelineSchema` declared `events` (required), `orientation` and `position`,
  and nothing else. `TimelineRenderer` is annotated `schema: TimelineSchema` and reads nine
  keys off that node — `variant`, `items`, `dateFormat`, `onItemClick`, `minDate`, `maxDate`,
  `rowLabel`, `scale`, `timeScale` — and **none** of the three that were declared. The docs
  property table and the registration's own designer `inputs` had agreed with the renderer
  all along; only the exported type disagreed. It was invisible to `tsc` because `BaseSchema`
  carries `[key: string]: any`, so every undeclared key resolved as `any` and the annotation
  constrained nothing.
  
  The most visible casualty was the docs page's own TypeScript example, which did not
  compile: `Property 'events' is missing in type '{ type: "timeline"; variant: string; items:
  … }' but required in type 'TimelineSchema'`. The page taught an authoring form its own
  published type refused.
  
  **Declared now** (TS interface and the `@object-ui/types/zod` mirror together): `variant`,
  `items`, `dateFormat`, `scale`, `timeScale`, `rowLabel`, `minDate`, `maxDate`. `onItemClick`
  is deliberately left undeclared — it is a runtime slot `ObjectTimeline` installs, and this
  package keeps callback-shaped keys off the authored surface.
  
  **`scale` is the canonical axis key.** It is `@objectstack/spec`'s `ui/TimelineConfig.json`
  spelling and the one `resolveTimelineScale` reads first (`scale ?? timeScale`). The designer
  now offers it, with all six buckets: `hour` / `quarter` / `year` have rendered correctly
  since objectui#2942 but were offered by neither the designer (which listed three) nor the
  exported type (which listed none), so they were authorable and undiscoverable. `timeScale`
  stays as a deprecated alias so stored JSON keeps working; retiring it is routed separately.
  
  **`events` is now optional.** It was required, which is why the documented authoring form
  did not type-check. That widening is the only non-additive change here — strictly more
  programs compile and strictly more input parses than before. `events`, `orientation` and
  `position` remain declared and remain read by nothing; a timeline authored with `events`
  still renders an empty rail. Their removal is a breaking narrowing of a published type and
  is routed through ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove as its own change, not smuggled into this one.
  
  Accept-set note for consumers: keys that previously resolved as `any` are now typed, so a
  value the renderer never implemented — `variant: 'diagonal'`, `dateFormat: 'medieval'`,
  `scale: 'fortnight'` — is a type error and a Zod rejection where it used to pass silently.
  Nothing that renders today stops rendering. `BaseSchema`'s index signature is untouched, so
  an undeclared key is still accepted by both halves (objectui#5155 / objectui#6269 own that
  ceiling).
- 9d86e1d: Retire the `timeScale` alias on the timeline node — `scale` is the only axis spelling
  (objectui#6355, maintainer ruling 2026-08-27).
  
  **BREAKING for authored metadata.** `timeScale` was this renderer's pre-spec spelling of the
  Gantt axis bucket. `scale` is canonical — it is `@objectstack/spec` `ui/TimelineConfig.json`'s
  axis key and the key the renderer preferred (objectui#6170 ruling, 2026-08-25: `timeScale`
  goes the alias-retirement route, not a silent second spelling). objectui#6355's ruling
  retires it immediately, with no phased window, while the project is at startup stage.
  
  **What breaks, and how you will find out.** A timeline document that spells `timeScale` is
  now **refused**, loudly, at the authoring boundary:
  
  - `TimelineSchema.timeScale` is declared `?: never` — writing it is a type error;
  - the Zod twin declares `z.never().optional()` — parsing a document that carries the key
    fails with `invalid_type` / `expected: never` on the `timeScale` path.
  
  The fix is a rename: `timeScale` → `scale`. The accepted values are unchanged (`hour`,
  `day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter`, `year`), so no value needs rewriting.
  
  **Why a tombstone rather than deleting the key.** `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()` on the
  Zod side and carries `[key: string]: any` on the TS side, so an *undeclared* key is accepted
  unvalidated by both halves. Deleting `timeScale` outright would have let the retired spelling
  parse green and type-check green while the renderer no longer read it — the Gantt axis would
  silently fall back to the `month` default, the chart would change bucket, and nothing would
  error. That is the silent axis breakage objectui#2942 closed, running in the other direction,
  and it is the specific outcome this retirement is shaped to prevent. Keeping the key declared
  as `never` on both halves is what makes the removal audible. Absent stays valid on both, so a
  document that never wrote the alias is untouched.
  
  Also in this change:
  
  - `resolveTimelineScale` drops the `?? schema.timeScale` fallback read; its parameter narrows
    to `{ scale?: unknown }`.
  - The designer drops its deprecated `timeScale` input. The `scale` input already offers all
    six buckets.
  - `ObjectTimeline` now emits the resolved axis under `scale` when it composes the schema it
    hands to the renderer. It previously wrote the alias, which would have made **every**
    object-bound Gantt fall through to the `month` default the moment the fallback read went —
    silently, since that is a composed schema no author ever sees. Writing `scale` after the
    spread also restores the precedence the surrounding code intends: a `timelineConfig.scale`
    now actually beats a flat `schema.scale`, where under the alias the resolver's
    `scale ?? timeScale` ordering let the flat key win.
  - The two in-repo authors are migrated in the same change: the schema-catalog
    `gantt-style-timeline.json` fixture and the registration's own `examples.gantt` block.
  - Docs drop the `timeScale` row and gain a retirement callout;
    `packages/components/.../TIMELINE.md`'s Gantt table now documents `scale` with the full
    six-value vocabulary it has accepted since objectui#2942 (its row still claimed three).
  
  Version note: `minor`, not `major`, per AGENTS.md §版本号策略 — objectui's major tracks the
  `@objectstack` major and all publishable packages share one `fixed` group, so a breaking
  narrowing is declared `minor` with the break spelled out here.
- 20cb8db: `ObjectTimeline` refuses an undeclared date axis instead of inventing one
  (objectui#7459).
  
  Steps ① and ② of the three-step sequence the maintainer ruled on objectui#7070
  (2026-09-01, 总监批 #28). House posture, on record with that ruling:
  日期轴永不虚构 — a date axis is never fabricated.
  
  `ObjectTimeline` resolved its date axis through five declared bindings and then
  closed the chain with a sixth rung that was a bare literal field name nobody
  has ever declared. A name therefore ALWAYS resolved: for a view that declared
  no axis, every record read a key its object does not carry, every event landed
  in the "No date" bucket, and the screen read as a timeline that had been built
  and simply had nothing in it.
  
  Two changes, shipped together because neither is observable alone:
  
  - **The renderer now refuses.** An object-bound timeline with no declared date
    axis renders a diagnostic naming every binding it accepts —
    `timeline.startDateField`, `timeline.dateField`, `mapping.date`, and the two
    deprecated flat spellings — instead of a chart. The twin of `ObjectGantt`'s
    "Gantt configuration required" screen, in the shape objectui#7070 settled.
  - **The invented sixth rung is gone**, which is the only thing that makes the
    refusal reachable. Added while the floor stood, it would have been dead code;
    retired without the refusal, it would have produced exactly the silent
    "No date" outcome the ruling rejects.
  
  **What changes for an author.** A view that declares a date axis is completely
  unaffected — all five declared spellings resolve exactly as before, and a
  timeline authored from literal `items` is never refused, since its items carry
  their own dates and no field name is read for them. A view that declared no
  axis anywhere, and was rendering an empty-looking timeline, now says so.
  
  ⚠️ Both premises were RE-MEASURED on the current tree before anything was
  edited, rather than taken from the card: the renderer had no absent-axis
  refusal (against a live control term that fires in the same file), and the
  floor was still present and still spelled as reported. The pairing itself is
  pinned — the refusal cases go red the moment the floor returns, including one
  whose records carry a column that happens to be named `date`, where a returned
  floor renders a convincing timeline rather than an empty one.
  
  Refusal is distinguished from "renders an empty timeline" by asserting the
  canvas is ABSENT, not merely event-free. The component's success surface is now
  named (`data-testid="timeline-canvas"`) so that distinction can be measured;
  every other terminal state of the component already named itself.
  
  Step ③ of the ruling — the `'created_at'` floors on the two plugin faces —
  stays on objectui#7070 and is deliberately NOT in this change.

### Patch Changes

- 39f4309: Published typings from every `vite-plugin-dts` package now carry an explicit extension on
  every relative specifier, and a type error in the declaration build now fails the build
  instead of being printed and ignored (objectui#5439, objectui#5483).
  
  **Consumers on `moduleResolution: nodenext` or `node16` may see NEW type errors, and that
  is the fix working.** These packages re-export mostly through NAMED re-exports —
  `export { useObjectChat } from './useObjectChat'`. TypeScript could not follow the
  extensionless hop, but it still DECLARED the name, so the symbol resolved to a silent
  `any`. Nothing errored; consumers simply got no types. With the extension emitted, the
  symbol carries its real type, and any call site that was relying on the `any` now type
  checks for the first time. This is the mode that produced the 21 residual `TS7006` on
  `@object-ui/app-shell` reported against objectui#5365 — a type hole that opened quietly,
  unlike objectui#5365's own `export * from './ui'` packages where the same defect surfaced
  immediately as `TS2305: has no exported member`.
  
  410 extensionless relative specifiers across 19 packages were emitted before this change;
  the count is now 0 in all 22 packages that build typings through `vite-plugin-dts`.
  `@object-ui/fields` was already clean — its sources write explicit `.js` specifiers — and
  is wired so it stays that way.
  
  The second half changes no emitted output today: 22/22 packages built green unmodified, so
  making the declaration step's exit code honest turns nothing red. It changes what a FUTURE
  regression does — print and exit 0, versus fail the build.
- d813e8b: The bare `timeline` component key is now owned by DECLARATION rather than by
  module-evaluation order (objectui#6353).
  
  `packages/plugin-timeline` registers the same short name twice —
  `plugin-timeline:timeline` (`src/renderer.tsx`, the presentational renderer) and
  `view:timeline` (`src/index.tsx`, the object-bound `ObjectTimelineRenderer`). Neither
  passed `skipFallback`, so under `Registry.register` both also claimed the **bare**
  `timeline` key and the last module to evaluate won it. `src/index.tsx` re-exports
  `./renderer` (line 300) before its own `import` (line 307), so the presentational one
  registered first and the object-bound one overwrote it.
  
  The resolved outcome was the intended one and **does not change here**: `type:
  'timeline'` still renders `ObjectTimelineRenderer`, which delegates inward to the
  presentational renderer. What changes is that it is now decided rather than inherited.
  Reordering those two lines would previously have handed `type: 'timeline'` to the
  presentational renderer, which reads none of the object-bound keys (`object`, `filter`,
  `sort`, `limit`) — an authored timeline would have stopped fetching, with no error and
  no failing test. The registry's own collision guard names this remedy in its warning
  text; this applies it.
  
  `src/renderer.tsx` now registers with `skipFallback: true`, so only `view:timeline`
  claims the bare key, in any evaluation order. The presentational renderer stays
  reachable under its explicit `plugin-timeline:timeline` key, which is the lookup a
  presentational host already uses — no consumer-visible resolution changes.
  
  `src/__tests__/timeline-bare-key-ownership.test.ts` is the half that outlives the fix:
  it fails if the declaration is dropped, if a third registration starts claiming the bare
  key, or if resolution becomes order-dependent again. It reads both registrations' real
  declared metadata back out of the registry and replays them into a fresh `Registry` in
  **both** orders, so order-independence is a property under test rather than a property
  of the file the test happens to import.
- f7ea89b: An object-bound timeline with `variant: 'gantt'` refuses loudly instead of
  throwing (objectui#6655).
  
  The two timeline item shapes are not interchangeable, and this path crossed
  them. `ObjectTimeline` maps each record to a flat FEED item — one per record,
  no nested `items` — while the renderer's gantt branch reads a gantt ROW
  (`row.items[].startDate`). Every `row.items` was therefore `undefined`,
  `calculateDateRange` reduced an empty list, `Math.min()` over it was `Infinity`,
  and `new Date(Infinity).toISOString()` threw `RangeError: Invalid time value`
  mid-render. There was no guard and no diagnostic — the component simply threw.
  
  Per the maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29, the object-bound path now rejects
  `variant: 'gantt'` with an author-facing diagnostic naming the limitation
  (object-bound timelines render the feed variants; gantt needs literal rows, each
  carrying its own nested items). Composing real gantt rows from records was
  considered and NOT adopted; that capability stays open and unruled.
  
  The refusal keys on whether the items were AUTHORED, not on the variant alone,
  so a literal gantt is untouched — including the bare `timeline` key that this
  component answers, which is what the in-repo catalog fixture
  `plugin-timeline/gantt-style-timeline.json` uses. The feed variants
  (`vertical` / `horizontal`) and the presentational `TimelineRenderer` are
  unchanged.
  
  Side effect the ruling asked for: the gantt-only axis this path composes
  (`timeline.scale ?? scale`) is no longer silently inert on the gantt variant —
  an author who set it is now told why it has no effect, rather than getting a
  crash.
- 3beef6d: The spec's `dataSource` element binding is now DECLARED by the blocks that read
  it, so the html tier stops reporting the one working saved-view spelling as
  `unknown-prop` (objectui#6678).
  
  `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` — `{ object, view, filter, sort, limit }` — is
  the one spelling that resolves a saved view for an object-bound block. It works,
  and it drew the identical `unknown-prop` warning as the two spellings that do
  nothing (`viewName`, `view`), because `validateTree` looks a prop up in the
  block's declared `inputs` and no registration declared this key. On the tier
  built to accept AI-authored pages, where the diagnostic IS the contract, the
  only signal pointed away from the key that works.
  
  Adopting the maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29 — option B **in the injection
  form**:
  
  - `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT` is the single declaration, in `@object-ui/core`
    beside the binding's own semantics; `Registry.register` emits it for any
    registration whose renderer passed through the new `elementDataSourceBlock()`
    seam. One mechanism, one copy — not a hand-kept declaration per block, which is
    the shape that drifts and that a new block forgets. The seam lives in
    `@object-ui/core` and is re-exported by `@object-ui/react` beside
    `ElementDataSourceGate` for discoverability; call sites take the core import,
    because a registration runs at module scope and this repo's suites partially
    mock `@object-ui/react`.
  - Seventeen renderers, in thirteen files across twelve packages, reach the seam
    and now publish the key to the save gate, the parser whitelist, the generated
    JSX authoring types and the block list. The card named nine blocks; the tree
    also has `plugin-grid`, `plugin-timeline`, two further `plugin-form` blocks and
    `element:record_picker` — nothing was hand-listed, so the mechanism covered
    them. `element:record_picker` consumes the gate's HOOK and status panels rather
    than the wrapper tag (its object lives under `properties`), and was found by a
    render probe rather than by reading sources.
  - `dataSource` on a block that does NOT read it (`flex`, `card`) still reports
    `unknown-prop`. Adding the key to `sdui-parser`'s `BASE_PROPS` was refused for
    exactly this reason — that set mirrors `BaseSchema`, and silencing the key
    everywhere would make the diagnostic lie in the other direction.
  - New `check:element-data-source-declaration` fails any source that consumes the
    gate without reaching the seam, so a block added tomorrow cannot forget.
  
  Behaviour of the binding itself is unchanged — this is a declaration, not a
  resolution change. The saved view still resolves its columns, and an
  unresolvable `view` still fails loudly rather than widening to the object's full
  scope.
  
  The spec/registry parity gates (repo-wide and the `record:related_list` per-block
  pin) now derive their accepted set from the WHOLE node contract rather than from
  `ComponentPropsMap[type]` alone. `PageComponentSchema` accepts and keeps
  `dataSource` on a page-component node — it is a node-level key, a sibling of
  `type` and `className`, not a per-block prop — so the gates' previous complaint
  was measurably wrong. Derived from the spec, not exempted, and both still
  discriminate against an invented key.
- 15b1776: A gantt timeline with an EMPTY literal `items` array renders a zero-row grid instead of
  throwing (objectui#6750).
  
  `calculateDateRange` reduced the empty list with no guard: `allDates` is `[]`, `Math.min()`
  over no arguments is `Infinity`, and `new Date(Infinity).toISOString()` throws `RangeError:
  Invalid time value` during render. Both entry points crashed identically — `TimelineRenderer`
  given `{ variant: 'gantt', items: [] }`, and `ObjectTimeline` given the same schema (an
  authored empty array is truthy, so it passes straight through as authored items).
  
  An empty gantt is the **ordinary empty state of a valid schema**, not a malformed document.
  Any author or generator that builds `items` from a collection emits `items: []` the moment
  the collection is empty — a filtered project list with no matches, a fresh workspace, a plan
  whose rows are yet to be added.
  
  The fix covers the whole gantt branch in one pass rather than the one `throw`, because
  patching only the crash site moves it two stops down the same branch:
  
  - `calculateDateRange` returns a one-day sentinel range anchored on today when the rows carry
    no dates at all. The span is one day — the smallest coherent range — because how much time
    an empty gantt should show is a question about what an empty gantt should look like, which
    this change deliberately does not answer.
  - `generateTimeScaleHeaders` needed no change, and that is a measured verdict rather than an
    assumption: a degenerate `min === max` range is not inverted, so the loop runs once and
    every scale emits exactly one bucket. The empty gantt therefore gets a real one-column axis,
    not a header row with zero cells.
  - `calculateBarDimensions` gains a `totalDuration === 0` guard. A zero-width axis — every task
    starting and ending on the same day, or an author pinning `minDate === maxDate` — divided
    `0 / 0` into `NaN`, and the bar was handed `left: NaN%; width: NaN%`. That is not a crash
    and not a visible error: the CSSOM rejects both declarations, so React left the element with
    no `style` attribute at all and the bar rendered unpositioned and zero-width. On a zero-width
    axis every task covers the whole of it by definition, so the guard returns `{ start: 0,
    width: 100 }`.
  
  An author-pinned `minDate` / `maxDate` is untouched by the sentinel: the gantt branch resolves
  `schema.minDate || dateRange.minDate`, so a pinned range with `items: []` renders exactly that
  range with no rows in it — most likely what the author wanted, and free.
  
  **No product judgment about what an empty gantt should look like.** "Do not crash" is a
  correctness floor; whether the empty case should become the repo's standard empty-state panel
  instead of a zero-row grid is a separate, still-open question, and substituting one here would
  have been taking a decision that was left open on purpose. objectui#6655's object-bound gantt
  refusal is also untouched and stays keyed on whether items were authored, which is precisely
  why it does not fire on this case.
- 4f3a1e2: fix(plugin-timeline): refuse an unusable gantt date range with a diagnostic that names the offending value
  
  A gantt whose date range cannot be used now renders a `role="alert"` diagnostic
  naming the value that made it unusable, instead of crashing or drawing a chart
  that is confidently wrong. Two input classes, which failed in opposite
  directions:
  
  - A date that does not parse threw `RangeError: Invalid time value` mid-render —
    the same crash site objectui#6750 guarded for the empty list, on a different
    input. This covers a malformed value (`startDate: 'not-a-date'`), an absent
    one, and an unparseable `minDate` / `maxDate` pinned on the schema.
  - An inverted pinned range (`minDate` after `maxDate`) drew a bar at
    `left: 157.9%; width: -4.3%` under a header row with zero cells, with no
    error and no diagnostic.
  
  Valid gantts, the empty-list sentinel from objectui#6750 and the degenerate
  `minDate === maxDate` axis are unchanged.
- e661d63: fix(plugin-timeline): refuse a `null` gantt date instead of drawing it at the epoch
  
  `new Date(null).getTime()` is `0`, not `NaN` — the Unix epoch, not an invalid
  date — so a `null` `startDate` / `endDate` passed the objectui#6759 parse guard
  and reached the arithmetic as `1970-01-01`. One row item with `endDate: null`
  drew a 649-column axis spanning 1970 to 2024 and a bar at
  `left: 100%; width: -100%`, with no error and no diagnostic; a `null`
  `startDate`, or both null, drew a bar with entirely plausible geometry on an
  axis anchored in 1970 — a chart a reader would believe.
  
  A `null` row date now renders the same `role="alert"` diagnostic objectui#6759
  established, naming the authored path and spelling the value as `null`. This is
  consistency with that card rather than a new policy: it already refuses the same
  absence spelled `undefined` (an omitted `endDate`), and which of the two a
  document carries is decided by the record mapping upstream, not by the author.
  
  Unchanged: a `minDate` / `maxDate` pinned as `null` is falsy, so the caller
  discards it and the rows' own range still renders; numeric timestamps and `Date`
  instances still render; objectui#6750's empty-list sentinel and every valid
  gantt are untouched.
- 85f6a60: Gantt dates are now judged by TYPE: a `string`, a finite `number`, or a `Date`
  — anything else is refused (objectui#6781, maintainer ruling 2026-08-30).
  
  **This is a reject-direction change. Metadata that renders a chart today can
  stop rendering one.** `new Date(x)` runs ToPrimitive on anything, so values that
  are not dates at all used to become instants silently. These now produce the
  same loud diagnostic #6759 and #6770 already use — an alert naming the authored
  path and the offending value — instead of a chart:
  
  | authored gantt date — a row item's `startDate` / `endDate`, or a **truthy** `minDate` / `maxDate` pin | before | after |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `false` | a 649-column axis starting Jan 1970, bar `width: -100%`, no warning | refused, named |
  | `true` | the same 1970 axis | refused, named |
  | `['2024-01-01']` | drew a normal-looking chart | refused, named |
  | `[0]` | drew a chart dated to the **year 2000** | refused, named |
  | `{ toString() { return '2024-01-01' } }` | drew a normal-looking chart | refused, named |
  | a `bigint` or a `symbol` | threw an uncaught `TypeError` mid-render | refused, named |
  
  **Falsy pins are not affected, and never were.** A `minDate` / `maxDate` of
  `false`, `0` or `''` is discarded by the renderer's existing truthy-only `||`
  before anything judges it: such a pin never produced a 1970 axis and it is not
  refused now — the chart simply uses the range computed from the rows, exactly as
  it did before. The before/after readings above are row-date readings.
  
  **If your gantt stops drawing after this upgrade, the diagnostic names the exact
  authored path** (e.g. `items[0].items[0].endDate`). Fix it at the producer: emit
  a date string (`'2024-01-01'`), a millisecond timestamp (`1704067200000`), or a
  `Date`. A boolean or an object arriving in a date field means an upstream
  mapping picked the wrong column — the chart was drawing 1970 from it before, and
  that render was never right.
  
  **`0` keeps working, deliberately.** It is a legitimate epoch timestamp — under
  a millisecond encoding an author who writes `0` means 1970-01-01 — so it is
  accepted and renders exactly as it did before. `NaN` and `Infinity` are refused,
  as they already were.
  
  Unchanged for everyone else: valid string / numeric / `Date` dates draw the same
  axis and the same bar geometry, an empty gantt keeps its one-bucket sentinel,
  and `null` / absent dates keep the identical diagnostic they got before.
- 7fc5c3c: Spell a refused gantt date by a RULE, not by `String` (objectui#6907)
  
  `spellGanttDateValue` fills the `{{value}}` hole of the unusable-gantt-date
  alert, whose job is to name the value the author wrote. Its `String(value)`
  fallback was written when nothing but `[object Object]`-shaped values could
  reach it; objectui#6905's type rule routes the whole non-date type space
  through it, and it failed three ways — measured on `b458300ca`:
  
  - it **VANISHES**: `endDate: []` rendered "endDate is , which is not a valid
    date", the value gone from its own sentence;
  - it **LIES**: `['2024-01-01']` read as `2024-01-01` and `[0]` / `0n` as `0` —
    a text that IS a valid date, and a number that IS an accepted one (`0` is a
    kept gantt date), so the author was told a correct-looking value was invalid
    with no hint the wrapper was at fault;
  - it **THROWS**: `{ toString() { throw } }`, a throwing `Symbol.toStringTag`
    getter and `Object.create(null)` each crashed the render outright. #6759 built
    this helper "total by construction" and #6905 made that load-bearing, but the
    type gate only stopped `new Date` from throwing — `String(value)` handed
    control to author code one line later, so the crash class moved into the
    speller instead of going away.
  
  The rule now recorded on the helper:
  
      Spell the value when the LANGUAGE owns its spelling.
      Name its TYPE when producing text would run AUTHOR code.
  
  Every primitive keeps a spelling fixed by the grammar, so it is spelled as the
  author typed it — including `bigint`, which gains its `n` (`0n`, no longer the
  accepted `0`). A `Date` uses `Date.prototype.toString.call`, byte-identical to
  `String` but not hijackable by a subclass. Everything else is named:
  `an array`, `a function`, `an object`, chosen with `Array.isArray` and `typeof`,
  which read no author-controlled property.
  
  `JSON.stringify` is refuted, not overlooked: it throws on a `bigint` and on a
  cycle, which would put the crash class straight back. A bounded rendering is
  refused on the same ground — even an element count is not total, because
  `Array.isArray` is true of a Proxy whose `length` trap throws.
  
  Which values are refused is unchanged (that is objectui#6781's ruling), the
  `undefined` / `null` / quoted-string spellings pinned by #6759 and #6770 do not
  move, the shared inverted-range diagnostic reads identically, and no new i18n
  key is added — the article rides in the existing `{{value}}` hole.
- c17446a: Gantt date type gate: judge the `[[DateValue]]` slot, not the prototype chain
  (objectui#7027).
  
  `isGanttDateType` asked `value instanceof Date`, which answers "does this
  inherit from `Date.prototype`?" and not "is this a `Date`?". An object that
  inherits the prototype without owning the internal slot passed the gate,
  reached `new Date(value)`, ran ToPrimitive, and threw
  `TypeError: Method Date.prototype.toString called on incompatible receiver` —
  uncaught, mid-render, so the author got a blank screen where #6781's named
  diagnostic belongs. Three spellings crashed on `main`, measured:
  `Object.create(Date.prototype)`, that impostor behind a `Proxy` that throws on
  every get, and a `Proxy` with a throwing `getPrototypeOf` trap (`instanceof` is
  not total on its own terms either).
  
  Both sites now ask a total brand test that invokes the builtin
  `Date.prototype.getTime` with `.call`: it reads the receiver's `[[DateValue]]`
  slot and nothing else, so no author getter runs, no `Symbol.toStringTag` is
  consulted, and no proxy trap fires. The two brand tests the finding suggested
  were measured and rejected — `Object.prototype.toString.call` performs
  `Get(O, @@toStringTag)` unconditionally, and `Number.isFinite(value.getTime())`
  calls the author's `getTime`, which would refuse a real `Date` subclass by
  dying on it. Both are pinned as red rows.
  
  No change to which values are accepted: #6781's accept set
  (`string | finite number | Date`) is untouched, `new Date(NaN)` still passes
  the type gate and is still refused by the parse check with its `Invalid Date`
  spelling, and every newly-refused value is one no authored document can carry
  (ObjectUI metadata is JSON, which cannot spell a prototype).
- 20c04b2: A gantt timeline whose rows are malformed now refuses to draw, naming the row,
  instead of crashing the render (objectui#7164, maintainer ruling A+).
  
  `TimelineRenderer`'s gantt branch used to read the authored rows twice — once
  defensively in `findUnusableGanttDate`, once bare in `calculateDateRange` — and
  every input in the gap threw a `TypeError` mid-render from ordinary JSON:
  `items: [null]`, a row whose `items` is `5` / `true` / `{}` / an array-like
  object, or `items` itself not an array. The three readers (the date scan, the
  range computation and the render loop) now consume ONE verdict from
  `classifyGanttRows`, and a malformed shape renders the existing `role="alert"`
  refusal through a new diagnostic key,
  `timeline.gantt.unusableRange.malformedRow` — "items[0] is null, which is not
  a row shape" — never the `malformedDate` copy, which named the wrong fault.
  The key lands in `en` and the nine sibling locale packs.
  
  `@object-ui/types` (minor — the accept set narrows): `TimelineSchema.items` no
  longer declares `z.array(z.any())`. Every element must be an object, and a
  gantt row's own `items`, when present, must be an array, so `validate` refuses
  `items: [null]` and `items: [{ items: 5 }]` at authoring time — before they
  reach a renderer. Feed items (`vertical` / `horizontal`) carry no `items` key
  and parse exactly as before; every in-repo `type: 'timeline'` fixture parses
  green on both sides of the change. Rows with no bars (`items: []`, a row
  without `items`) stay the ordinary empty state and still draw.
- e75f4c9: `colorField` now means the same thing in the gantt, the calendar and the timeline
  (objectui#7243).
  
  **The inversion this fixes.** `gantt.colorField` is documented as "field that drives the
  bar color", and the renderer passed the stored value straight into the bar's
  `backgroundColor`. Pointing the key at a select field therefore emitted
  `backgroundColor: "open"` — not a colour, so the browser dropped the declaration and
  every bar rendered identically. OMITTING the key was strictly better: the absent-key
  branch derived a real colour per status. Declaring the documented key was worse than not
  declaring it, with no error, warning or console message either way.
  
  The same key also meant three different things across the three lenses: the timeline
  resolved the field's authored option `color`, the calendar hashed the raw value onto a
  fixed palette, and the gantt emitted the raw value. An author colouring three views by
  one field got three unrelated results, one of which was no colour at all.
  
  **The ladder.** `@object-ui/core` gains `createFieldColorResolver` — the timeline's
  resolver, lifted so all three call it:
  
  1. the field's own option `color` for the record's value;
  2. else the value itself when it already IS a colour literal (`#rgb`, `#rrggbb`,
     `#rrggbbaa`, `rgb(...)`, `hsl(...)`);
  3. else each renderer's own last rung, which is deliberately NOT shared — the gantt
     derives a semantic-token hex (a bar must be painted), the calendar keeps its
     theme-aware 8-stop hash (a soft tint, not a solid fill), the timeline draws its
     default marker.
  
  **What changes for authors.** A gantt or calendar whose `colorField` points at a select
  field with authored option colours now paints those colours. A gantt value that is
  neither an option colour nor a colour literal now derives a colour instead of emitting
  an invalid CSS value — including a palette NAME (`red`), which now resolves to that
  palette's hex, the behaviour the key's own contract has always promised ("hex or
  semantic name") and the one `borderColorField` already had. `gantt.borderColorField`
  takes rung 1 as well, so an authored option colour reaches the alert stroke; it keeps
  today's behaviour otherwise and deliberately gains no derivation rung, since the stroke
  is opt-in and deriving one for every record would draw an alert on records that have
  none.
  
  Calendars whose `colorField` points at a plain categorical field are unchanged: that
  value still reaches `CalendarView`'s deterministic hash exactly as before. The timeline
  is unchanged apart from accepting the 8-digit `#rrggbbaa` hex spelling the calendar
  already accepted.
- d327b9c: FLS-gate the `$expand` projection at the seven remaining `buildExpandFields`
  call sites (objectui#7429).
  
  objectui#7215 / PR #7229 gated the two projection sites in its scope
  (`ObjectGrid`, `ListView`). objectui#7230 / PR #7428 gated four more
  (`ObjectCalendar`, `ObjectGantt`, `RecordDetailView`, `DetailView`). This
  closes the seven that were left: `ObjectKanban`, `ObjectTree`, `ObjectView`
  (the non-grid record-fetch effect), `ObjectMap`, `ObjectGallery`,
  `ObjectTimeline`, and the metadata-admin `PagePreview`'s record-binding fetch.
  
  **All seven pass no column list at all**, which makes every one of them the
  sharp shape: `buildExpandFields` reads an absent column list as "no column
  restriction" and falls back to **every declared relation on the object**,
  denied ones included. So each of these components asked the server to resolve
  the object's full relation set by default, not by configuration — the
  ordinary shape of each surface, not a corner of it.
  
  **`PagePreview` is the one site where the judged principal is not the page's
  eventual audience.** It calls the browser's own `fetch` with
  `credentials: 'include'` rather than `DataSource.find`, so it runs under
  whichever session is loading the Studio preview. Gating on that same session's
  `usePermissions()` is still the correct principal: it is exactly the request
  the browser is about to make, on its own credentials, regardless of who later
  opens the published page.
  
  **Reproduced before it was fixed**, as a failing test per site (and, for the
  two sites — `ObjectView`, `PagePreview` — where the gate was implemented
  before its test was run red, a reverse-verification: the gate was reverted,
  all four denial-and-set pins on each went red, and the two deferral/positive
  control pins stayed green, before the gate was restored).
  
  **Grading, measured rather than assumed** — the same reading objectui#6898,
  #7215 and #7230 recorded: against ObjectStack's own server this is
  defence-in-depth, not a live disclosure. `plugin-security`'s
  `FieldMasker.maskRecord` deletes every unreadable key from each returned row
  and objectql's expand path writes the resolved record back under that same
  key, so one statement removes the expanded object and the bare id alike; the
  expansion sub-read is itself gated (the referenced object's full CRUD + RLS +
  FLS treatment, objectstack#7626). It is load-bearing for any backend that does
  not strip, and the client-request side is real regardless.
  
  **Nothing a permitted view did stops working.** The gate judges each site's
  `buildExpandFields` OUTPUT, which contains only the object's declared
  reference-bearing fields, so the "`checkField` answers false for an
  undeclared key" trap cannot be reached. An unanswered permission policy
  filters nothing. `buildExpandFields` itself is unchanged.
  
  `@object-ui/permissions` is added to `dependencies` for `plugin-kanban`,
  `plugin-tree`, `plugin-map`, `plugin-timeline`, and `plugin-view` — the fifth
  one objectui#7429's own dependency count missed (it named four); `plugin-list`
  and `app-shell` already had it.
- c6198c2: **Breaking for authored metadata:** `ComponentInput.label`, `ComponentInput.defaultValue` and
  `ComponentInput.advanced` are RETIRED on both faces (objectui#7493 item ① and objectui#7781;
  maintainer ruling A of 2026-09-06, immediate, no deprecation window; ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).
  They are the three keys the manifest serializer does not forward, and nothing read them on any
  publication or consumption path.
  
  No manifest ever published them, so no consumer could ever have read them. `sdui-parser`'s
  serializer (`packages/sdui-parser/src/index.ts`) forwards exactly six keys per input — `name`,
  `type`, `required`, `enum`, `binding`, `description` — so a value authored under any of the three
  never reached `sdui.manifest.json`, the generated JSX `.d.ts`, or a diagnostic; its boundary type
  has no slot for them; the registry's data-source seam reads `name` only; and neither the designer
  nor the app-shell inspectors consult registry `inputs` at all. A structural census over every
  `inputs:` array in the repository (re-measured on this change's merge-base, `name` 951 and `type`
  951 as the controls) counted the writes: `label` 908, `defaultValue` 245, `advanced` 9 — written on
  nearly every registration, read by nothing.
  
  FROM → TO, per key — all three **TOMBSTONED, not removed**, because the route was measured on
  the built face before it was chosen: `ComponentInputSchema` is a non-strict `z.object`, and an
  undeclared key parses GREEN and is silently STRIPPED, so a deletion would have swallowed 1,162
  authored values in silence. The tombstone is what makes the refusal loud and by name.
  
  - `label?: string` → `label?: never` on the interface, `retirementTombstone()` on the Zod mirror.
    Migration: delete the key. An input is identified by its `name` on every path that reaches it;
    nothing ever rendered a label for it.
  - `defaultValue?: any` → `defaultValue?: never` / `retirementTombstone()`. Migration: delete the
    key. The renderer's own fallback read IS the default; tell the author about it in `description`,
    which IS published. (Tightening the type to `unknown` was ruled out: it closes no error class,
    since nothing reads the value.)
  - `advanced?: boolean` → `advanced?: never` / `retirementTombstone()`. Migration: delete the key.
    No designer surface ever hid an "advanced" input; there is nothing to write instead.
  
  The retirement kit: `?: never` on `ComponentInput` (`packages/types/src/base.ts`), so authoring one
  is a `tsc` error at the registration site; `retirementTombstone()` on `ComponentInputSchema`
  (`packages/types/src/zod/base.zod.ts`), so an authored value is REFUSED at parse time with
  `code: 'invalid_type'`, the key named in the issue `path`, and the migration note as the message
  (one string, both channels). Pinned in
  `packages/types/src/__tests__/component-input-retired-keys-7493.test.ts`, which also holds a
  tree-scoped absence census over every `inputs:` array under `packages/**` and `apps/**`.
  
  Accept-set change, stated plainly for reviewers: a document that sets any of the three keys on a
  `ComponentInput` used to parse GREEN (the value was then dropped by the serializer) and now parses
  RED. Every in-repo authoring site — 1,199 keys across 110 registration files, the three standalone
  `ComponentInput[]` arrays and the two named input arrays `tsc` found included — is deleted in the same change, as the ruling's split rule
  requires; the `WidgetRegistry` seam no longer copies the widget-manifest values onto the synthesized
  `ComponentInput` (they fed nothing), and the data-source declaration `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT`
  drops its `label`. The patch entries on the other packages record exactly that: their registrations
  stop authoring inert keys, with no runtime or published-manifest change.
  
  The nine test files that read `defaultValue` off a registration were re-pinned against the
  renderer's ACTUAL default (its own fallback read, or the `defaultProps` it ships) instead of the
  declaration that went away; two assertions that only restated the shadow default were dropped with
  the reason on the line.
  
  The in-repo zero is what was measured. Whether anything OUTSIDE this repository writes these keys
  is not measurable from here (the objectui#5674 limit); converting such a write from a silent drop
  into a named refusal is exactly what the tombstones buy. `WidgetInput`'s own `label` /
  `defaultValue` / `advanced` (the widget-manifest face) stay declared and writable — nothing has
  ruled on that face; that it now has no reader either is recorded as objectui#7911.
- 37043cf: `ObjectTimeline` waits for the object definition instead of querying twice
  (objectui#7895).
  
  It was the last member of the set objectui#6482 converged on the shared
  settled-schema gate — `ObjectKanban`, `ObjectView`, `ObjectCalendar` and
  `ObjectTree` were named there, `ObjectGantt` was ask 2 of objectui#7225 — and
  nothing marked it a deliberate exclusion. It still held the object definition in
  a local `useState` fed by its own metadata effect, and listed that definition in
  the record-fetch effect's dependency array.
  
  **User-visible.** Every object-bound timeline load issued **two** `find` calls
  instead of one: the first before the definition landed, with `buildExpandFields`
  seeing no fields and therefore carrying no `$expand` at all, and a second one
  after. Whenever the metadata read is the slower of the two — the common case on
  a cold metadata cache — the second call is not merely a wasted round trip but a
  **three-step paint**: raw foreign-key ids, back to the loading skeleton (the
  effect's re-run calls `setLoading(true)` and `loading` is an early return), then
  the expanded rows. After this change the timeline paints once, from a query that
  already carries its expansion.
  
  Measured on the component with an instrumented renderer, one mount per hold,
  `getObjectSchema` held 0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/15/25/50/100 ms, with
  `ObjectCalendar` and `ObjectGantt` as positive controls in the same run: before,
  2 `find` calls with expand sets `[null, ['owner']]`, 1 paint at the readiness
  predicate and 3 late writes after it at every hold from +3 ms up; after, 1 `find`
  carrying `['owner']`, 1 paint, 0 late writes, and a first-paint time that tracks
  the hold (8 ms at +3, 30 ms at +25, 105 ms at +100) where before it was a flat
  3-7 ms at every hold. Both controls read 1 paint / 0 late writes before and
  after.
  
  The resolution half is now `useSettledSchema` from `@object-ui/react`, which
  settles on **every** exit — no source, no `getObjectSchema`, no object name, and
  a read that threw alike. That is what makes the gate safe: the replaced effect
  returned without settling on all four, which cost nothing while nothing waited on
  it and would have held a gated query open forever. Pinned by
  `ObjectTimeline.fetchGate-7895.test.tsx`, including a timeline whose adapter
  exposes no `getObjectSchema` and one whose definition read rejects — both still
  query, unexpanded.
  
  Unlike the two sibling conversions, the metadata read is **not** disabled for a
  timeline whose items were authored inline: this component also reads the
  definition's fields for option colours and field labels on that path, where no
  record query is issued at all.

### Minor Changes

- 01c9188: fix(plugin-timeline): dates follow the active locale instead of a hardcoded en-US

  A `zh` console rendered a fully Chinese timeline widget whose axis read
  `Aug 11` / `Sep 2026` and whose item dates read `August 11, 2026`
  (objectui#4513). `renderer.tsx` handed `Intl` a literal `'en-US'` at four sites
  — the hour, day and month gantt headers, and the `long` item date — so nothing
  a user or a tenant configured could reach them.

  A fifth site was the same defect spelled as an omission: the `short` item date
  called `toLocaleDateString()` with no tag at all, which means the _machine's_
  locale. It agreed with the other four only by the accident of an en-US runner,
  and rendered a third locale on anyone else's machine.

  All five now resolve through `useDisplayLocale()` from `@object-ui/i18n`
  (tenant regional default → active UI language → `en`) — the one channel every
  field, number and currency renderer already uses, converged there in
  objectui#4468. The locale is read once in `TimelineRenderer` and threaded into
  the two module-level date helpers, which cannot host a hook themselves.

  English output is byte-identical at all five sites: `'en'` and the retired
  `'en-US'` produce the same forms, and `generateTimeScaleHeaders` gained an
  optional trailing `locale` parameter that defaults to `'en'`, so existing
  three-argument callers are unaffected. The locale-free header vocabularies
  (`Week n`, `Qn YYYY`, `YYYY`) and all non-date rendering are untouched.

- 0082db8: The timeline's gantt bucket labels and its row-label default speak the session language

  objectui#4513 routed every `Intl` call in the timeline renderer through `useDisplayLocale()`, so a Chinese session renders `2026年8月` on the month axis and `2026年8月11日` on item dates. Three sibling strings in the same renderer never went through `Intl` at all and stayed English on that same Chinese axis: the `week` header (`Week 1`), the `quarter` header (`Q3 2026`), and the gantt row-label column default (`Items`). The half-fixed state was the visible one — a Chinese date axis with English bucket labels beside it.

  They are a translation concern rather than a locale-resolver one, and that distinction is the fix: a locale TAG formats a date, only a TRANSLATION spells a word. All three now resolve through the package's existing channel — `useTimelineTranslation` / `TIMELINE_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS`, the `createSafeTranslation` factory `ObjectTimeline` already uses for `timeline.bucket.*` — under three new keys carried by all ten locale packs: `timeline.scale.week`, `timeline.scale.quarter`, `timeline.gantt.rowLabel`.

  The week number and the quarter/year ride the channel's own `{{hole}}` parameters rather than being concatenated, because the word order belongs to the translation: Chinese puts the year first (`2026年第3季度`), which no `Q${q} ${year}` template can produce at all. Only the row-label DEFAULT moved — an author who writes `rowLabel` still supplies their own string, and the `year` scale stays a bare `String(getFullYear())` with no vocabulary in it to translate.

  English output is byte-identical to the retired literals: the `en` pack values are the same two templates the code used to interpolate by hand. `generateTimeScaleHeaders` is a pure exported function and cannot host a hook, so the translate fn is threaded in as an optional fifth parameter on the seam #4513 opened for `locale`, defaulting to the package's own defaults table — the same lookup the channel serves with no `I18nProvider` mounted. Existing three- and four-argument call sites are unaffected.

  One consequence is worth stating because it looks like a bug and is not: dates and vocabulary resolve through different channels on purpose. `useDisplayLocale()` puts the tenant's regional default first (how this organization writes dates), while `t` follows the UI language (what this user reads). A tenant configured `en` whose user reads Chinese chrome therefore sees `Aug 2026` beside `第 1 周` — the same split `timeline.bucket.*` has always had.

### Patch Changes

- 022002a: `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` now reaches the remaining object-bound public
  blocks: `object-gantt` / `object-timeline` / `object-map` / `object-pivot` /
  `object-master-detail-form` / `embeddable-form` / `record:line_items`
  (objectstack#7121).

  objectstack#6953 wired the spec's per-element data binding
  (`dataSource: { object, view?, filter?, sort?, limit? }`) to the eight blocks it
  named and left the same declaration inert on these seven. Each gates its fetch on
  its own object key and nothing mapped `dataSource.object` onto it, so a page
  written the way the spec documents rendered an empty gantt / an empty timeline
  rail / a map with no markers / an empty cross-tab / a field-less form — with no
  request and no diagnostic anywhere. Spec-valid metadata rendering nothing is the
  objectstack#4413 shape.

  Composition follows objectstack#5576's landed semantics unchanged, through the
  shared `ElementDataSourceGate` (no change to it or to the resolution layer): a
  named saved view supplies the baseline, a key written on the component itself
  overrides it, an explicit binding key overrides both, `filter` AND-combines
  ("additional filter criteria" — a binding can narrow a view, never widen it), and
  a `view` name that does not resolve renders a configuration error on every one of
  these blocks instead of degrading to the object's full scope.

  Each block maps **only** the keys it genuinely reads, which for this batch means
  several keys stay deliberately unmapped rather than being parked somewhere
  plausible:

  - `object-gantt` and `object-map` take `object` / `filter` / `sort`; neither has a
    row cap or a field-list read site.
  - `object-pivot` takes `object` / `filter`; a cross-tab orders itself by its own
    row/column grouping and cannot be computed over a truncated page.
  - `object-timeline` takes `object` only — its fetch is
    `find(objectName, { options: { $top: 100 } })`, with no filter/sort read site
    at all, so a named view is error-checked and then contributes nothing.
  - `embeddable-form` and `object-master-detail-form` take `object` only (the
    parent object, in the master-detail case); a form that writes one record has no
    collection query for `filter` / `sort` / `limit` to narrow.
  - `record:line_items` takes `object` onto **`childObject`** — the collection it
    actually lists — and nothing else: its query is the parent FK plus a fixed
    `$top: 500`, and its `columns` are editable `GridColumn` objects rather than a
    field-name projection a view could supply.

  The per-block coverage table, including every residual gap named above, is in
  `content/docs/guide/data-source.md`.

  No behaviour change for a block that carries no `dataSource`: the binding-free
  path returns the schema by reference, so nothing remounts and nothing refetches.

- 523be48: `object-timeline` and `record:line_items` now apply the filter / sort / row cap they are given, so a named `dataSource.view` narrows them instead of contributing nothing

  These were the two residual gaps in objectstack#7121's per-block coverage table
  (objectstack#7137). Both blocks are object-bound lists, both accepted the spec's
  per-element `dataSource` binding, and neither had a read site for `filter` or
  `sort` anywhere in its fetch:

  - `object-timeline`'s entire query was
    `find(objectName, { options: { $top: 100 } })`.
  - `record:line_items`' was the parent FK plus a fixed `$top: 500`.

  So `dataSource: { object, view: 'hot' }` resolved the view — a typo still reported
  a configuration error, it never degraded into an unfiltered query — and then
  dropped everything the view said. The rendered rows could be **wider than the view
  they named**, silently, which is exactly the class of mistake AI-authored metadata
  hides best: the page looks like it works. objectstack#7121 deliberately left the
  keys unmapped and recorded the gap rather than writing composed values onto schema
  keys nobody read; this closes it at the fetch instead.

  What each block now reads:

  - **`object-timeline`** — `$filter: schema.filter`,
    `$orderby: convertSortToQueryParams(schema.sort)`, and
    `$top: schema.limit ?? 100`, matching the form `object-gantt` / `object-map` /
    `object-calendar` already use. Its registry mapping gains
    `filter` / `sort` / `limit`; `columns` stays unmapped, because a timeline
    projects the fields its `timeline` config names.
  - **`record:line_items`** — the composed filter is **AND-combined** with the parent
    relationship condition through `mergeFilterNodes`, never substituted for it, the
    same way `record:related_list` composes its own since objectstack#7118: a
    line-items panel is always scoped to the record it sits on, so an _additional_
    criterion can only narrow this parent's children and can never surface another
    parent's rows. `sort` becomes the load order and `limit` the row cap (default
    500). `columns` stays unmapped — here they are `GridColumn[]` driving an editable
    grid, not a field-name projection, so a view's column list would be the wrong
    _shape_ rather than merely a wider answer.

  **Behaviour change worth knowing about:** the timeline's default window is now a
  real cap. `{ options: { $top: 100 } }` nested the limit under a key that is not a
  `QueryParams` field and that no adapter in this repo reads (`convertQueryParams`
  maps `params.$top`), so the intended window never reached the wire and a timeline
  over a large object fetched whatever the server chose to return. It is now sent as
  `$top`, and authorable via `limit` or a view's `pagination.pageSize`.

  `@object-ui/core` gains `convertSortToQueryParams`, the sort→`$orderby` lowering
  the three sibling blocks each inline privately. It is shared rather than copied
  twice more, and is slightly more faithful to the declared contract than those
  copies: a sort entry that omits `order` means ascending instead of being dropped
  (the string spelling `"amount"` already meant ascending in the same copies), and
  nothing orderable yields `undefined` rather than a truthy empty `{}`. Migrating
  the three existing copies onto it is objectstack#7148 and is not done here.

### Minor Changes

- 5cb75b3: fix(timeline,list): the timeline honours `timeline.dateField`, not just `timeline.startDateField` (#3129)

  `dateField` is the pre-#2231 alias for `startDateField`. `@object-ui/types`
  declares it on the nested config (`ListViewTimelineConfig`), and both
  `ObjectView` read-sites (app-shell and plugin-view) resolve it — but the two
  read-sites that actually drive the axis did not:

  - `ObjectTimeline` consulted the alias only on the FLAT prop (`schema.dateField`),
    never on the nested `schema.timeline`.
  - `ListView` resolved it out of `options.timeline` but not out of the
    spec-canonical `schema.timeline` — including in the capability gate, so such a
    view could fail to offer the Timeline option at all.

  So a view authored as `timeline: { dateField: 'start_date' }` — the spec nesting
  with the legacy key — fell through to the caller's default (`created_at` /
  `due_date`). That field is normally absent from the `$select` projection, so
  every record came back without it and the timeline rendered all of them under
  **No date** — while the configured date was sitting in the row untouched. That
  also explains why widening the view's projection changed nothing: the projection
  already carried the right field; the renderer was reading a different one.

  Both read-sites now resolve the alias in the same precedence position they
  already use for `options.timeline.dateField`. The spec key still wins wherever
  both appear. Observable rendering change (records move out of "No date" into
  real date buckets), hence `minor`.

### Patch Changes

- 7d46648: fix(hooks): stop calling translation hooks inside try/catch (objectui#2879)

  Eleven call sites wrapped a React hook in `try`/`catch` to make it
  "provider-safe". `useObjectTranslation` and `useObjectLabel` already are — they
  read context optionally and fall back to react-i18next's global instance, and
  never throw. The `catch` bought nothing and cost correctness: a throw _after_
  the hook ran desyncs hook order on the next render, because React matches hooks
  positionally. objectui#2595/#2596 fixed exactly this in `@object-ui/i18n`'s
  `createSafeTranslation`; nine plugin-local re-implementations kept their own
  copy of the bug, and two more (`ObjectTimeline`, `ObjectView`) were found by the
  new lint rule below — `ObjectView` had even suppressed
  `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` inline to keep it.

  - Six exact re-implementations now delegate to `createSafeTranslation`:
    `plugin-detail`, `plugin-timeline`, `plugin-list`, `plugin-calendar`,
    `plugin-grid`'s `ObjectGrid`, `plugin-designer`.
  - `components`' `data-table` also delegates; `createSafeTranslation` now
    returns `language` alongside `t` so consumers that localize dates don't need
    a second hook call. Purely additive.
  - `plugin-gantt` and `plugin-grid`'s `ImportWizard` keep their local hooks —
    they fall back _per key_, which a single-probe factory cannot express and
    which their comments justify (a host dictionary that covers common keys but
    lags on newer ones). Only the `try`/`catch` is removed.
  - `ObjectTimeline` and `ObjectView` call the hook directly and probe the
    returned value, mirroring `useSafeFieldLabel`.

  Adds `object-ui/no-try-catch-around-hook` (error) so a twelfth copy fails CI.
  It only matches `use*` names, accepts member calls solely on `React` (so
  `vi.useRealTimers()` is not a hook), and resets its try-depth inside nested
  functions (so `renderHook(() => useThing())` inside a `try` is fine) — both
  false positives were real code in this repo and are pinned in the rule's tests.

  `eslint-rules/**/*.test.js` matched no vitest project glob, so the local
  plugin's specs had never run in CI. They are now included; all three pass.

  `ObjectTimeline`'s test mock of `@object-ui/react` omitted `useObjectLabel` —
  the removed `try`/`catch` had been silently absorbing that gap. The mock is now
  complete.

## 16.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 7cf4051: chore(deps): align every `@objectstack/*` dependency to `^16.0.0-rc.0`

  Bumps `@objectstack/spec` / `client` / `formula` / `lint` from `^15.1.1` to the
  `16.0.0-rc.0` pre-release across the workspace (root + `apps/console` +
  `apps/site` + all consuming packages). ObjectUI's own packages are already on
  major 16, so this closes the 15↔16 skew between ObjectUI and the `@objectstack`
  contract libraries (which publish in lockstep with `spec`).

  This is a dependency alignment, not a behavioral migration: the full workspace
  build (43/43) and the `@objectstack`-consuming package test suites
  (`core` / `app-shell` / `data-objectstack` / `plugin-form` / `types`) are green
  against `16.0.0-rc.0` with no source changes required.

  Practical effect: `@objectstack/client@16.0.0-rc.0` now ships
  `data.batchTransaction` (framework #3271), so `ObjectStackAdapter`'s feature
  detect (`typeof client.data.batchTransaction === 'function'`) routes
  master-detail cross-object saves through the typed SDK method instead of the
  raw `fetch('/api/v1/batch')` fallback — realizing the "verify SDK path" half of
  #2694. The raw-fetch branch stays as a defensive fallback (removal tracked in
  #2694).

- 549c67d: chore(lint): clear the mechanical baseline lint errors so these packages' lint gates protect them again

  Extends the fields/core cleanup from #2709 (objectui#2713). These eight package
  lints were red at baseline on `main`, so their per-package `lint` gate could not
  catch new violations of the same class. Cleared every **error** (no behavior
  change; warnings are out of scope):

  - **`no-useless-catch`** (`data-objectstack`) — unwrapped five try/catch blocks
    whose `catch` only re-threw; errors still propagate identically.
  - **`preserve-caught-error`** (`cli`, `data-objectstack`, `react`) — the caught
    error's message is inlined into the thrown `Error`; a scoped disable with a
    justifying comment carries each one, because these packages target ES2020
    whose lib types the 1-arg `Error` constructor only (so `{ cause }` won't
    compile) — same reasoning as the core case in #2709.
  - **`prefer-const`** (`plugin-calendar`, `plugin-map`) — `let`→`const` for
    never-reassigned bindings.
  - **`no-empty-object-type`** (`plugin-designer`) — empty extend-only interfaces
    → equivalent `type` aliases.
  - **`no-useless-assignment`** (`react`) — dropped a dead initializer that both
    branches overwrite before it is read.
  - **`no-require-imports`** (`plugin-calendar`, `plugin-timeline` tests) —
    hoisted `vi.mock` factories now use an `async` factory with
    `await import('react')` instead of `require('react')`.
  - **stale `eslint-disable` directive** (`plugin-markdown`) — removed a
    `react/no-danger` disable whose plugin is not loaded in the flat config (an
    unknown-rule reference that ESLint v10 reports as an error); the rationale is
    kept as a plain comment.

  - Rename deprecated `flex-shrink-0` → `shrink-0` and `flex-grow-N` →
    `grow-N` (Tailwind v4 dropped the long-form aliases). Affects
    data-table, fields/index, FileField, ChatbotEnhanced,
    FloatingChatbotPanel, ProcessDesigner, HistoryPanel, KanbanEnhanced,
    KanbanImpl, plugin-timeline index, FlowDesigner, LayoutRenderer.
  - Replace `theme(spacing.4)` inside arbitrary-value `[calc(...)]` with
    literal `1rem` in sidebar.tsx — `theme()` is deprecated in v4.
  - Remove obsolete v3-escape CSS overrides from index.css and
    sidebar-fixes.css. The component source now uses native v4 stacked
    data variants (`group-data-[state=collapsed]:group-data-[collapsible=icon]:w-(--sidebar-width-icon)`)
    which Tailwind v4 emits correctly without the manual overrides.
    Only the bespoke `.sidebar-menu-button-icon-mode*` rules are kept.

## 4.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 1dc6061: fix(build): inline dynamic imports in library outputs

  Library `vite build --lib` outputs were emitting separate code-split chunks
  (`rolldown-runtime-*.js`, `LookupField-*.js`, etc.) when source files used
  `React.lazy()` / dynamic `import()`. When consumer apps re-bundled these
  multi-file dists, the library's per-chunk rolldown-runtime collided with the
  consumer's own runtime, causing "TypeError: i is not a function" at runtime
  when lazy components tried to register themselves (e.g. TextField in
  `@object-ui/fields` after 4.0.4).

  Adding `output.inlineDynamicImports: true` to all `@object-ui/*` library vite
  configs forces a single `dist/index.js` per package, which lets consumer
  bundlers handle the library as an opaque ESM module without identifier
  mismatches across chunks.

  Affected packages: components, fields, layout, plugin-aggrid, plugin-ai,
  plugin-calendar, plugin-charts, plugin-chatbot, plugin-dashboard,
  plugin-designer, plugin-detail, plugin-editor, plugin-form, plugin-gantt,
  plugin-grid, plugin-kanban, plugin-list, plugin-map, plugin-markdown,
  plugin-report, plugin-timeline, plugin-view, plugin-workflow.

## 4.0.4

### Patch Changes

- d2b6ece: fix: externalize all bare imports in library builds

  Library builds (vite lib mode) now externalize every non-relative import instead of bundling third-party CJS dependencies into the published dist. This avoids inlined `require("react")` / `require("react-dom")` calls that cause `Calling \`require\` for "react" in an environment that doesn't expose the \`require\` function` runtime errors when consumer apps re-bundle the published dist.

  Specifically fixes:

  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` no longer inlines `react-grid-layout` (and its transitive `react-draggable` / `react-resizable` CJS bundles). `react-grid-layout` is now declared as a peer dependency so consumers install a single ESM-friendly copy.
  - `@object-ui/components`, `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/plugin-charts`, `@object-ui/plugin-designer` no longer inline `react-i18next` / `i18next` / `use-sync-external-store` CJS shims.
  - All plugin packages now use a unified `external: (id) => !/^[./]/.test(id) && !id.startsWith(__dirname)` rule, ensuring future additions of CJS deps are automatically externalized.

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).

### Patch Changes

- b2be122: fix(mobile): round 2 — kanban readability, calendar default view, timeline dot clipping

  **Kanban**

  - Remove `font-mono` from card titles, descriptions, column headers, and empty-state labels — CRM cards no longer render in a monospace font.
  - Constrain column body height (`max-h-full min-h-0` + `h-full` on the layout root) so `ScrollArea` activates and cards don't bleed past the viewport bottom.
  - Opportunistically derive `description` (e.g. `$60K · Acme Corp · @owner`) and up to two `badges` (priority/severity/industry/rating) in `ObjectKanban` when the schema/source omits them, giving mobile cards more context at a glance.

  **Calendar**

  - `ObjectCalendar` previously hardcoded `view={schema.defaultView ?? 'month'}`, making the view-selector dropdown a no-op. Wire the `view` state through to the `<Calendar>` prop so user selection is respected.
  - On mobile (viewport < 768 px) coerce `day` defaults to `month` via a synchronous lazy initialiser and a resize/orientation effect — avoids the useless 24-hour empty-hour grid for date-only events.

  **Timeline**

  - Add `ml-3` to the `<Timeline>` `<ol>` so the `absolute -left-3` marker dots are no longer clipped at the scroll-container edge.
