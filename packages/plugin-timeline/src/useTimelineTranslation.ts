  // the wrong way round. `{{path}}` is the authored location

  // reduce an empty list and throw `RangeError: Invalid time value` mid-render.
  // The maintainer ruling (2026-08-29) chose to refuse loudly rather than to
  // compose rows from records, so this string IS the feature on that path and

  // axis, the twin of `ObjectGantt`'s "Gantt configuration required" screen.

  // It became REACHABLE in the same change that retired the renderer's own
  // invented field name from the end of the resolver chain; before that a name
  // always resolved and this string could never have rendered. House posture
  // (maintainer, 2026-09-01, 总监批 #28): 日期轴永不虚构 — a date axis is
  // never fabricated.
