/**
 * objectui#10159 — the `INHERITED_TARGET` docblock quotes the resolver's read,
 * and this file is what keeps it quoting a read that exists.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The docblock above `INHERITED_TARGET` in `ActionPreview` tells its reader
 * where a field-backed picker's real target comes from at runtime, and it does
 * so by QUOTING the resolver's expression. objectui#6837 narrowed that read in
 * `resolveActionParam` to the one spelling the protocol declares,
 * `field.reference`; the quotation was not narrowed with it and kept naming
 * `field.reference_to`. That is more than a stale comment: `@objectstack/spec`
 * refuses `reference_to` on a field definition BY NAME (`unrecognized_keys`,
 * with the rename to `reference` as the suggestion), so a reader who took the
 * comment at its word would author a key the platform rejects.
 *
 * ## Why the assertion is shaped this way
 *
 *  1. **The quotation is re-derived from the docblock, never transcribed
 *     here.** A pin that restated the expected expression would be a second
 *     copy of the claim, free to rot alongside the first. The only thing this
 *     file knows is WHERE to look: the backtick span in that docblock that
 *     starts `referenceTo:`.
 *  2. **It is looked for in the resolver's CODE, with comments masked** by the
 *     shared `scripts/js-comment-mask.mjs` — the resolver's own comments
 *     discuss `reference_to` at length, and a match over raw text could be
 *     satisfied by prose about a read rather than by the read.
 *  3. **At a token boundary, not as a substring.** A plain `includes` would
 *     accept a docblock quoting `field.reference` against code that reads
 *     `field.reference_to` — this defect's mirror image. The DISCRIMINATOR case
 *     pins that the boundary refuses a prefix.
 *  4. **Whitespace is compared collapsed on both sides,** so re-wrapping the
 *     docblock or re-formatting the code moves nothing; only a change of
 *     tokens does.
 *
 * The CONTROL case proves the instrument is lit: the same reader, mask and
 * boundary FIND every `referenceTo:` read the resolver really has. Without it
 * the main assertion's red could mean a blind instrument as easily as a wrong
 * quotation.
 *
 * Cited by content — symbol names and quoted strings — and never by line
 * address (AGENTS.md #11): the absence of that discipline is how this
 * quotation drifted without anyone seeing it.
