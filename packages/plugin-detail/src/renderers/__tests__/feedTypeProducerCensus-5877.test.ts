 *
 * The producer census behind the unproduced-kind diagnostic (objectui#5877).
 *
 * `PRODUCED_FEED_TYPES` is derived from `ACTIVITY_TYPE_TO_FEED_TYPE` plus one
 * DECLARED entry — `FEED_TYPES_PRODUCED_OFF_MAP` — for the producer that lives
 * in a package this one cannot import (app-shell depends on plugin-detail, not
 * the other way round). A declared list is exactly the thing that goes stale
 * without anyone noticing, and a diagnostic reading a stale census does not fall
 * silent: it starts naming kinds that DO have a producer, which trains authors
 * to ignore it. So the census is re-run here, from source, over the repository.
 *
 * ## ⭐ A census is only as wide as its pathspec, so the pathspec is asserted
 *
 * This card's family was handed a too-narrow census three times, the last one
 * missing a fourth copy sitting one package outside the grep's path. The
 * defence is not a wider grep — it is a scan whose WIDTH is itself checked:
 * the coverage assertions below fail if the walk stops finding the tree, so a
 * scan that silently narrows cannot pass by finding nothing.
 *
 * PATHSPEC: every `.ts` / `.tsx` file under the repository root, at every top
 * level (`packages/`, `apps/`, `examples/`, `scripts/`, `e2e/`, …), excluding
 * build output (`dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `node_modules/`) and dotted
 * directories, then excluding tests (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/`) —
 * a test fixture is not a producer of anything an author sees.
 *
 * NOT included, and each for a stated reason:
 *  - `.mdx` documentation. `content/docs/plugins/plugin-detail.mdx` builds
 *    example `FeedItem`s, but a documentation example produces nothing at
 *    runtime. (Both kinds it names are produced anyway, so the exclusion does
 *    not hide a producer.)
 *  - the `ActivityItem` surface — see the explicit exclusion test below.
