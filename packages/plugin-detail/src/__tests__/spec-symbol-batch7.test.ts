/**
 * `@object-ui/plugin-detail` ↔ `@objectstack/spec` symbol-collision guards
 * (objectui#3161, objectstack#4115 ledger batch 7).
 *
 *  - `FeedFilterMode` was a hand copy of the spec's four-member enum under the
 *    spec's own name, in a file that already imported the sibling
 *    `FeedItemType` from the spec vocabulary. It is a re-export now, pinned
 *    below by TYPE IDENTITY (not by listing the four members again — a test
 *    that restates the copy cannot detect the copy).
 *
 *  - `ObjectFieldLike` → `ObjectDefFieldLike`. This is the case the guard's
 *    header calls "the SPEC export is the imprecise one": the spec's
 *    `ObjectFieldLike` ends in `[key: string]: any`, so deriving from it would
 *    have traded a precise three-key layout contract for a bag. The pin below
 *    states that reason as a fact, so the day the spec tightens its declaration
 *    the reason expires loudly instead of silently.
