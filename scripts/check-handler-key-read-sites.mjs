/**
 * Every `on*` handler key a REGISTERED renderer reads off the authored document
 * must be a DECLARED member of the zod arm for the type it is registered under.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-handler-key-read-sites.mjs   (also `pnpm check:handler-key-reads`)
 *       node scripts/check-handler-key-read-sites.mjs --list   (every read site this gate judged)
 * Exit: 0 = every reachable `schema.onX` / `props.onX` read is a declared arm member,
 *       1 = at least one is not, or the census collapsed.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes (objectui#7753, the class card of objectui#7664 / PR #7743)
 *
 * `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`. A key that LEAVES an arm is therefore not
 * refused — it stops being judged and the value is KEPT. Measured on the built
 * dist at the head that carried it:
 *
 *   { type: 'kanban', columns: [], onCardClick: { action: 'toast' } }
 *     before the deletion : REFUSED
 *     after the deletion  : ACCEPTED, with {"action":"toast"} surviving into
 *                           the parsed output — and `KanbanRenderer` still
 *                           forwarding `schema.onCardClick` into the board.
 *
 * Every gate stayed green. The #6124 ledger
 * (`packages/types/src/__tests__/handler-keys-json-refusal-6124.test.ts`) is two
 * hand-written arrays of `[file, schema, key, mirror]` tuples plus a length
 * assertion, so its POPULATION IS A LITERAL: the change re-keyed the arm by
 * SUBSTITUTION (an `onQuickAdd` tuple replacing the `onCardClick` one), which
 * held `RUNTIME_SLOT` at 44 and `ALL_SITES` at 66. A count ratchet could not
 * have seen it, and the type-level `KeepsFunction` / `RetiredIsNever` blocks are
 * written per key, so a deleted pair simply stops being asserted.
 *
 * That file's own docblock warns about this hazard — but its counter-probe pins
 * the passthrough BEHAVIOUR on a fixture. Nothing pinned the ledger's MEMBERSHIP
 * to the renderers. This gate is that missing derivation, generalised off
 * `packages/plugin-kanban/src/__tests__/kanban-handler-slots-7664.test.tsx`,
 * whose suite 3 does exactly this for one arm and whose population is derived.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in `scripts/` and not in `@object-ui/types`
 *
 * The read-site half is spread across `@object-ui/plugin-*` and
 * `packages/components`. `@object-ui/types` may not import them —
 * `pnpm check:phantom-deps` rejects the dependency and it would close a cycle —
 * so the only place that can read both halves at once is a repo-level script.
 *
 * ## The census, stated as a rule
 *
 * Both populations are DERIVED. Nothing here is a list a re-key can hold
 * constant.
 *
 *   ARMS      every `type: z.literal('<t>')` object literal reachable from an
 *             exported `const` in `packages/types/src/zod/*.zod.ts`, with the
 *             members it declares (unioned along `.extend()` bases resolved in
 *             the same directory) and, for members built by
 *             `handlerKeyRefusal(key, disposition, …)`, that disposition.
 *   READS     for every real `ComponentRegistry.register('<t>', C, …)` CALL in
 *             `packages/<pkg>/src`: the `schema.onX` / `<props>.onX` property
 *             accesses inside `C`'s body, plus those inside every component `C`
 *             RENDERS that is declared in the same package (JSX element names,
 *             resolved through same-file declarations and static relative
 *             imports, transitively, with a visited set). A TYPE-ONLY wrapper on
 *             the expression that hands the document over — `schema={bound as
 *             DetailViewSchema}` — does not close that hop (objectui#9700): it
 *             erases, so the child is handed the same object either way.
 *   KEYING    a registration is keyed on the type keys it CLAIMS, which is what
 *             the third argument decides and ⛔ not what the type string spells
 *             (objectui#9573): `register()` in `@object-ui/core`'s `Registry`
 *             sets `ns:type`, and sets the bare `type` key only when a
 *             namespaced registration omits `skipFallback`. A namespaced-only
 *             alias is therefore judged against the arm of `ns:type` — never the
 *             bare arm, which is the key `skipFallback` exists to leave alone.
 *   FINDING   a read key at a type that HAS an arm, where the arm does not
 *             declare that key (`undeclared`), or declares it with the RETIRED
 *             disposition while a renderer still reads it (`retired-but-read`).
 *
 * The transitive hop is not a flourish: it is the shape of the very instance
 * this gate exists for. `'kanban'` registers `ObjectKanbanRenderer`, which
 * renders `ObjectKanban`, which renders `KanbanRenderer` — and `KanbanRenderer`
 * is where `schema.onCardClick` is read. A gate reading only the registered
 * component's own body is green on objectui#7664's deletion, which is the one
 * reading that would make it worthless.
 *
 * ⚠️ And a hop lost is worse than a read lost, which is why objectui#9700 is a
 * card of its own rather than a second helping of objectui#9344. A read this
 * gate cannot see still leaves its component in the census; a HOP it cannot take
 * removes the component entirely — no finding, no census row, no ledger row —
 * and the green then reads as "no undeclared reads" over a file never opened.
 * objectui#9447 stood in exactly that state: `register('detail-view',
 * DetailViewRenderer)` stopped at the data-source gate because the render-prop
 * child is handed `bound as DetailViewSchema`, and two undeclared keys were read
 * on a live call path while this gate exited 0 over them.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT answer
 *
 * Each of these is a boundary, not an oversight:
 *
 *   1. **Keys that reach a renderer ONLY through a `{...props}` spread onto a
 *      Radix root or a DOM listener slot.** The seven `onOpenChange` overlays,
 *      `accordion` / `collapsible` / `toggle-group` / `tabs`, `button`'s
 *      `toFormControlDomProps` whitelist and `card`'s `<Card {...cardProps}>`
 *      reach the element without ever naming the key. There is no read site to
 *      derive from, so this gate says nothing about them; the #6124 ledger and
 *      `check-action-forward-parity.mjs` are what cover that channel.
 *   2. **The 22 RETIRED tombstones.** A tombstone exists precisely because
 *      nothing reads the key — it has no read site BY CONSTRUCTION, so it
 *      cannot be derived from one. What this gate does add there is the other
 *      direction: if a renderer ever starts reading a tombstoned key, that is a
 *      `retired-but-read` finding.
 *   3. **Types with no zod arm.** `'kanban-ui'`, `'kanban-enhanced'`,
 *      `'notifications'`, `'approvals'` and the rest of the app-shell surface
 *      are registered without a mirror. An arm that does not exist cannot have
 *      lost a member, and inventing an obligation there would be a different
 *      card. ⚠️ A namespaced-only alias over a type whose BARE key does have an
 *      arm falls here too — `view:list`, `action:button`, `page:tabs` — and
 *      because that is the shape objectui#9573 was mis-judging, its reads are
 *      still REPORTED, as UNMIRRORED-ALIAS census rows carrying the bare arm
 *      they are not. They are countable and `--list`-able; they are ⛔ not
 *      findings, and the way to bring them into judgement is to mirror the
 *      namespaced key, ⛔ never to declare the key on the bare arm.
 *   4. **Whether a declared key's TYPE is right.** That is the #6124 ledger's
 *      `KeepsFunction` / `RetiredIsNever` blocks, and it needs a type checker.
 *   5. **Lazy chunks.** `React.lazy(() => import('./KanbanImpl'))` is a dynamic
 *      import, not a statically resolvable component reference. Following it
 *      would mean guessing at a module graph the type checker owns.
 *
 * ## Rollout
 *
 * `KNOWN_UNDECLARED_READS` below is an EXEMPTION list, never the population, and
 * it only shrinks. ⚠️ Its size is a LOWER BOUND on the defects this gate can
 * see, never a measure of them: a read that passes for a coincidental reason
 * leaves no row at all, which is how `'form' FormSchema.onCancel` passed until
 * objectui#9573 re-keyed the census. Every row is a live defect with a card, not a waiver: a row
 * naming a read site this gate can no longer find FAILS the gate, the same
 * `KNOWN_HAND_SPELLINGS` rule PR #7789 landed. Its rows are the gate's own first
 * findings — arms whose renderer reads a key the mirror never declared, which is
 * the same passthrough exposure objectui#7753 names, standing on `main` before
 * this gate could see it. They are ledgered rather than fixed here because every
 * fix is a `packages/<pkg>/src` change and this card is Clause-② `no`.

  //
  // ⭐ ALL SEVEN `data-table::DataTableSchema` rows, the one
  // `tree-view::TreeViewSchema.onNodeClick` row, all five
  // `object-form::ObjectFormSchema` rows, `object-grid::ObjectGridSchema.onNavigate`,

  // `list-view::ListViewSchema` rows, both `object-gallery::ObjectGallerySchema`
  // rows and `object-view::ObjectViewSchema.onNavigate` LANDED and are gone.
  // They are objectui#6124 RUNTIME SLOTS on their arms, each measured at its OWN
  // channel rather than assumed from its siblings — which is why the slices
  // could not be co-disposed: `onColumnResize` has NO host prop anywhere
  // (`ObjectGrid` supplies its own closure), `onStepChange` has no in-repo
  // supplier at all while its channel is wired end to end, and `onRowClick` has
  // three suppliers at once. `object-kanban::ObjectKanbanSchema.onCardMove` went
  // with objectui#9342 the other way: its disposition IS `'retired'`, and this
  // gate refused that spelling while `KanbanRenderer` still read the key, so the
  // read moved to an explicit React prop first and the arm then took the
  // tombstone. Draining a row is part of the landing, not cleanup after it: a
  // row that outlived its read reddens `staleExemptions()` below.
  //
  // ⭐⭐ THE THIRTEEN ALIAS-SHAPE ROWS LEFT THIS LEDGER WITH objectui#9573, and
  // ⛔ none of them left by being declared. They left because they were never
  // this component's rows: `button::ButtonSchema.onSuccess`,
  // `icon::IconSchema.onSuccess`, `tabs::TabsSchema.onTabChange`, the four
  // `form::FormSchema` rows, `grid::GridSchema.onNavigate` and the five
  // `list::ListSchema` rows were produced by a census that keyed a registration
  // on its RAW TYPE STRING. Each of the six registrations behind them carries
  // `skipFallback: true` under a namespace — `action:button`, `action:icon`,
  // `page:tabs`, `view:form`, `view:grid`, `view:list` — and `skipFallback` is
  // precisely what stops a namespaced alias claiming the bare key, as
  // `@object-ui/plugin-list`'s own registration comment says: "the bare `list`
  // key belongs to the bullet/numbered list DISPLAY primitive (`ui:list` in
  // `@object-ui/components`)". So the arm each row named — a bullet list, a
  // Shadcn button, the `ui:tabs` container — belonged to a DIFFERENT component,
  // and declaring the key there would have published a density handler on a
  // bullet list and an action's post-success navigation block on a plain button.
  // The registry's rule is in `register()` in `@object-ui/core`'s `Registry`,
  // and `registrationsIn` now reads it: the bare key is claimed only when a
  // namespaced registration omits `skipFallback`.
  //
  // ⚠️ The ten `form` / `grid` / `list` reads did NOT leave the census. Those
  // same read sites are still judged, under the registration that claims a
  // MIRRORED key — `object-form`, `object-grid`, `list-view` — where they are
  // declared runtime slots. What left is a SECOND, wrong scoring of them. The
  // other three (`action:button`, `action:icon`, `page:tabs`) have no second
  // registration, so their reads are now reported as UNMIRRORED-ALIAS census
  // rows: real reads under a type key no mirror carries an arm for, which is
  // boundary 3 above and ⛔ not a finding this gate can make.
  //
  // ⚠️ And the same re-keying removed a FALSE GREEN the ledger could never have
  // shown, because a wrongly-passing read leaves no row: `'form'
  // FormSchema.onCancel` passed only because `FormSchema` — the `ui:form`
  // primitive's arm — mints its own `onCancel` for its own destructure, and the
  // two spellings coincided. It is now scored once, on `object-form`, where the
  // read actually lives.
  //
  // ⛔ `detail::DetailSchema.onTabChange` is NOT that shape and stays. Its
  // registration is `register('detail', DetailView, { namespace: 'view',
  // category: 'view' })` — ⛔ no `skipFallback`, so it DOES claim the bare
  // `detail` key and `DetailSchema` IS its arm. Its disposition is still
  // UNDECIDED and owned by objectui#7804, the card the row carries, which is the
  // only owner anything in this map routes to. It was objectui#9344's item ②
  // while that card was open; objectui#9344 closed `completed` on 2026-09-13
  // having landed its item ① (the cast receiver this census now peels) and not
  // its item ②, so prose sending a reader there sends them to a closed card —
  // the defect objectui#9456 repaired. ⛔ Nothing here says it is decided, and
  // deciding it lands in the zod arm, not in this file.

  // ⭐ objectui#9700 — THE ROW THE BLIND SPOT WAS HIDING, and ⚠️ the ONE row in
  // this map that arrived by the gate seeing MORE rather than by a renderer
  // gaining a read. It is the SAME read site as the row above,
  // `DetailView.tsx`'s `(schema as any).onTabChange`, scored a second time
  // — correctly — under the OTHER registration that reaches that component:
  // `register('detail-view', DetailViewRenderer, { namespace: 'plugin-detail' })`
  // omits `skipFallback`, so it claims the bare `detail-view` key and
  // `DetailViewSchema` IS its arm. Until objectui#9700 peeled the cast off the
  // hop, the walk stopped at `ElementDataSourceGate` and this component was
  // never opened under that registration at all.
  //
  // ⛔ It is NOT a waiver bought to make a widening quiet, and the difference is
  // checkable rather than asserted: the defect this row names is the authored
  // `onTabChange` that `BaseSchemaCore`'s `.passthrough()` KEEPS on a
  // `detail-view` node and hands to a read site typing it
  // `((value: string) => void) | undefined`. objectui#9447's own measurement is
  // why the channel is known to survive the wrapper: `useElementDataSourceSchema`
  // returns the node unchanged when there is no composed binding and otherwise
  // shallow-spreads it, overwriting only the binding keys — `onTabChange` is not
  // one of them.
  //
  // ⚠️ The number of live undeclared READ SITES did not move: it is one line,
  // and it was one line before. What moved is how many of the two registrations
  // that reach it this gate can score — one, now both. The fix is the same fix,
  // owned by the same card: objectui#7804 decides the disposition, and deciding
  // it lands in the zod arm, never in this file.
