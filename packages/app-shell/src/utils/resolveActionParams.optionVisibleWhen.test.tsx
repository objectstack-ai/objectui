/**
 * objectui#3559, end to end: a field's per-option `visibleWhen` narrows the
 * option list a dialog param actually renders.
 *
 * The unit half lives in `resolveActionParams.test.ts` (the resolved param keeps
 * the keys, and `resolveVisibleOptions()` filters on them). What that cannot show
 * is the CONSUMER half — whether the control the dialog builds evaluates the
 * predicate at all, or merely receives it. So this file drives the real widget
 * with the real field object, wired the way `ActionParamDialog` wires it:
 *
 *   field metadata → `resolveActionParams()` → `paramToField()` → `<SelectField>`
 *
 * `ActionParamDialog` renders `field={paramToField(param)}` and `id={param.name}`
 * through `getLazyFieldWidget(field.type)`; `SelectField` is what that resolves
 * to for a `select` param. It is imported here at MODULE scope rather than through
 * the lazy registry on purpose (AGENTS.md §测试纪律): a first dynamic `import()`
 * under a saturated transform pipeline can eat most of RTL's 1s budget, and the
 * assertions below are synchronous effects.
 *
 * Most cases below pass no `dependentValues`, which is now the NON-dialog wiring:
 * since objectui#3765 the dialog supplies its own in-progress values on that prop,
 * so a widget reached without one is a widget outside a dialog (the object form
 * before it threads the record, hand-written SDUI, the inline editor). Those cases
 * therefore exercise the predicates that need no record at all — scope-relative
 * (`current_user`), the role-gating case ADR-0058 opens — plus, in the last two
 * tests, what a record-relative predicate does on each side of that prop:
 * supplied (the dialog's values narrow the list) and absent (nothing narrows,
 * and no ambient context can stand in — see the note on `records` below, and
 * objectui#7206).
