 * objectui#9580 — the 「no data source」 gate speaks for a grid whose only row
 * source is a bare `data` ARRAY.
 *
 * ## What was wrong, and why it was a gate defect and not a carrier defect
 *
 * `gridNeedsDataSource` enumerates the escape hatches that let THIS placement
 * draw rows without an adapter, and one of them was `Array.isArray(schema.data)`
 * — an authored bare array. Two rulings had since retired that carrier on both
 * of its sides:
 *
 *   - objectui#8348 (「8348 以协议为准」, decision batch #83) at the shared
 *     record-source ladder, because this block's published `data` row is the
 *     `ViewData` OBJECT arm;
 *   - objectui#9571 (ruling objectui#8348 Q2-C, batch #136 item 3, maintainer
 *     「同意」) at the props channel, so `SchemaRenderer` no longer spreads an
 *     authored `data` as a React prop for a block on that arm.
 *
 * ⇒ the array no longer draws anything, while the predicate still answered
 * "this placement needs no adapter". A grid authored that way with no adapter
 * rendered the EMPTY SHELL objectui#5378 item 2 exists to replace, with the one
 * diagnostic addressed to exactly that situation staying silent. objectui#9571's
 * warn-once is `__DEV__`-only; this gate is the production-facing half.
 *
 * ⛔ Not in scope and ruled out twice: restoring the bare-array carrier. Rows
 * 1-2 assert what the gate SAYS, and every other row holds a leg that must not
 * move with it.
 *
 * ## How this file is meant to fail
 *
 * Rows 1-2 are the pin: they were RED on the predicate as it stood, because the
 * removed line made `requiresDataSource` false and the gate rendered the block
 * instead of the panel. Rows 3-7 are the controls that would catch a repair
 * that over-reached — the DECLARED inline spellings, the data-scope `bind`, the
 * HOST prop carrier objectui#9571 deliberately kept, and the `objectName` clause
 * that keeps a differently-broken grid pointed at its own defect.
