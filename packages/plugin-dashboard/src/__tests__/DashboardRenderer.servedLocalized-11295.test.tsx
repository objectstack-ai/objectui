/**
 * objectui#11295 — a SERVED dashboard is not translated a second time.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * A dashboard read from the server's `/meta` route is already resolved for the
 * request's locale: `translateDashboard` (`@objectstack/spec`) overlays the
 * packaged catalog onto `label`, `description` and each widget's `title`,
 * `description` and sub-caption (`options.description`), and since
 * objectstack#20680 / #20730 it keeps a published edit over that catalog (an
 * explicit override beats the packaged default). The renderer then ran the
 * client bundle over the served strings AGAIN, offering each served value as
 * the bundle's fallback — and a bundle entry always wins a fallback. So the
 * packaged catalog won a second time, client-side, and a published edit drew as
 * the shipped string. Measured in a browser on objectstack#20730: the console
 * drew `Total Users` (en) and `用户总数` (zh-CN) while its own `/meta/dashboard`
 * answer carried the edit.
 *
 * ## The signal
 *
 * `DashboardRenderer` cannot see where its document came from, so the host that
 * read it says so: `localized` is set by the console's dashboard page, which
 * draws a document from the `/meta` read (`DashboardView`). With it, the served
 * title, description and sub-caption are drawn as given. Without it — an inline
 * or preview document the server never translated — the bundle composition is
 * unchanged, and the last block below is the control for that.
 *
 * ## Directions, written before the run
 *
 *  - served + published edit, `en` and `zh-CN` → RED before the change (the
 *    bundle answered), GREEN after;
 *  - served + unedited (the server already put the translation in) → GREEN on
 *    both sides: drawing as given and re-translating agree when nothing was
 *    edited;
 *  - inline, the same edited document with no `localized` → GREEN on both
 *    sides: the bundle still wins there, which is the control.
