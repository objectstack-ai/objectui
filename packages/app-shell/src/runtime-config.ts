/**
 * Runtime configuration pushed by the server at boot.
 *
 * The SPA fetches `GET /api/v1/runtime/config` once before first paint
 * (`initRuntimeConfig()`) and exposes the response through a module-level
 * singleton (`config` + `getRuntimeConfig()`). Modules that need to know
 * about the upstream cloud URL or capability flags read from here —
 * NEVER from `window.location.hostname` or Vite-time env vars, since
 * those don't reflect the runtime the SPA is actually attached to (e.g.
 * a tenant ObjectOS runtime pointing at a separate cloud control plane).
 *
 * The runtime-config shape lives in app-shell because the Console SPA in
 * `apps/console` consumes app-shell code.
 *
 * Server-side producers of this payload — anchored by exported symbol +
 * package rather than by file path, because the previous path list went stale
 * (the framework implementation moved packages; the cloud repo deleted its
 * dead forked per-environment stack). Nothing imports across the repo
 * boundary, so this list is the only link between the two sides of the shape:
 *
 *   - `RuntimeConfigPlugin` from `@objectstack/cloud-connection` (framework)
 *     — the open implementation. Serves `GET /api/v1/runtime/config` and the
 *     legacy `GET /api/v1/studio/runtime-config` alias, and owns the
 *     `branding` / `features` shape mirrored below.
 *   - `RuntimeConfigPlugin` from `@objectstack/objectos-runtime` (cloud) —
 *     subclasses the open plugin to inject cloud plan policy, i.e. which plan
 *     unlocks `aiStudio` / `customDomain` / `sso`.
 *   - `createStudioRuntimeConfigPlugin` from `@objectstack/service-cloud`
 *     (cloud) — the multi-environment control-plane handshake.

 * names it, and neither `@objectstack/spec` nor `@objectstack/client`, which we
 * do pin, re-export it. So no version bump can deliver this key to us and no

 * so this function is a deliberate line-for-line mirror of
 * `readClientErrorReporting` exported from
 * `@objectstack/cloud-connection/telemetry-posture`, and
 * `runtime-config.test.ts` pins it in both directions.
 *
 * Every "cannot determine the answer" state — a non-object body, an absent
 * `telemetry` block, an absent `errorReporting` block, an empty DSN, a payload
 * from an older ObjectStack or a third-party host — carries no DSN and
 * therefore reads as OFF. That is stronger than the permission boolean this
 * replaced, which needed `=== true` plus a written argument about why a
 * negative `disabled` key would have been vacuous: absence of a SOURCE is not
 * a value that can be misread.
 *
 * The knobs are re-derived defensively — only a real `true` opts into PII, only
 * a finite `0`..`1` moves a sample rate — because `'true'`, `1` and `'yes'` are
 * payloads a consumer should not teach itself to accept.
 *
 * The DSN itself is accepted as any non-empty string, NOT re-run through the
 * producer's shape check: a server serving a working DSN that this quietly
 * discarded would rebuild the two-places-disagreeing failure objectstack#12681
 * deleted. `Sentry.init` is the authority on its own format. The one exception
 * is a DSN carrying a PASSWORD, refused here as well as at the producer —

 * distribution derives from its composition (cloud#2481): `true` exactly when
 * the endpoint is mounted, and no key at all on every other runtime. Both
 * console surfaces that read that one response, `StorageUsageBanner` and
 * `ReadRateBanner`, gate their request on this one boolean, so a runtime that
 * does not serve the endpoint is never asked.
 *
 * ⛔ Never infer this from the SHAPE OF A FAILURE. "Ask once and remember the
 * 404" spends the very request this flag exists to withhold, and reads a
 * control plane that is merely down as a runtime without the endpoint.
 *
 * Fails CLOSED (`=== true`), the opposite direction from
 * {@link isMarketplaceEnabled} and {@link isAiStudioEnabled}. Those withhold a
 * working capability on an unanswered question; this one decides whether to
 * make a request at all, and every unanswered question — a runtime predating
 * the key, a self-hosted runtime, a failed config fetch — is precisely the
 * population that would answer it with a 404. The cloud runtime that serves
 * the endpoint is also the one that serves the flag.
 *
 * `features?.` for the reason {@link isAiStudioEnabled} gives: a caller reached
 * through a partial snapshot sees `features` absent, and that must read as off,
 * not throw.

/**
 * The error-reporting sink this deployment's runtime served, or `null` for
 * "send nothing" (objectui#5522 / objectstack#12681).
 *
 * The whole telemetry configuration cloud#1508 asked for, from the one place a
 * platform user can reach. An air-gapped on-premises EE Console was measured
 * sending 14 Sentry envelopes per session to `sentry.io` carrying IP +
 * User-Agent PII, and could not be silenced because every knob in
 * `observability/sentry.ts` was a Vite build-time variable that Vite inlines as
 * a frozen literal. `@object-ui/console` publishes ONE pre-built SPA that the
 * hosted SaaS console and the on-prem/air-gapped EE images both embed, so the
 * artifact cannot tell those postures apart and editing env vars on the
 * deployed host does nothing. These values come from the server on every boot,
 * so they CAN — and ObjectStack's users, who never build this frontend, can
 * finally turn reporting ON as well as off.
 *
 * ⛔ Fails CLOSED, the opposite direction from {@link isMarketplaceEnabled} and
 * {@link isAiStudioEnabled} above — do not "make it consistent" with them.
 * Those withhold a working capability on an unanswered question, which is the
 * worse direction for a feature; here an unreported error is recoverable and
 * PII leaving an air-gapped deployment is not, so every unanswered question
 * must land on silence. Concretely: a runtime predating the key, a third-party
 * host, a 404 and a network failure all serve no DSN and read as OFF — which
 * is exactly the set of runtimes leaking today.
 *
 * The DSN's presence IS the grant, so this returns the configuration rather
 * than a boolean: there is no second question to ask, and a caller holding a
 * non-null result is holding everything it needs. See `observability/sentry.ts`
 * for the one place that consumes it.
