 *
 * objectui#5424 site 2 — role-addressed approvals reached the server as NO
 * identity at all.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `approverIdentities()` built the `approverId` query from `user.roles`. The
 * protocol-17 session face does not emit a `roles` key: framework ADR-0090 D3
 * renamed it to `positions` with no deprecation window, measured on a live
 * 17.1.0 server in objectui#5389 (`hasOwnProperty(user, 'roles')` answers
 * `false`; the payload carries `role`, `positions` and `isPlatformAdmin`). So
 * `u?.roles ?? []` was ALWAYS the empty array and the loop that appends
 * `role:<name>` never ran once.
 *
 * The consequence is silent and total for one whole class of approval: an
 * approval addressed to a POSITION rather than to a person (`pending_approvers`
 * holding `role:manager`) matched none of the identities sent, so it never
 * counted — gone from the bell badge, from the bell's Approvals tab, and from
 * Home's To-do card, with no error and no empty-state copy to notice. The
 * framework's own `customSession` docblock names this consumer by name.
 *
 * ## Why these pins are shaped this way
 *
 * The defect is an ALWAYS-EMPTY collection, so a pin that merely asserts "the
 * code reads `positions`" is worthless — it would be green against the broken
 * code too, which also read a key and also produced a request. Every case here
 * therefore asserts on the `role:`-prefixed identities that actually reach the
 * wire, i.e. what the server gets to match `pending_approvers` against. That is
 * the quantity that was empty.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted BEFORE running, measured in this PR)
 *
 * Restore the read to `u?.roles ?? []`, rebuild nothing (this suite resolves the
 * hook from source), and:
 *   - "sends a `role:` identity for every position" goes RED, and RED IN THE
 *     SHAPE THE CARD DESCRIBES: the role-identity list is `[]`, not a list with
 *     the wrong contents — received `[]`, expected `['role:manager',
 *     'role:platform_admin']`;
 *   - "still sends the person-addressed identities" stays GREEN — id and email
 *     never depended on the retired key, which is what makes the case above
 *     evidence about positions specifically rather than about the request
 *     existing at all;
 *   - the negative-control cases stay GREEN both ways — they carry neither key,
 *     so they cannot distinguish them; they are here to catch `role:undefined`,
 *     not to catch the rename.
 *
 * MEASURED: all three above held, the first one verbatim — `expected [] to
 * deeply equal [ 'role:manager', 'role:platform_admin' ]`. One case went red
 * that the prediction did NOT name: "does not resurrect the retired `roles` key
 * as a fallback". That is correct and welcome — restoring the old read is
 * exactly what makes the ghost key legible again, so the anti-alias pin is
 * load-bearing rather than decorative — but it was an unforeseen direction, and
 * is recorded here rather than quietly folded into the prediction.
 *
 * The fixture user is the exact payload objectui#5424 measured off the running
 * server, so a green here is a claim about a real session and not about a shape
 * invented to suit the fix.
 *
 * ## objectui#11455 — the spelling the server stores
 *
 * The identities above were `role:<p>`. The server stores a slot routed to a
 * position as `position:<p>`; `role:` is the framework ADR-0090 D3 deprecated
 * spelling, kept only for 15.x-era slots, and an approve that names it on a
 * `position:<p>` slot is refused. The builder now sends `position:<p>` and no
 * `role:` entry at all, so the pins read both halves off the wire: the
 * position-addressed subset is exactly the session's positions, and the
 * `role:`-prefixed subset is empty. The person-addressed case stays the
 * control: id and email are not positions and must not move.
 *
 * Reverse verification (predicted before running; the measured run is quoted
 * in the PR, not here): restore the `role:` prefix and the first case goes RED
 * — the position-addressed subset reads `[]` — while the person-addressed
 * control stays GREEN.
