 * objectui#7210, half 2 — maintainer ruling a′ (2026-09-02), on the map.
 *
 * The map's own defence — it auto-clusters above 100 markers — is exactly what
 * makes a silent cut invisible here: cluster bubbles redraw at whatever counts
 * they are given, so a map of the first N of a much larger set is a plausible
 * map with plausible bubbles, and its CAMERA is fitted to a bounding box that
 * is not the data's. The footnote is the only thing that says so.
 *
 * ⚠️ Environment: jsdom, with `react-map-gl/maplibre` stubbed the way the
 * sibling ObjectMap tests stub it (no WebGL in this lane). Nothing asserted
 * here depends on container size or on the real map's viewport — the note is a
 * sibling in the component's own tree, present or absent regardless of layout.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — MEASURED on two separate ablations (objectui#7507),
 * because this file grades two different things and one of them was missing:
 *
 *   1. Remove `...nonGridRowCeilingQuery()` from `ObjectMap`'s fetch ⇒ red
 *      at the **`$top` assertion**, and there only; 1 failed / 2 passed. NOT
 *      at the footnote, which is what this docblock used to predict. An
 *      adapter with no `$top` answers with the whole filtered set,
 *      `applyNonGridRowCeiling` slices it to the ceiling from the rows in
 *      hand, and both the marker count and the note stay correct. Losing the
 *      `$top` is a bandwidth regression, not a correctness one.
 *   2. Hand the view the RAW response instead of the capped rows
 *      (`setData(capped.rows)` → `setData(result.data ?? capped.rows)`) ⇒ red
 *      at the **marker-count assertion**, 2001 against 2000. Before #7507 that
 *      mutation left this file green at 4/4: `$top` was still sent and the
 *      footnote still rendered, while 2,001 markers were plotted. That is the
 *      hole the count case below closes, and it is the ruling's own pin text —
 *      "the DOM row count equals the ceiling".

    // replacing the capped hand-off with the raw response left this file green
    // at 4/4 with 2,001 markers on the map. This is the assertion that was
    // missing, and it is a case of its own for one reason:
    //
    // ⚠️ `enableClustering={false}` is what makes the count OBSERVABLE at all.
    // The map's default is to cluster above 100 markers, and a cluster bubble
    // is exactly a marker count folded into one DOM node — the defence the
    // file's own docblock names as what makes a silent cut invisible here.
    // Clustering is a pure function of the marker array, so turning it off
    // changes what is on screen and not what reached the view; with it on,
    // 2,000 and 2,001 markers render the same handful of bubbles.
