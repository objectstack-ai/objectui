/**
 * Renderers that read `schema.label` resolve the INLINE locale map (objectui#4580).
 *
 * `BaseSchema.label` and `.description` accept `string | I18nLabel` since
 * #4580's revised Q1 ruling (comment 5284973826) — `I18nLabel` being the spec's
 * INLINE locale MAP (`string | Record<string, string>` in `@objectstack/spec`
 * 17.0.0-rc.6). The DECLARED half of that is re-derived by
 * `inline-locale-declared-face-9092.test.ts` in `@object-ui/types`; the READ
 * half is re-derived by the cases below.
 *
 * ⚠️ The producer sentence this header carried is DEAD — quoted and dated,
 * not deleted. As written on 2026-08-13 (#4580, PR #4608) it read, truly of the
 * tree at that commit:
 *
 * > the shape a spec producer already writes: `bridgeListView` assigns
 * > `node.label = spec.label` at `list-view.ts:180`
 *
 * ⛔ FALSIFIED on 2026-08-29 by objectui#6366 (PR #6632), which removed the
 * whole spec-bridge — `SpecBridge`, `bridgeListView`, `bridgeFormView` — from
 * `@object-ui/react` as a declared BREAKING CHANGE. ⛔ Nothing re-derives that
 * sentence, so it is quoted rather than left reading as live (AGENTS.md #9): a
 * test header is the worst place for a confident sentence about a producer that
 * is gone, and reading it as live already cost objectui#9092 a
 * premise-falsification round.
 *
 * Resolution happens at READ time, here, against the display locale — NOT at
 * the spec bridge. PR #4603 measured the bridge unable to do it: it is a plain
 * class method that cannot call a hook, `BridgeContext` declares no locale, and
 * `updateContext()` has zero callers, so a bridge-resolved label would freeze
 * one audience's language into the node tree (the spec's own resolver doc
 * records that defect class as objectstack#6761).
 *
 * ## The site class, and why these three are ONE case
 *
 * The widening turned every blind `schema.label`-as-string read into a named
 * TS2322 — that compiler inventory IS the audit, and it named exactly four
 * sites repo-wide, all of them the SAME class: the label reaching a React child
 * position. Three are in this package; the fourth is
 * `plugin-dashboard/src/DashboardGridLayout.tsx` and is pinned in that package.
 *
 * ## Red-first — measured BEFORE the fix, verbatim
 *
 * Each of the three renderers below was invoked with
 * `label: { en: 'Owner', 'zh-CN': '负责人' }` against the unfixed source. All
 * three THREW, with byte-identical messages:
 *
 * ```
 * Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {en, zh-CN}).
 * If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.
 * ```
 *
 * Not `[object Object]` — a throw. A text node is one of the positions React
 * refuses outright rather than stringifying, so the pre-fix harm is the whole
 * subtree failing to render, not a cosmetic mis-render.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`dropdown-menu`'s harm is invisible unless the menu is OPEN.** Radix
 * mounts `DropdownMenuContent` lazily, so the first probe of that renderer
 * returned an EMPTY container and no throw — a case that would have shipped
 * looking green while proving nothing. `defaultOpen: true` is what makes the
 * label reachable, and it is load-bearing in the case below for that reason.
 *
 * ## Why these invoke the registered renderer DIRECTLY
 *
 * Same reason PR #4603's toggle case does: `SchemaRenderer` injects its own
 * props around a renderer, and a test driven through it can be green in both
 * directions. `ComponentRegistry.get(name)` returns the component the registry
 * actually renders (`React.createElement`, `SchemaRenderer.tsx:621`) — which is
 * also why calling `useDisplayLocale()` inside these renderers is legal.
