 * `body` dialect PRODUCER scan (objectui#9871).
 *
 * ## The question this answers, and the one it refuses
 *
 * ⛔ NOT "how many producers are left". That question is what this file exists
 * to end. objectui#7181 named six producers, objectui#9847 found a seventh the
 * table never listed, and objectui#9871's retriage found two more — while
 * `pnpm census:body-dialect` read CLEAN (`app-metadata` 1 → 0) across all of
 * it. The two latest sites share something sharper than "they were missed":
 * ⭐ NO instrument in the tree could have found them.
 *
 * ⇒ the question is **WHAT MAKES THE TABLE COMPLETE**, and the answer has to be
 * a CRITERION a future site can be held against — ⛔ not a list a future site
 * has to be remembered onto.
 *
 * ## ⭐ THE CRITERION — what counts as a producer of the `body` child-list dialect
 *
 * A site is a PRODUCER iff C1 and C2 both hold. C3 is not a qualifier; it is
 * the axis the answer is FILED under, and it is recorded rather than assumed.
 *
 *   C1 — EMISSION. The site causes the literal key `body` to appear in metadata
 *        that a party OUTSIDE this tree then owns. Three channels are measured
 *        (`EMISSION_CHANNELS`): `default-props` (a registration's declared
 *        default, materialised into the author's page when the component is
 *        dropped), `scaffold` (written into files a tool creates), and
 *        `snippet` (inserted into the author's already-open document).
 *
 *   C2 — RESOLUTION. Some reader in this tree resolves a `body` off that
 *        carrier INTO A CHILD LIST. This is what separates the dialect from
 *        every unrelated `body`: an HTTP payload, `bodyExtra`, the `body`
 *        typography variant. ⭐ The reader set is DERIVED from source on every
 *        run (`deriveReaders`) — ⛔ never enumerated here, because an
 *        enumeration is the defect this file replaces.
 *
 *   C3 — CARRIER. Which object the key is spelled ON, because that decides
 *        WHICH PUBLISHED CONTRACT the site is judged against:
 *          `node`   — the object is a `BaseSchema` node. `body` is a DECLARED
 *                     twin of `children` there (`packages/types/src/base.ts`).
 *                     This is objectui#6771's ruled family.
 *          `item`   — the object is a member of a registration's declared item
 *                     array (`TabItem`, `ListItem`). ⚠️ Its canonical child-list
 *                     key is `content`, and `body` is declared on NEITHER
 *                     published face. ⛔ UNRULED — see "The open question".
 *          `string` — the spelling is carried by a string the tool writes into
 *                     the author's document. The carrier is whatever node the
 *                     author accepts it onto, which this instrument does not
 *                     see. Reported as such, ⛔ never guessed.
 *
 * ## ⛔ What the criterion deliberately EXCLUDES, so a zero is readable
 *
 * `NOT_A_PRODUCER` below is the machine-readable form and every run emits it.
 * The four exclusions, and why each is not appetite:
 *
 *   - a DECLARATION (`inputs: [{ name: 'body' }]`, a published type member)
 *     TEACHES the spelling and writes nothing. It is a real surface and a real
 *     problem — it is simply a different one, and folding it in would make the
 *     producer count unreadable.
 *   - a READER (`renderChildren(schema.body)`) consumes; it does not emit. The
 *     readers are C2's instrument, so scoring them as producers would make this
 *     scan report its own denominator.
 *   - a `body` that no reader resolves as a child list fails C2 outright.
 *   - authored CORPUS, teaching snippets and fixtures are the dialect's
 *     VICTIMS, not its producers. They are bucketed and reported apart.
 *
 * ## ⭐ The two blindnesses this closes, and they are STRUCTURAL not incidental
 *
 * `scripts/body-dialect-census.mjs` scores a child list only on an object that
 * ALSO carries a string-literal `type`, and never reads inside a string or
 * template literal. Both limits are DECLARED there — ⛔ this is not a bug
 * report against the census. They are the two directions a classifier keyed on
 * "object with a `type`" is PERMANENTLY blind in, and each has a live site:
 *
 *   B1 — no sibling `type` is required here. A frame is scored on the `body`
 *        key ITSELF, so a non-node item (`{ label, value, body: [...] }`) is
 *        visible. `walkFrames` records `type` as a CARRIER fact, ⛔ never as an
 *        admission test — and it accepts a `type` of ANY value, where the
 *        census requires a string literal.
 *   B2 — literals are READ, not skipped. `scanSource` (the shared masker,
 *        `scripts/js-comment-mask.mjs`) is projected TWICE over one scan:
 *        comments-and-literals blanked for the structural walk, comments-only
 *        blanked for the key sweep. The `literal` flag is then what TELLS THE
 *        TWO APART — a key token at a literal-flagged offset is a spelling
 *        inside a string, which is exactly B2's population.
 *
 * ⚠️ Both projections come from ONE `scanSource` pass, ⛔ never a private
 * comment stripper: a regex has no idea what a string literal is, and this file
 * would be the last place that could afford to get literals wrong.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The open question this scan REPORTS and ⛔ does not answer
 *
 * Is an `item`-carried `body` inside objectui#6771's ruled family?
 *
 * ⛔ UNRULED, and this instrument does not rule it. It files `item` hits in
 * their own table and REFUSES to fold them into the ruled total, because every
 * measured fact points at a DIFFERENT contract rather than the same one:
 * #6771's remedy is "`children` is the one spelling" and its step 3 retires
 * `body` from `BaseSchema` — while the item face declares `content` (required
 * on `TabItem`, optional on `ListItem`), declares no `body` on either the TS or
 * the Zod face, and objectui#9256 filed the item channel separately and pinned
 * it LIVE on purpose. Deciding it here would EXTEND a ruled family rather than
 * apply one. The measurements are on objectui#9871.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/body-dialect-producer-scan.mjs
 *   node scripts/body-dialect-producer-scan.mjs --root . --json
