/**
 * objectui#8980 — a READ POINT per protocol member a named list view declares.
 *
 * ## The card, and the ruling
 *
 * The protocol declares 17 live members on the value type of
 * `ViewSchema.listViews` / `ObjectSchema.listViews` (`ObjectListViewSchema`,
 * `@objectstack/spec/ui`) that `NamedListView` declared NONE of — objectui
 * NARROWER than the protocol, the direction the maintainer's standing principle
 * forbids. Director-seat class-one adjudication of 2026-09-13 ruled: declare all
 * 17 with their types taken from the protocol, and give each a read point IN THE
 * SAME DELIVERY. This file is that second half.
 *
 * ⛔ The declaration half is NOT re-pinned here; it lives with the census in
 * `packages/types/src/__tests__/object-view-unmirrored-keys-7779.test.ts`, which
 * partitions the interface into read and unread members (the counts are that
 * file's reading, re-derived on every run — not restated here) and fails in
 * EITHER direction when a member moves between them.
 *
 * ## objectui#10758 — the rest of the protocol members, on route 3
 *
 * Bucket ① of the objectui#7924 ruling: the protocol members a named view
 * declares that no route read off the named view. The delegation (route 3) now
 * reads each of them off the named view first. Their block is the last route-3
 * describe below: one named view per member FAMILY, with the members this file
 * already pinned riding the same fixture as the firing control.
 *
 * ## The three routes out of `ObjectView`, and which member uses which
 *
 * The component has three exits, and the card's members do not all leave by the
 * same one. Pinning only one of them would have left two thirds of the ruling
 * unmeasured.
 *
 *  1. `generateViewSchema` — the AUTHORED path for a non-grid view: no host
 *     supplied `renderListView`, so this is what the REGISTERED `object-view`
 *     renderer runs. Carries the 8 view-kind blocks to `ObjectKanban`,
 *     `ObjectCalendar`, `ObjectGallery`, `ObjectTimeline`, `ObjectGantt`,
 *     `ObjectMap`, `ObjectChart`, `ObjectTree`.
 *  2. `gridSchema` → `ObjectGrid` — the AUTHORED path for `type: 'grid'`, and
 *     the read point for `grouping` / `rowColor`, both of which `ObjectGrid`
 *     already reads (`collectGroupingFieldRefs(schema.grouping)`,
 *     `useRowColor(schema.rowColor)`).
 *  3. the `renderListView` delegation — the HOST path (objectui#5097), whose
 *     sink is `ListView`, the renderer that reads `fieldOrder`, `grouping`,
 *     `rowColor`, `userActions`, `appearance` and `data`.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ THREE MEMBERS ARE REPORTED, NOT WIRED — the ruling's own item 2
 *
 * "A member for which the renderer has no behaviour to attach is REPORTED on
 * this card with the measurement, ⛔ not silently declared inert and ⛔ not
 * dropped from the type."
 *
 *  - `tabs` and `pageName` — no reader on this surface at all. The last describe
 *    block below pins BOTH the absence and the control that makes it a reading.
 *  - `chart` / `tree` — READ (case 8 below proves it), but objectui#5321 ruled
 *    both view KINDS host-composition-only, so a named view reaches them only by
 *    declaring no `type` of its own while a host `views` entry selects one. That
 *    narrow route is pinned rather than described.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification — direction predicted BEFORE the run
 *
 * Each FIX case was predicted to go RED on the base tree (`bbc9dc34e3`), where
 * the canonical top-level blocks were undeclarable and none of the six relay /
 * grid rungs existed; each CONTROL case rides a rung this card did not touch and
 * was predicted GREEN. The asymmetry is the point: a control that moves with the
 * fix is a control that was carrying the fix. Measured outcome on the PR.
