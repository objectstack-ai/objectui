/**
 * Home item-type label parity (objectui#6165).
 *
 * Three Home surfaces render a label for the same item kind — the rail
 * (`HomeRail.HomeContinue`), the Recently-Accessed cards (`RecentApps`) and
 * the Starred cards (`StarredApps`) — through one key namespace,
 * `home.recentApps.itemType.*`. They disagreed on the FALLBACK: the cards
 * rendered `capitalizeFirst(type)` while the rail rendered the bare `type`,
 * so an unkeyed kind read `Report` on the cards and `report` in the rail, on
 * the same screen.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THE FIXTURE USES A SYNTHETIC KIND. Every member of the union today
 * (`object|dashboard|page|report|record|metadata`, plus `nav` on the favorite
 * side) HAS a key, so a test built on a real member takes the keyed path and
 * never reaches the fallback — it passes both before and after the fix and
 * proves nothing. The pin therefore uses a kind with NO key. That is the
 * whole point of the card: the defect is dormant for today's members and
 * wakes up for the next one added.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IS ASSERTED. The defect is DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN CONSUMERS, so the
 * assertion is agreement — all three surfaces resolving one kind to one
 * string — not any single component's output in isolation.
