 * objectui#10036 — the record fetch may not re-fire because React threw a
 * memo cache away.
 *
 * Two banned identities sat on the same seam (AGENTS.md §5 commandment #10,
 * ruled on objectui#8640 over eight prior instances):
 *
 *   1. `reload`'s dependency list named `effectiveDataSource`, a `useMemo`
 *      result. `resolveDataSource` returns the context adapter UNCHANGED for
 *      `provider: 'object'`, but CONSTRUCTS a new `ApiDataSource` /
 *      `ValueDataSource` for `provider: 'api'` and `'value'` — so on those two
 *      providers a discarded memo hands back a fresh adapter for a byte-
 *      identical config, and `reload` is rebuilt for no authored reason.
 *   2. The mount effect named `reload`, a `useCallback` result — and a
 *      discarded `useCallback` yields a fresh function whatever its own
 *      dependency list says, INCLUDING an empty one. So fixing (1) alone
 *      cannot be observed and does not close the defect: both sides of the
 *      seam, or neither holds.
 *
 * The file already recorded half of this in the first person: `dataItems` was
 * removed from `reload`'s dependency list precisely because a discard «was
 * enough to give `reload` a fresh identity and re-fire the mount effect below
 * (objectui#6592)». One banned identity came off that line; another stayed.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS PIN FORCES A DISCARD, AND WHAT IT WOULD BE WITHOUT ONE.
 * Commandment #10 states the blind spot itself: React does not discard
 * spontaneously in this tree (measured on the pinned React 19.2.8 while
 * objectui#6724 landed, and this repo still has no `Activity`/Offscreen
 * subtree), so an ordinary render-count or request-count pin here is GREEN on
 * the defect AND on the fix and therefore asserts nothing. The discriminating
 * input is a FORCED discard. The proxy below is the one
 * `packages/permissions/src/__tests__/providerCtxIdentity.discarded.test.tsx`
 * uses (objectui#6813 / #6862), for the same reasons it records: it patches
 * `useMemo` AND `useCallback` at the MODULE level, because the component
 * reaches them through its own `import { … } from 'react'` bindings and
 * `vi.spyOn`/assignment/`defineProperty` on the frozen `[object Module]`
 * namespace all fail to patch those — silently leaving any pin built on them
 * unfalsifiable. It arms EVERY memo and callback in the tree rather than ones
 * matched by a marker dependency: a marker on `effectiveDataSource` alone
 * would leave `reload`'s own `useCallback` un-discarded, which is exactly the
 * half of the seam (2) names.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE OBSERVABLE IS A REQUEST COUNT, NOT AN IDENTITY COMPARE. An identity
 * comparison can hold while the effect re-runs for some other reason. Requests
 * are served by a double passed as `SchemaRendererProvider`'s `apiFetch`, so
 * nothing here reaches happy-dom's `http://localhost:3000` and is attributed
 * to this file by the network-escape guard (objectui#8537).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE PROVIDER IS `'api'` ON PURPOSE. `ObjectGantt.discardedConfigMemo.test.tsx`
 * records why an `object`-provider pin cannot see this: `resolveDataSource`
 * answers that provider with the `fallback` context DataSource UNCHANGED, so
 * `effectiveDataSource`'s VALUE is referentially stable there even when its
 * memo reruns. That file names the gap it leaves as a "Known boundary" for the
 * `api` / `value` providers. This is that boundary, measured.
