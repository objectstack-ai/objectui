 * Helper to get data configuration from schema.

 * The ruled three-rung ladder itself (`data`, then `staticData`, then

 * implementation of a contract published on both faces (objectui#6939), which
 * this file used to hand-copy (objectui#7632).
 *
 * What used to stay here was the head above it: the array shorthand, which
 * lifted `data: [...]` to `{ provider: 'value', items }`.
 * ⛔ IT IS GONE (objectui#8348, decision batch #83, maintainer verbatim
 * 「8348 以协议为准」 — the contract decides). Its old justification was that the
 * shorthand is "a deliberate, commented convention across this block family",
 * i.e. that the other blocks accept it too. The ruling replaces that argument
 * with the row: a renderer honours the `data` spelling its block's PUBLISHED row
 * declares and no other.
 *
 * MEASURED: `@objectstack/spec` 17.4.0 has NO `ComponentPropsMap['object-map']`
 * row, so the published row that governs this block is this repo's own
 * `ObjectMapSchema.data` (`@object-ui/types`), `ViewDataSchema.optional()` —
 * @objectstack/spec's `z.discriminatedUnion('provider', [...])` over OBJECT
 * variants, whose `value` member additionally declares
 * `aliases: { data: 'items', rows: 'items', records: 'items' }`. A bare array
 * is off that row twice over, and this block's registration declares no `data`
 * input that could say otherwise.
 *
 * ⛔ WHAT THIS REACHES, measured per CARRIER — do NOT read it as "the array is
 * gone". `SchemaRenderer` spreads every non-metadata node key as a React prop
 * and `index.tsx` forwards `{...props}`, so an authored `data` array also
 * arrives on the props channel, which outranks the schema (objectui#5003
 * order). At the ladder the array is no longer a record source; through
 * `SchemaRenderer` an authored `data: [ …rows… ]` still draws, from that prop.
 * Both halves are pinned in `ObjectMap.schemaDataShorthand.test.tsx`.
 * Collapsing the two carriers would take the host path with it and is outside
 * objectui#8348's scope — reported on the card, not changed in passing.
 *
 * The declared spellings for inline rows are
 * `data: { provider: 'value', items: [...] }` and `staticData: [...]`, both
 * unchanged.

   * Memoized on the ONE value `getDataConfig` reads, and nothing else
   * (objectui#6018) — the same shape `mapConfig` below landed for
   * objectui#5976, now that the two lines agree.
   *
   * `dataConfig` is a dependency of the fetch effect, and that effect calls
   * `setData`, so a fresh identity here is a refetch loop rather than mere
   * waste. That hazard is real and is what the previous form's "prevent
   * infinite loops" comment recorded. What has changed is the PRICE of the
   * guard, not the guard: identity was bought by calling `getDataConfig` bare
   * in the render body and re-serializing the result with `JSON.stringify` on
   * EVERY render, only to hand back the object the memo already held.
   *
   * `[schema]` is the whole dependency, not a shorthand for one: `getDataConfig`
   * is a pure function of `schema` and reads exactly three keys off it
   * (`data`, `staticData`, `objectName`), nothing ambient. So no deep-compare
   * key is needed to make the identity hold — the identity that reaches this
   * component is already stable across the renders that matter. Every
   * re-render `ObjectMap` causes ITSELF (data landing, the object definition
   * landing, search typing, zoom, selection, geolocation) leaves the prop
   * untouched by construction, which is precisely the loop path; and the three
   * callers upstream each hand over a memoized node: `SchemaRenderer`'s
   * `evaluatedSchema`, the gate's `mapped` in `useElementDataSourceSchema`,
   * and `ListView`'s `viewComponentSchema`.
   *
   * Dropping the serialize is also a correctness move, not only a cost one.
   * `JSON.stringify` is not a total function — it THROWS on a value it cannot
   * serialize — and the passthrough branch of `getDataConfig` returns the
   * author's own `schema.data` object verbatim, inline `value` rows included.
   * So a record graph carrying a back-reference (an `$expand`-ed lookup handed
   * to the block as inline data) or a `BigInt` id took the whole map subtree
   * down from the render body. Comparing identities never serializes, so the
   * config no longer has to be serializable at all.
   * `ObjectMap.dataConfigMemo.test.tsx` pins both halves.

   * marker transform below names it in its dependency array, so that `useMemo`
   * recomputed on every single render while declaring that it does not. The
   * invalidation cascaded from there: `filteredMarkers` → `clusteredData` /
   * `markerBounds` → `initialViewState` all key on the array it produces.
   *
   * `[schema]` is the whole dependency, not a shorthand for one: `getMapConfig`

   * `dataConfig` line above used to carry, and as of objectui#6018 that line
   * no longer carries it either — both are keyed on `[schema]` now. The
