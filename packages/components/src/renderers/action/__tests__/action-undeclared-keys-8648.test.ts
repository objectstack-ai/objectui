 * objectui#8648 — the four keys the two action renderers read off
 * `UIActionSchema` without a declaration: `disabled`, `recordIdField`,
 * `resultDialog`, `undoable` (the objectui#8327 family's `components` card).
 *
 * This file is the instrument for every claim the ruling rests on, so each is
 * re-derived on every run instead of being written down once (AGENTS.md #9).
 *
 * ## The rule that chose the exit, and why it chose the same one four times
 *
 * `@object-ui/types` is a MIRROR of `@objectstack/spec`, not an authority, so
 * declaring a key the platform does not declare would make this repo accept
 * what the platform refuses. The question per key is therefore: does the
 * contract declare it, and on WHICH schema? Both halves matter — a token that
 * exists somewhere under the UI contract is not a declaration on the schema a
 * given read's node maps to.
 *
 * All four came back DECLARED on `@objectstack/spec`'s `ActionSchema`, which is
 * the schema `UIActionSchema` mirrors and the one both renderers annotate their
 * `schema` prop with. ⇒ ALIGN THE MIRROR, four times, each on its own reading.
 * The four verdicts agreeing is a RESULT here, not a shortcut: the census below
 * asks the question once per key, and its inline sibling — where two of the
 * four are absent — is what proves the question can come back "no".
 *
 * ## What each leg can and cannot prove
 *
 *   - The `Equal` legs are compiled by `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` and by
 *     nothing else — vitest strips types. They are the ONLY half that can
 *     observe the declaration itself, because what was wrong before this card
 *     was a TypeScript-only absence: the reads compiled through an `as any`
 *     cast and behaved identically at runtime.
 *   - The census legs read the INSTALLED `@objectstack/spec` artifact, over the
 *     contract's own action schemas. They are the PREMISE of the alignment,
 *     never its evidence: they were green before this card and are green after.
 *     They earn their place by going RED the day the platform retires one of
 *     the four — which is the signal that this mirror owes an update.
 *   - The source-text legs read the two renderers through the shared comment
 *     mask, so a re-introduced `as any` is caught by a run that never
 *     type-checks. ⭐ That negative is load-bearing and is the lesson
 *     objectui#8649 paid for: a cast at the read site defeats a declaration
 *     that a MEMBERSHIP instrument (`getPropertyOfType` on the binding, which
 *     unwraps the cast) still reports as present. Declaring without un-casting
 *     is an inert declaration that pins green.
 *   - Every negative leg carries a control that varies ONLY the claim.
 *   - The last block is a LEDGER, not a pin on a good state. Un-casting the
 *     `resultDialog` READ made the compiler name a second, separate defect the
 *     `as any` had been hiding: `@object-ui/core`'s `ResultDialogSpec` is a
 *     hand copy of the contract's block whose `title` / `description` /
 *     `acknowledge` are `string` where the contract says `I18nLabel`. That fix
 *     is in another package and needs an i18n-resolution decision, so it is
 *     filed as objectui#9542 and the WRITE carries a narrowing assertion here
 *     meanwhile. The ledger leg asserts that workaround is still exactly what
 *     it says it is — so it cannot quietly become `as any` again, and it goes
 *     red (as an unused entry) when objectui#9542 lands and the assertions go.
