/**
 * The `console.objectView.*` config-panel vocabulary is retired, and must stay
 * that way (objectui#4730, ruled 2026-08-19).
 *
 * ## What was removed and why
 *
 * The namespace held 209 keys in each of the ten packs. 116 of them labelled a
 * view-configuration settings panel that does not exist: appearance and density
 * toggles, accessibility attributes, conditional-formatting rules, row-action
 * and inline-edit switches, quick-filter builders, an advanced-settings tier.
 * They had no reader anywhere in the repo — no `t()` call site, no dynamic
 * template form reaching them, and no textual occurrence of the dotted key
 * outside the packs that define it.
 *
 * The plausible consumer confirms the story rather than contradicting it:
 * `packages/app-shell/src/views/ViewConfigPanel.tsx` was migrated off the legacy
 * `buildViewConfigSchema` engine onto `ViewVariantInspector`, a spec-driven
 * inspector whose field labels come from `@objectstack/spec` metadata (through
 * `useMetadataLocale`) rather than from this namespace. The panel these 116 keys
 * were written for was replaced; the keys were not cleaned up with it.
 *
 * ## The part that looks like a mistake and is not
 *
 * Four retired keys name `ListViewSchema` properties that are very much still
 * active — `rowActions`, `inlineEdit`, `hiddenFields`, `filterableFields`. They
 * are retired anyway, by explicit maintainer ruling: **a live schema property is
 * not a consumer of a locale string; only a labelled UI control is.** Nothing
 * renders a label for these properties, so nothing reads their label. If a
 * settings panel is ever specified, its keys are re-authored alongside it.
 *
 * ## Why this pin is NEGATIVE, and why it is needed at all
 *
 * Every i18n gate in this repo runs **call site → key**, never key → call site
 * (the same argument `report-editor-retired-4145.test.ts` sets out next door):
 * `check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` never visits a key with no call site,
 * `all-locales-key-parity` is fully satisfied by 116 dead keys present in all
 * ten packs, and `check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` only fires when an `en` value
 * CHANGES. `check-i18n-dead-keys.mjs` is the sweep that FOUND these, and it is
 * report-only by design — it enforces nothing and is wired into no workflow. So
 * the packs can re-accumulate this namespace with every gate green, which is
 * exactly how it grew. The guard has to be written down by name.
 *
 * Reverse-verified: restoring one retired key to one pack turns this pin red
 * (naming the pack and the key) and `all-locales-key-parity` red alongside it;
 * deleting one LIVE key instead turns this file's live-subset assertion red
 * while the retired-key assertions stay green, which is what makes this a
 * classifier rather than a rubber stamp.

/**
 * The repo root, derived from THIS FILE's own location — never from

 *
 * It was `process.cwd()` until then, on the reasoning that
 * `scripts/vitest-invocation-guard.mjs` refuses any invocation whose vitest root
 * is not the repo root. That guard is real, but it is a DIFFERENT invariant:
 * `--root` moves VITEST's root and moves nothing about `process.cwd()`. This
 * package's own `test` script — `vitest run --root ../.. packages/i18n/`, which
 * is what `pnpm --filter … test` and `turbo run test` both run — leaves cwd at
 * `packages/i18n/`, so every read below resolved against the package directory
 * and the assertions guarding them failed.

 * Spelled in string operations, copying the landed precedent of objectui#7791
 * (PR #7796): `new URL(rel, import.meta.url)` is REWRITTEN by Vite into a
 * `http://localhost:3000/@fs/…` dev-server URL, so only bare `import.meta.url`
 * is read here and taken apart by hand. Measured on this card under both cwds

 * The 116 retired keys, listed BY NAME in the packs' own order rather than
 * counted. A count passes when one key returns and another leaves; the names do
 * not. 209 keys existed in the namespace; 116 were retired; 93 survived — 94
 * since objectui#5232 added `viewConfigPermissionDenied`, the refusal shown when
 * a session without `manage_metadata` tries to change ORG-WIDE view config
 * (objectstack#7494's ruling). An ADDITION to a live namespace is not a
 * regression of the retirement this file pins: none of the retired keys
 * came back, which is what the `it` below actually asserts.
 *
 * ## The objectui#8754 addition — 116 retired become 118
 *
 * `groupBy` and `toolbar` joined the retired list in objectui#8754's deletion
 * round, and they are here rather than in that card's own pin because THIS file
 * owns the namespace's arithmetic: a `console.objectView.*` key retired anywhere
 * else would move the surviving count out from under the assertions below.
 *
 * Both were dead all along and were held out of objectui#4730's sweep by a
 * measurement defect, not by a reader. `check-i18n-dead-keys`' text net matched
 * on a plain substring, so each was demoted by a LONGER live sibling that merely
 * contains it — `groupBy` by `groupByField` / `groupByFieldHelp`
 * (`CreateViewDialog.tsx`), `toolbar` by `toolbarEnabledCount`. PR objectui#8753
 * put a key-boundary requirement on both sides of the probe, which is what moved
 * them into CONFIRMED. Note that `toolbarHint` was ALREADY retired here while
 * `toolbar` was not — a split with no reason behind it, which is the shape a
 * substring false-positive leaves.
 *
 * ⚠️ The total below stays 210 and that is deliberate: 210 is the count of keys
 * that ever EXISTED in this namespace, split into a retired half that only
 * grows and a surviving half that shrinks to match. A retirement moves the
 * split; only a genuinely new key moves the total.
