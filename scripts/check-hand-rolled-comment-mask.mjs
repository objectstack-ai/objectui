 * check-hand-rolled-comment-mask -- a NEW private comment stripper is visible.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-hand-rolled-comment-mask.mjs              # the sweep
 *   node scripts/check-hand-rolled-comment-mask.mjs --list       # every carrier, with its regex
 *   node scripts/check-hand-rolled-comment-mask.mjs --self-test  # the detector's own cases
 *
 * Exit: 0 = no carrier outside `DEBT`, and every `DEBT` entry still carries one
 *       1 = BREACH -- a private comment projection at a path `DEBT` does not name
 *       2 = a STALE `DEBT` entry: the site it excuses is gone, so the line must go
 *       3 = REFUSAL -- the corpus came back below `CORPUS_FLOOR`, so nothing was read
 *       4 = usage
 *
 * ## Why this file exists, and why the sweeps did not close it
 *
 * `scripts/js-comment-mask.mjs` is the one answer to "is this span a comment, or
 * code?", graded against a parser by `check-comment-mask-corpus.mjs`. Reaching
 * that answer privately -- a regex pair that deletes what LOOKS like a comment --
 * is the defect those two exist to end, because a regex has no idea what a string
 * literal is: a block-comment opener inside a string opens a PHANTOM comment that
 * runs to the next real terminator, and the reader then reports clean over code it
 * never looked at.
 *
 * This repository has swept that population THREE times -- objectui#9183 moved 29
 * carriers, objectui#9613 moved one more, objectui#7882 repaired the masker
 * itself -- and after every sweep the tree held no instrument that could see a new
 * carrier appear. It did appear:
 * `packages/plugin-form/src/LineItemsPanel.parentIdNoCast-9333.test.ts` was first
 * committed about 39 hours after objectui#9183 closed, into a tree that sweep had
 * just cleaned, and nothing reported it. objectui#9751 is the finding; this file
 * is the half of it that outlives a sweep.
 *
 * ⛔ A sweep is not an instrument. It is a reading of one day, and the day after
 * it merges the population is free to grow again with nothing to say so.
 *
 * ## The shape this refuses, in two halves
 *
 * A carrier is a regex literal that BOTH
 *
 *   1. SPANS A COMMENT -- an escaped block opener, a wildcard repetition, then an
 *      escaped block closer; or an escaped line opener followed by a
 *      to-end-of-line consumer. This is the shape that answers "where are the
 *      comments in this source?".
 *
 *   2. sits in a REMOVAL POSITION -- it is the first argument of `.replace(`, or
 *      it is immediately preceded by `!` (the rejection half of a line filter).
 *      This is what makes the match a PROJECTION of the source rather than a
 *      lookup inside it.
 *
 * Both halves are load-bearing, and dropping either one was measured rather than
 * reasoned about. Without (1), `pnpm lint`-shaped noise: a regex trimming a
 * docblock's delimiters off text already known to be a comment is a different job,
 * and the shared masker is the wrong answer for it. Without (2), an extractor
 * scores as a carrier: `ownHeaderComment` in two of this directory's own tests
 * uses exactly the shape in (1) with `.exec` to FIND this file's leading docblock,
 * which is a lookup, not a projection.
 *
 * ## What this gate cannot see, named rather than hidden
 *
 * A projection assembled some other way is out of reach: a hand-written scanner
 * loop, a `.split()` on a comment regex, or a rejection routed through a named
 * `const` rather than an inline literal. The shape above is the one every carrier
 * the three sweeps moved was written in, and the one both shapes on objectui#9751
 * were written in -- it is where the population actually is, not where it could
 * theoretically be. Widening it is a measurement somebody has to take first; ⛔ do
 * not widen it on the strength of this paragraph alone.
 *
 * The sweep also reads only the JS family (`SOURCE_EXTENSIONS`). A projection
 * written in a fenced example inside a `.md` is invisible here.
 *
 * ## Why a DEBT list and not an assertion at zero, and why it cannot grow
 *
 * ⛔ Not an allowlist. `DEBT` is the shrink-only shape this repository already
 * uses in `check-lint-coverage.mjs` and `check-type-check-coverage.mjs`, and it is
 * enforced in BOTH directions:
 *
 *   a carrier at a path `DEBT` does not name           -> exit 1
 *   a `DEBT` entry whose site no longer carries one    -> exit 2, delete the line
 *
 * The second direction is the whole difference between a ratchet and a baseline.
 * An allowlist that grows is paid for by adding a line; this one is paid for by
 * a line that must be DELETED the moment the site is fixed, and a fixed site that
 * keeps its line turns the tree red. ⛔ The remedy for a breach is to convert the
 * site onto `js-comment-mask.mjs`, never to add an entry here.
 *
 * Zero was not available on the day this landed, and that is a measurement rather
 * than a preference. Run over `2414e3751` -- the base this branched from, before
 * the four conversions -- this sweep reported 14 carriers in 9 files and exited 1,
 * naming exactly the four objectui#9751 was scoped to convert and no others. The
 * five below are the remainder it turned up, and none of them was on that card or
 * any other. Asserting zero would have turned a green tree red on day one over
 * sites nobody had yet looked at -- the posture `check-comment-mask-corpus.mjs`
 * declined for the same reason.
 *
 * ⚠️ Those figures are a SNAPSHOT under a named commit, which is why the commit is
 * named. ⛔ Do not refresh them in place under the old sha; re-take the reading and
 * name the new one. `--list` prints today's, and the entries below are a worklist
 * rather than a settlement.
 *
 * Each entry says what the site is and what paying it off would take, because a
 * bare path is a line the next reader cannot act on. One of them is NOT payable by
 * conversion and says so: a CSS subject is not a JavaScript subject, and pointing a
 * JavaScript masker at it would substitute a fresh guess for a graded answer --
 * the same refusal `skill-guide-data-table-binding.test.tsx` already carries for
 * jsonc.
 *
 * ## Where this runs
 *
 * `scripts/__tests__/check-hand-rolled-comment-mask.test.ts` runs the sweep and
 * the self-test, inside the `unit` project the root `vitest.config.mts` points at
 * `scripts/**` -- so this gate rides the `Test (shard N/4)` job that already
 * exists. ⛔ It adds no CI context and touches no workflow file.
