/**
 * objectui#7265 — `filter-tokens.ts` carried module-local copies of two
 * `@objectstack/spec/data` exports (`CONTEXT_TOKEN_SUGGESTIONS`, the near-miss
 * map, and `isContextToken`, the membership predicate). Both are imports now.
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and why it is not a tautology
 *
 * The expectations below are a LITERAL TRANSCRIPTION of what the deleted local
 * copies did, taken at 567f370 before the swap. They are deliberately NOT read
 * back from the import that replaced them — an assertion shaped
 * `expect(imported).toEqual(imported)` passes no matter what the spec does, and
 * the whole risk of replacing a local definition with an imported one is that a
 * later spec release moves it underneath us.
 *
 * The import is used for ONE thing: to widen the candidate pool the cases are
 * driven over. That can only make this file stricter — a tenth near-miss
 * spelling added upstream enters the pool, warns, and fails the exact-set
 * assertion; a spelling dropped upstream stops warning and fails the same one.
 *
 * The surface under test is the resolver's OBSERVABLE behaviour (what comes
 * back, and what it warns), because that is what the two deleted symbols were
 * for. Neither was ever exported from `@object-ui/core`.
