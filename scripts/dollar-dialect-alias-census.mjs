 * `$`-dialect lowercase-alias census (objectui#8568).
 *
 * ## What this answers, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * objectui#8568 records that two files in `@object-ui/core` answer the same
 * `$`-dialect with two different acceptance sets, and that both answers are
 * deliberate. `convertFiltersToAST` (`packages/core/src/utils/filter-converter.ts`)
 * accepts four lowercase alias spellings "for tolerance"; `ValueDataSource`
 * refuses them by name as "non-canonical spellings", on objectui#8447's stated
 * reasoning that alias arms "would fossilise a second dialect".
 *
 * The card names three directions -- retire the converter's aliases, teach the
 * matcher the aliases, or keep both and document the split -- and rules on
 * none of them. It says the choice needs one number first:
 *
 *   > option 1's cost is entirely a function of how many authors are relying
 *   > on the tolerance, and nobody has measured that.
 *
 * THIS SCRIPT IS THAT MEASUREMENT AND NOTHING ELSE. It prints counts. It
 * repairs nothing, it changes no acceptance set, it is not wired into CI, and
 * it takes no position on which direction the number favours. That ruling is
 * reserved to objectui#8568 and to the maintainer.
 *
 * ## Why a `census:*` script and not a `check:*` gate
 *
 * The same reasoning `cross-file-line-citation-census.mjs` records for
 * objectui#8875, and for the same reason: `census:*` is this tree's existing
 * spelling for "runnable, reported, not blocking", so choosing it keeps the
 * change report-only without a reader having to take that on trust. A `check:*`
 * name invites the next sweep to wire it into a workflow and thereby to make
 * an undecided question blocking.
 *
 * ## The alias set is DERIVED, never listed here
 *
 * Writing the four spellings into this file would rebuild objectui#8568's own
 * defect one level up: a third hand-maintained copy of the dialect, which then
 * has to be edited whenever the map changes -- the edit everybody makes without
 * reading. So:
 *
 *   - the accepted set is read out of `operatorMap` in `filter-converter.ts`'s
 *     SOURCE (the same technique `readme-filter-operator-table.test.ts` uses,
 *     and for the same reason: the map is not exported);
 *   - the canonical set is read out of `@objectstack/spec`'s `FILTER_OPERATORS`;
 *   - the ALIASES are the difference.
 *
 * This matters most for the direction the card calls option 1. On a tree where
 * the aliases have been retired, the derived set is EMPTY and this census says
 * so, instead of going on grepping four spellings that no longer mean anything.
 *
 * ## The conflation this census exists to avoid
 *
 * There are TWO filter dialects in this repo and they are easy to read as one.
 *
 *   - the `$`-DIALECT -- `{ email: { $startsWith: 'a' } }` -- MongoDB-shaped
 *     operator KEYS, lowered by `convertFiltersToAST`. This is objectui#8568's
 *     subject and the only dialect this census counts.
 *   - the OBJECT-FORM / view-filter dialect -- `{ field, operator: 'startswith',
 *     value }` -- whose table is `FILTER_OPERATOR_ALIASES` in
 *     `packages/data-objectstack/src/index.ts`. That table is tolerant BY
 *     DESIGN and case-FOLDING by construction (`normalizeFilterOperator` calls
 *     `op.toLowerCase()` before the lookup), and it carries the bare spellings
 *     `startswith`, `endswith`, `notcontains`, `notin` as first-class members.
 *
 * A grep for `startswith` cannot tell the two apart, and the second dialect is
 * where nearly all of this repo's authored filters actually live. Reading its
 * rows as `$`-dialect reliance would make option 1 look expensive for filters
 * option 1 does not touch. So this census requires the `$` and requires an
 * operator-KEY position, and ships a control (`sibling-dialect`) that fails if
 * a bare row from that table is ever counted.
 *
 * ## Payload versus mention, because only one of them is an author
 *
 * Each occurrence is classified on two independent axes.
 *
 *   SHAPE. A PAYLOAD is the spelling in operator-key position -- `$notin:`,
 *   `'$notin':`, `"$notin":` -- or handed to the converter as its whole
 *   argument, `convertOperatorToAST('$notin')`. That is somebody writing a
 *   filter. A MENTION is every other occurrence: a backticked span in prose, a
 *   table cell, a comment, an `it.each([...])` roster. A mention is a claim
 *   ABOUT the dialect, not a use of it.
 *
 *   ROLE, from the path. `authored-corpus` is the population the card is
 *   asking about; `implementation` is the map itself; `converter-ledger` and
 *   `refusal-ledger` are the tests and READMEs that exist BECAUSE of the
 *   aliases and would have to be edited by whoever retires them -- real work,
 *   but not an author relying on tolerance; `release-notes` are dated records.
 *
 * Conflating the two axes is how a census of this shape over-reads: every
 * alias spelling in the tree today is either the map or something pointing at
 * the map, and a flat grep total makes that look like adoption.
 *
 * ## What this census CANNOT see -- which bounds every option's cost
 *
 * ⚠️ The number below is CONSUMER-LOCAL, not seam-wide. objectui#6839
 * established that distinction after "no producer emits X" was found true of
 * one helper's ten call sites and false of `ListView`. This repo is a
 * RENDERER: the filters it lowers are authored as METADATA, and the metadata
 * store is not in this tree. Specifically invisible from here:
 *
 *   - view / list-view / sharing-rule criteria stored in a deployment's
 *     database. `FilterConditionField` writes `criteria_json` into exactly such
 *     a store, and nothing in this repo can enumerate what is already in one;
 *   - seed, demo and app metadata that ships from `objectstack-ai/objectstack`
 *     or from any other producer repo;
 *   - filters assembled at runtime by application code outside this monorepo,
 *     including anything published `@object-ui/*` consumers write;
 *   - any filter whose operator key is COMPUTED (`{ [op]: value }`), which no
 *     static scan can resolve.
 *
 * A zero here therefore means "this repo's own authored corpus does not rely on
 * the tolerance". It does NOT mean "no author relies on the tolerance", and it
 * must not be quoted as if it did.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/dollar-dialect-alias-census.mjs
 *   node scripts/dollar-dialect-alias-census.mjs --json
 *   node scripts/dollar-dialect-alias-census.mjs --list-all

 *
 * ⚠️ The negative controls also measure that their BAIT still exists.
 * `sibling-dialect` counts the `$`-free rows in that file with a deliberately
 * `$`-less probe and fails when it finds NONE, because "the census counted zero
 * sibling rows" and "there are no sibling rows left to count" are the same
 * reading otherwise -- a check that passes because nothing is produced.
 *
 * ⚠️ What this control does NOT witness, measured by ablation rather than
 * assumed. The `$`-strictness lives in TWO layers: the literal prefilter in
 * `scanText` and the regexes it guards. Loosening the REGEX alone leaves this
 * control GREEN, because the prefilter has already excluded the file before the
 * regex runs. So the runtime control witnesses the COMPOSED scanner; the
 * `$`-strictness and case-sensitivity of the regexes themselves are pinned
 * directly on `scanText` in the suite, which is where a one-layer regression is
