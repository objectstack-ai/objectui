 *
 * `object-grid` — the four keys ruled NON-AUTHOR SURFACE stay unlisted, and
 * stay read (objectui#5091).
 *
 * ## The card, and the ruling
 *
 * objectui#5091 found four keys `ObjectGrid` reads through `(schema as any)`
 * that `GRID_QUERY_INPUTS` does not publish. `inputs` is not documentation: it
 * is the published AUTHORING surface, serialized by `sdui-parser`'s
 * `gen-manifest.ts` into `sdui.manifest.json` (the save gate and parser
 * whitelist) and into `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts`, and read by the designer panel.
 * A key the renderer honours and `inputs` omits therefore draws `unknown-prop`
 * from the parser on a key that works — objectui#4648's complaint.
 *
 * The maintainer ruled per key on 2026-08-18. THREE of them — `columnState`,
 * `hideRowHeightToggle`, `maxInlineRowActions` — are NOT authoring surface and
 * stay out of the manifest and the docs: a cast read of theirs is deliberate,
 * not missed. This file is where that word "deliberate" is said to the tooling,
 * so the next census re-files the card only if something really changed.
 *
 * ## The fourth key, and the reversal that settled it (2026-08-19)
 *
 * `rowActionDefs` was ruled the other way on 2026-08-18 — INTO the manifest, on
 * the reading that it is the symmetric partner of the declared
 * `bulkActionDefs`. That premise was falsified by measurement, and on
 * 2026-08-19 the maintainer KNOWINGLY REVERSED that one line: the key is
 * NON-AUTHOR SURFACE, same as the other three. The reversal was flagged as a
 * reversal when it was accepted, so a reader who finds the older ruling has
 * found history, not a contradiction. The three measurements it rests on:
 *
 *   - `app-shell/src/views/ObjectView.tsx:1968` DERIVES the grid's
 *     `rowActionDefs` from `objectDef.actions` filtered by
 *     `locations: ['list_item']`, while passing `bulkActionDefs` straight
 *     through from the view author twenty lines below. Asymmetric by
 *     construction — one is computed, the other authored.
 *   - The spec's `ObjectGridPropsSchema` is a `strictObject` that accepts
 *     `bulkActionDefs` and REJECTS `rowActionDefs` by name, so declaring it
 *     would publish a key the save gate refuses.
 *   - `@object-ui/types`' `ObjectGridSchema` declares `bulkActionDefs` and no
 *     `rowActionDefs` — which is why the read is a cast at all.
 *
 * So the authored way to put an action on a row stays what it already was: the
 * object's own action with `locations: ['list_item']`, plus the declared legacy
 * `rowActions` name list. `bulkActionDefs` keeps its job here as the DECLARED
 * CONTROL below — the one key of the pair that IS authoring surface, which is
 * what makes every "not published" assertion mean something.
 *
 * ## The shape of the pin — four assertions per key, and why each is needed
 *
 * Reusable as-is for the same census one and two packages over (objectui#5097
 * on `record:*` / `view:object`, objectui#5102):
 *
 *   1. NOT PUBLISHED, on every tag the renderer is registered under. One
 *      renderer registered twice is two chances to disagree with itself.
 *   2. THE CONTRACT REJECTS IT BY NAME. `ComponentPropsMap['object-grid']` is
 *      strict, so the key comes back in `unrecognized_keys` — asserted as a KEY
 *      verdict (the fixture is otherwise legal), never as a whole-document
 *      `success`, which would confuse "this key is refused" with "this document
 *      is well-formed". This is the half that makes the exemption checkable
 *      rather than an opinion: publishing the key would put the manifest at
 *      odds with the gate that stores the document.
 *   3. THE PARSER SAYS SO OUT LOUD, through the real validator over a manifest
 *      built from the LIVE registry — never a hand-written one that could agree
 *      with itself. `unknown-prop` on these keys is the intended, ruled outcome,
 *      not a defect; pinning it is what stops a later "tidy-up" from declaring
 *      them to silence a warning.
 *   4. THE RENDERER STILL READS IT. The ruling kept every read site; only the
 *      status changed. Deleting a read is the one move that would make an
 *      author's stored document quietly do nothing, and it is exactly what a
 *      reader who sees "non-author surface" might think is the tidy finish.
 *
 * The control in 1-3 is `bulkActionDefs`: declared, spec-accepted, clean
 * through the parser. Without it, all three assertions would pass just as
 * happily against a registry that published nothing at all.
 *
 * ## The fifth key the census found — and why it is NOT a fifth non-author key
 *
 * objectui#5240 filed `userActions` as a sixth cast-read grid key, on the
 * reading that it was one more "deliberately unlisted" surface with no
 * producer. Measurement refuted that, twice over, so the maintainer ruled on
 * 2026-08-20 (Q1=A · Q2=B · Q3=B) that the fix lands with the MEASURED reason
 * rather than the assumed one. What is actually wrong is a **name collision**:
 *
 *   - VIEW-level `userActions` is TOOLBAR POLICY — the spec's
 *     `UserActionsConfigSchema` (`sort`, `search`, `filter`, `refresh`,
 *     `rowHeight`, `addRecordForm`, `editInline`, `buttons`), which REJECTS
 *     `edit` BY NAME. `ListViewSchema` accepts it, so it is spec-legal, and it
 *     is really written: `app-shell`'s `ObjectView` builds one unconditionally.
 *     "Nobody authors it" was false. (A second producer,
 *     `SpecBridge.transformListView`, copied it onto the `object-grid` node
 *     until the whole spec-bridge was retired — objectui#6366, 2026-08-27
 *     maintainer ruling: zero measured consumers on every reachable endpoint.)
 *   - OBJECT-level `userActions` is the CRUD-PREDICATE block (`edit` /
 *     `delete` / `create` carrying `visibleWhen` / `disabledWhen`,
 *     objectui#2614) — the only shape `listViewPredicates` can read, since its
 *     loop skips every non-object value.
 *
 * `ObjectGrid` used to read the key VIEW-FIRST when harvesting predicate
 * fields for `$select`, so an authored toolbar block SHADOWED the object's CRUD
 * predicates and silently dropped their operands from the projection —
 * objectui#3501's fail-closed CEL fault (`No such key`), reached with a success
 * receipt. That read is now object-only, and both read sites carry the
 * collision comment.
 *
 * The pin below is therefore shaped differently from the four above: it does
 * NOT assert "no producer writes this" (two do) and it does not claim the key
 * is non-author surface. It asserts the four things the comments DO claim —
 * the two shapes, the producer, and the harvest's blindness to the toolbar
 * one — plus the renderer behaviour that shadowing broke. The RENDER channel of
 * the surviving object-block read is already pinned four times over by
 * `rowCrudEffectiveOps.test.tsx`'s `userActions` opt-out control group, so it
 * is cited here rather than duplicated.

// The SIXTH key the census reached — `onNavigate` — a NON-AUTHOR key that is
// nevertheless DECLARED, and the one callback the grid reads off the schema
// (objectui#5234, maintainer ruling 2026-08-19, Option C).
//
// ## Why it is not a sixth entry in NON_AUTHOR_KEYS above
//
// Those four are CAST reads: `@object-ui/types` does not declare them, which is
// what makes `(schema as any).key` the only way to read them. `onNavigate` is
// the opposite — it is an explicitly declared member of `ObjectGridSchema` with
// its own doc comment, so the read at the `useNavigationOverlay` call is plain.
//
// The card originally argued the reverse: that the key was ABSENT from the
// interface and type-checked only because `BaseSchema`'s `[key: string]: any`
// absorbed it. Its own author withdrew that on 2026-08-18 after re-measuring —
// the evidence had been a grep bounded to lines 532-760 of an interface that
// runs past 760. So `declaresOnNavigate` below is not decoration: it pins the
// corrected fact, and it is the assertion that would have stopped the original
// error. Do not re-describe this key as drift or as an oversight.
//
// ## What the ruling actually decided, and what pins it
//
// Option C: keep the declaration, keep the read, and SAY that it is an
// exception — an exemption comment at the read site in the shape PR #5241
// established for the four above, and a programmatic-only note on the type.
// Option A (remove the key) was rejected as a breaking public type change for
// zero measured harm; option B (declare it in `GRID_QUERY_INPUTS`) as
// publishing to the designer a key no author can ever express.
//
// That makes this card's deliverable PROSE, and prose is exactly what a pin
// normally cannot see. Every assertion about the world — not published, spec
// rejects it, parser says unknown-prop, the renderer still reads it, the type
// still declares it — was already TRUE before this card and stays true if its
// change is reverted. They are the ledger's premises and are pinned so the
// exemption cannot decay, but on their own they would pin nothing.
//
// So the two `documents its exemption` cases below read the SOURCE, the way
// `ObjectGrid.exportOptionsKeys.test.ts` in this directory does. They are the
// only assertions here that can tell the two states of the world apart, and
// they are anchored on text that exists in BOTH — the read line itself and the
// declaration line itself — so a failure means the comment went missing, never
// that the anchor moved.
