/**
 * Home's inbox / activity drills — which APP hosts them (objectui#4074).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * objectstack#7231 fixed ONE producer on this page (the pending-approvals card,
 * pinned next door in `HomePage.approvalsTarget.test.tsx`) and left its two
 * siblings hardcoding the same dead app:
 *
 *   - `onOpenNotification`'s FALLBACK branch → `/apps/setup/sys_inbox_message?view=mine`
 *   - `HomeActivity onViewAll`               → `/apps/setup/sys_activity`
 *
 * `sys_inbox_message` and `sys_activity` are framework-owned objects, reachable
 * at `/apps/{any app}/{object}` exactly like `system/approvals` — so naming
 * `setup` in the URL is a claim about the APP, not about the page. Two browser
 * verifications on the card measured what that claim costs: a business user
 * whose app list does not contain `setup` lands on "You don't have access", and
 * EVERY user is switched out of the app they were in (sidebar and app switcher
 * flip to Setup) with no announcement.
 *
 * ## What these cases assert, and what they deliberately do not
 *
 * They assert the RESOLVED TARGET — the argument `navigate()` receives. They say
 * nothing about what renders at the far end: objectstack#7344 (no shipped
 * permission set grants `sys_inbox_message`) is a second, independent cause, so
 * the destination may still show the no-access empty state after this fix. The
 * routing fix is necessary, not sufficient, and pinning the far end here would
 * pin someone else's defect.
 *
 * ## Scope of the stubs
 *
 * Same shape as `HomePage.approvalsTarget.test.tsx`: every hook `HomePage` calls
 * for an unrelated surface is stubbed at its module boundary, while `HomeRail` /
 * `HomeAppsStrip` — which own the buttons and their testids — stay real, because
 * "the click reaches the right URL" is not assertable through a stubbed button.

/* ── The `_drafts` double (objectui#7307) ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Every render of `HomePage` below mounts `PendingDraftsBanner`, which reads the
 * env-wide pending-draft count through `usePendingDrafts({})`. That hook fetches
 * `GET /api/v1/meta/_drafts` with the GLOBAL `fetch` — `usePendingDrafts.ts:48`,
 * no `apiFetch` seam anywhere on the path — from its mount effect
 * (`usePendingDrafts.ts:116` via `refresh` at `:94`). Under happy-dom that global
 * is a real HTTP client and the document URL defaults to `http://localhost:3000`,
 * so the relative path resolved to a live socket, once per case. The hook's read
 * is best-effort (its `catch` leaves `count` at `null`), which is why these cases
 * stayed green while the request always failed.
 *
 * Answered from a RECORDING double — the shape objectui#5225 settled on, carried
 * by `packages/plugin-report/src/__tests__/DatasetReportRenderer.test.tsx` and by
 * this burn-down's earlier batches. Deliberately NOT a blanket network stub: it
 * records every URL it is handed and `afterEach` fails on any URL outside the set
 * it serves, so an escape to somewhere else reds here instead of vanishing into
 * that `catch`.
 *
 * What it answers, and why that changes no assertion here: a known-EMPTY draft
 * ledger, in the `{ drafts: [...] }` envelope `fetchPendingDrafts` reads (the one
 * `MetadataClient.listDrafts` pins for this endpoint; the bare-array and
 * `{ data: { drafts } }` shapes parse to the same rows). Empty rather than seeded
 * is load-bearing: `PendingDraftsBanner` renders `null` when `(count ?? 0) <= 0`,
 * and the failing request produced `count === null` — so an empty ledger yields
 * byte-identical output to what these cases have always rendered, while a seeded
 * one would add a banner and a `pending-drafts-publish` button to every case's
 * tree. Routes are matched on the PATHNAME because the hook appends a
 * `?packageId=` scope for package-bound callers; the full URL is what gets
 * recorded.
