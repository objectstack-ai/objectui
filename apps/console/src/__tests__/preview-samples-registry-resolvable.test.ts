 *
 * `preview-samples.ts` page blocks ↔ `ComponentRegistry` resolvability
 * (objectui#3446).
 *
 * ## Why the spec guard is not enough
 *
 * `preview-samples-spec-valid.test.ts` already asks whether a sample would
 * survive being published. It cannot ask this question, and the gap is by
 * design rather than by oversight: `PageComponentSchema.type` is
 *
 *   z.union([ PageComponentType, z.string() ])
 *
 * — the enum OR any string, so that a page may host a block a plugin
 * registered outside the spec's own catalog. A misspelt or invented block type
 * is therefore perfectly valid metadata. `{ type: 'heading' }` parsed clean
 * through every spec release while resolving to nothing: `heading` has never
 * been registered in this repo (the nearest real things are `element:text`
 * with `variant: 'heading'`, which renders an h2, and the `ui/typography`
 * primitives, which never go through the registry at all). Both `heading`
 * nodes in the `page` sample fell through to the ComponentRegistry fallback,
 * so the gallery's page card — the worked example of a composed page — showed
 * two fallback boxes where its title and its section heading should have been.
 *
 * The samples are not fixtures. They are what an author (increasingly, a model
 * generating metadata) reads as "a page looks like this", so a block type that
 * resolves to nothing is a broken example that propagates. This test is the
 * missing half of that feedback loop: the spec guard pins the SHAPE, this one
 * pins that every type in the shape names something that can actually render.
 *
 * ## What resolvable means here
 *
 * `has(type) || hasLazy(type)` — a loaded registration or a pending
 * `registerLazy` stub. Both are legitimate: a lazily registered tag is a full
 * member of the contract and only differs by when its chunk is imported
 * (objectui#2953). `getConfig` would be the wrong probe for the same reason —
 * it is deliberately loaded-only.
 *
 * Registrations are read from the two module graphs the console actually boots
 * from (`@object-ui/components` + `../register-plugins`), the same posture as
 * `public-contract.test.ts` and `public-block-binding-reach.test.tsx`: a
 * hand-copied list of known types would agree with itself and prove nothing.
 *
 * ## Scope, stated so a pass is not over-read
 *
 * Resolvable is not the same as CORRECT. This asserts that a type names a real
 * renderer, not that the renderer reads the props the sample hands it — a
 * node can resolve and still render blank if its config sits under the wrong
 * key. That is a separate question, and the spec guard is what covers it from
 * the other side (the canonical bag is `properties`; `props` is rejected by
 * name under ADR-0089 D3a).
 *
 * Dashboard `widgets[]` are deliberately NOT walked. Those types are component
 * types too, but half of them (`metric`, `pivot`, …) are
 * registered only by `preview-gallery.tsx`'s own `registerLazy` block, and
 * that module mounts React at import time so a test cannot import it. Walking
 * them against this bootstrap would report unresolved types that resolve
 * perfectly well in the gallery, and re-declaring the gallery's list here
 * would be exactly the self-agreeing copy described above. The walk covers
 * page-component trees, which is where the objectui#3446 defect lived; the
 * dashboard sample is separately ledgered as KNOWN_STALE in the spec guard.
