 * check-registry-bare-name-collisions -- who governs a BARE registry key.

 *   node scripts/check-registry-bare-name-collisions.mjs            # the gate
 *   node scripts/check-registry-bare-name-collisions.mjs --table    # the measured population
 *   node scripts/check-registry-bare-name-collisions.mjs --json     # the same, machine-readable
 *
 * ## The hazard (objectui#9264)
 *
 * `Registry.register` writes a bare-name fallback ALONGSIDE the namespaced key
 * -- its own branch is `if (meta?.namespace && !meta?.skipFallback)` -- and the
 * bare write is last-one-wins. So when two registrations name the same bare
 * key with DIFFERENT full types, which declaration governs an authored
 * `{ "type": "<bare>" }` node depends on module import order. The symptom is
 * not an error: it is the wrong renderer, chosen by import order, for a node
 * that type-checks fine.
 *
 * Two things already exist and neither closes it:
 *
 *   - a RUNTIME warning in `Registry.register`, whose text begins "bare-name
 *     fallback is being overwritten by". It surfaces a collision in a browser
 *     console; it fails nothing, and `registerLazy` -- which takes the same
 *     `meta?.namespace && !meta?.skipFallback` branch -- has no guard at all.
 *   - `skipFallback: true`, the documented opt-out, applied case by case
 *     (`@object-ui/fields`' `FIELD_TYPES_SKIP_FALLBACK`, `record:line_items`,
 *     `ui:calendar`, the `plugin-grid` and `plugin-list` aliases). It is
 *     OPT-IN: a registration that forgets it takes the bare name silently.
 *
 * This gate is the missing half: a new contested bare key FAILS here.
 *
 * ## What counts as a collision, and what deliberately does not
 *
 * ⭐ The predicate is DISTINCT FULL TYPES, not "more than one registration".
 * This repository's normal shape is a console lazy stub and the plugin itself
 * claiming one bare key under the SAME full type -- the shape objectui#6416
 * converged `plugin-report` onto, and the reason
 * `report-bare-key-ownership.test.ts` replays registrations in both orders. A
 * bare key whose claimants all name one full type has ONE owner by
 * construction, whichever phase a host observes. Counting registrations rather
 * than declarations would report every one of those pairs as a defect.
 *
 * Three further dispositions are carried rather than filtered, because "did
 * not contest" and "was not seen" must never collapse into one answer:
 *
 *   - STOOD DOWN -- a namespaced registration with `skipFallback: true`. It
 *     would have claimed the bare name and declined. These are the cases the
 *     repository has ALREADY solved, and the gate's own controls require them
 *     to be visible: an instrument that cannot see a solved case cannot be
 *     trusted about an unsolved one.
 *   - GUARDED -- a registration inside `if (!ComponentRegistry.get(type))`,
 *     the placeholder registrar's shape. It writes the bare key only when
 *     nothing holds it, and a later real `register` overwrites it either way,
 *     so it never decides ownership.
 *   - OPEN -- a call whose key argument genuinely cannot be known statically
 *     (a registrar helper's parameter). Declared in `OPEN_REGISTRATION_SITES`
 *     with the reason, and each declared file must still contain such a call.
 *
 * ## Where the population comes from
 *
 * The AST half reuses `readRegistrationClaims` from
 * `scripts/unit-registry-collision.mjs` -- objectui#7134's walker, factored so
 * a caller that needs the CLAIMANT rather than the key does not need a second
 * walker over the same calls. The data-driven half (`registerAllFields()`
 * walks a map; the placeholder registrar walks an array) is not readable from
 * a call site at all, so it is taken from `INDIRECT_REGISTRATIONS` and
 * `deriveRegistryKeys` in `scripts/check-doc-component-types.mjs` -- the same
 * table `regenerate-known-schema-types.mjs` already follows, rather than a
 * third private list of collections that would drift.
 *
 * Tests are OUT of the population on purpose: a registration in a test body
 * happens when that test runs, in that worker's registry, and governs nothing
 * a host can author. objectui#7134's gate is the one that cares about those.
 *
 * ## The ledger
 *
 * `KNOWN_BARE_NAME_COLLISIONS` is SHRINK-ONLY, in the shape
 * `check-entry-guard`'s `KNOWN_HAND_TYPED_GUARDS` established: a contested key
 * that is not in it fails, a ledger entry whose claimants grew fails, and a
 * ledger entry that no longer collides fails as stale so a resolved collision
 * cannot leave a licence behind. Entries carry the CLAIMANTS, not just the
 * name, because objectui#9256's hold-outs have to be resolvable one at a time
 * and a bare key name resolves none of them.
 *
 * ⛔ Entries are keyed by file and full type, never by line number: a stored
 * line address is a key that rots on the next insertion above it (AGENTS.md
 * section 5, commandment #11). Line numbers are printed as diagnostics, which
 * are computed every run and cannot expire.
 *
 * ⛔ Adding `skipFallback: true` to a registration to empty this ledger is a
 * BEHAVIOUR change -- it decides which renderer a bare name resolves to. Each
 * one needs its own ruling; objectui#9256 holds eleven registrations for
 * exactly that reason. This gate makes those decidable. It does not decide
 * them.
