     * Nothing threw, `openManage`'s catch never ran, and the management sheet

     * objectui#7821 (PR #7879), one seam over.
     *
     * Measured on this path, not assumed. `GET /api/v1/packages` is served by
     * the direct-mount registrar (`@objectstack/rest` `package-routes.ts`,
     * which mounts FIRST in the production stack), and `check:route-envelope`
     * pins that module at zero hand-written bodies: every failure leaves
     * through the shared `sendError` / `sendThrownError`. The reachable

     *
     * So the envelope's own `success` is NOT a second bit to read here: `sendOk`
     * writes `true` on every 2xx and the error writers write `false` on every
     * non-2xx, which makes it `!res.ok` restated. `res.ok` is the DECISION; the
     * envelope is read for the WORDS, which is the half that needs it — in the
     * 5xx band the platform withholds the producer's prose and answers the
     * generic `Internal server error`, leaving `error.code` as the only
     * discriminating word, so the code travels with the message.
     *
     * The one other shape a browser can meet is a non-JSON error body (a
     * proxy's HTML 502/504). `res.json()` rejects on it — which the caller
     * already reported, as a JSON syntax error — so the tolerant read below

       * `error.message` and `error.code` and stopped, so a marked sentence
       * arrived on the wire and had nowhere to appear.

       * theoretical. That door withholds the producer's PROSE and substitutes
       * the generic `Internal server error` into `error.message` — but the
       * withhold rewrites a local `message` const and `looksLikeInternalErrorLeak`

       * ⛔ NOT scoped to 5xx, deliberately. The marked channel is

       * a consumer that honoured it only in one band would re-create, on the
       * reading end, precisely the divergence that door refused to create on
       * the writing end. A 4xx `message` is already caller-facing by design;
       * when a producer ALSO marked a text there, the mark is the more
       * specific answer to "what should this person read", and the diagnostic
       * it displaces is not lost to diagnosis — `code` still travels below.
       *
       * ⛔ Not a tolerant alias ladder either: these are two DECLARED fields
       * with different meanings, not two spellings of one. An unmarked refusal
       * carries no `userMessage` at all (the producer's `declaredUserMessage`

     * The managed snapshot behind the OPEN sheet (objectui#7907). A lifecycle
     * action has just run — disable / enable / duplicate / publish /
     * publish-drafts / manifest edit — so the record in `manage` is ALREADY
     * known to be out of date, and this read is what replaces it. Neither way
     * it can fail may be silent, and neither may leave the PRE-ACTION record on
     * screen as though it were current.
     *
     * The arm this replaces was `catch {}` under a comment reading "keep the
     * current snapshot" — true of what it did, and the reason it was wrong:
     * the author disabled the package, was told nothing, and went on reading
     * `Status: Enabled`. ⚠️ It is a PRE-EXISTING defect that objectui#7881
     * (PR #7906) made much easier to hit, NOT a regression from it: before that
     * card `fetchFullPackage` never read `res.ok`, so this catch could only
     * ever see a `res.json()` rejection; now that the helper refuses a non-2xx,
     * the same catch also swallows every 401 / 403 / 503 / 500. Fixing one
     * swallowing site made the next swallowing site swallow more.
     *
     * ⛔ Why the sheet CLOSES rather than staying open on the stale record.
     * `PackageDetailSheet` is an ACTION surface, and it derives its verb from
     * the record it was handed: `enabled = pkg.enabled !== false && pkg.status
     * !== 'disabled'` picks both the button's label and the endpoint it POSTs
     * (`.../${enabled ? 'disable' : 'enable'}`, `PackagesPage.tsx`). Left open
     * over a snapshot we KNOW is pre-action, it does not merely display a stale
     * badge — it re-arms the author with the verb they just fired. Closing it
     * is still a DEGRADATION and not a throw (objectui#7368's standing ruling
     * — one 503 must not take the Studio down): the editor, the top bar and
     * the package list all stay, and reopening the sheet re-runs this same read
     * one click away, which objectui#7881 taught to report its own outcome.
     *
     * ⛔ `manage` is deliberately NOT nulled — a null `pkg` with `manageOpen`
     * still true is precisely the stuck state objectui#7881 fixed, and the next
     * `openManage` overwrites the record anyway.
     *
     * ⛔ Not recorded in `pkgsErr` either, and this arm was MEASURED rather
     * than inherited: that slot is the switcher LIST's state and is written
     * exactly where `pkgs` is — the mount effect and the HEAD of this callback,
     * the only two sites that write either. This TAIL writes neither; it writes
     * `manage`. The head has just recorded the list's own verdict (a fresh list
     * and `null`, or its failure), so writing `pkgsErr` from here would mark
     * the trigger `failed` over names the head refreshed successfully a moment
     * ago — the same lie as objectui#7368's, pointed the other way.
     *
     * ⛔ And no navigation: a snapshot this read could not deliver is not
     * evidence of deletion (objectui#7821). Reporting is not inferring.

 * writes `{ type: 'object', objectName }` (which the runtime resolves to that
 * object's record list) and, if the label is still the placeholder, adopts the
 * object's label. The comment used to say it writes `{ object }` — the bare
 * spelling `AppSchema` answers with `unrecognized_keys`; the code has always
 * written the canonical key and cleared `object` (objectui#4881).
 *
 * Exported for tests (`StudioDesignSurface.navItemInspector.test.tsx`) — the

 *
 * Exported for tests (StudioDesignSurface.gridRefresh.test.tsx) — the refresh
 * channel this slot rides is a property of THIS function's schema forward, so
 * the test drives the real slot rather than a reconstruction of it. It is a
 * render-prop callback rather than a component, so Fast Refresh cannot treat it
 * as one; the export is scoped to that test and never reaches the package entry
 * (`index.ts` re-exports a named list, and `package.json` exports only `.`).

 * `name` / `enabled` / `bound` required, and the reads below narrow each one
 * explicitly (`if (s?.name)`, `s.enabled !== false`, `!!s.bound`) instead of
 * trusting the type. Pinned in `spec-symbol-parity.test.ts`: if the spec ever

 * Scope note (ADR-0086 P0/P1/P2): the pillar is scoped to the current package.

 * `member_default`, …) are excluded by the backend. The object MATRIX lists only
 * the objects this package declares, and Save merges just that slice back,
 * leaving other packages' contributed rows untouched (P0). Save writes a package
 * DRAFT and publishes with the whole package via the top-bar Publish (P2, D6).
