/**
 * objectui#9336 — the flow `end` node's `config.message`, the key
 * `outcome: 'refused'` REQUIRES and `outcome: 'completed'` REFUSES.
 *
 * `EndConfigSchema` cross-validates the pair in BOTH directions through a
 * `superRefine`. The form offered a typed control for `outcome` (objectui#9278
 * made it a closed two-option dropdown) and NONE for `message`, so the most
 * direct route through the repaired control — pick `refused`, save — produced a
 * flow that fails to load. That is a BLOCKED AUTHORING PATH, not a missing
 * nicety, and it is the shape these rows pin: not "a field exists" but "the
 * outcome an author can pick is one they can then satisfy".
 *
 * ## What makes each reading a reading rather than a dead probe
 *
 * Every negative here is paired with a lit control differing in exactly one
 * way, because a zero whose control is also dead proves nothing:
 *
 *  - the spec rows print BOTH signs from one parse: `refused` alone is refused,
 *    `refused` + `message` is accepted, and `completed` + `message` is refused.
 *    An accept-only loop would pass against a schema that accepts everything.
 *  - the "hidden on a completed end" row is paired with the SAME query finding
 *    the SAME control on a refused end — so an absence is a gate, never a
 *    renderer that drew nothing (objectui#8350's lesson).
 *  - the queries proving `message` absent are paired with `Outcome`, which is
 *    present in every one of those renders.
 *
 * ## The gate, and why it is `showWhen` rather than an always-on field
 *
 * An always-on `message` box would trade this defect for the contract's OTHER
 * direction: a completion carrying a message is refused just as loudly. The
 * descriptor is therefore gated on the controller, and the two halves that make
 * the pair fully authorable are both pinned below — the field is OFF while the
 * outcome resolves to `completed` (through the declared default, on an unset
 * key), and a STORED message re-shows it anyway, which is the only way an
 * author can clear a stale message after switching back.
 *
 * ⛔ These rows pin the CONTRACT's direction, not this file's taste. Every
 * expectation about what the schema accepts is derived from the installed
 * `EndConfigSchema` at run time, never from a literal restated here.
