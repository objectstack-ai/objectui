/**
 * objectui#9003 — a pending changeset's prose is judged by nothing.
 *
 * A `.changeset/*.md` body publishes VERBATIM into the CHANGELOG at the next
 * release, and between authoring and release nothing re-reads it when a later
 * merge falsifies it. This gate does not judge whether the prose is true — it
 * judges whether the body NAMES a file this change touches, and hands the
 * paragraph to the one seat that can answer the truth question cheaply.
 *
 * What this file pins, in the order the gate can fail:
 *
 *  1. **It can start on the pull request that needs it.** The falsifying change
 *     is an ordinary source change, so the gate lives in the workflow with NO
 *     path filter. That absence is the load-bearing property and is pinned here:
 *     adding a `paths:` filter to that workflow would blind this gate silently,
 *     which is the exact failure mode `changeset-guard.yml` can afford and this
 *     one cannot.
 *  2. **Both directions of the verdict**, against throwaway repositories rather
 *     than this one's history, so they stay decidable when the history moves. A
 *     report that fires, and a FIRING CONTROL — the same fixture with the named
 *     file left alone — so a green can never come from the gate looking at
 *     nothing.
 *  3. **The exclusions are deliberate, not accidents.** A changeset this change
 *     ADDS is never reported BY THE WENT-FALSE HALF. ⚠️ That is no longer the
 *     same sentence as "the gate is blind to BORN FALSE": objectui#9509 added a
 *     second reading with its own corpus and its own coordinate, and section 6
 *     below pins it. The exclusion itself is unchanged and still load-bearing. A
 *     changeset declaring no bump is never reported: its body never publishes.
 *     An ambiguously-named file is never reported: a span resolving to many
 *     files names none of them.
 *  4. **It can never block.** There is no enforcing switch, deliberately: a
 *     pending changeset naming a file you edited is usually still true.
 *  5. **Every missing input fails LOUD.** Report-only means the gate declines to
 *     fail on its FINDINGS — never that it passes without looking
 *     (objectstack#4928, objectui#4690).

// ── 7. the SELF-CONTRADICTION reading (objectui#9841) ────────────────────────
//
// One changeset read against ITSELF: a package its own front matter declares,
// negated in its own body. The four structural changeset gates judge the front
// matter; the two readings above judge a body against a diff; nothing read the
// two halves of one file against each other.
//
// What these cases pin, in the order this reading can fail:
//
//  1. It FIRES on the carded shape, and stays SILENT on the repair that landed
//     on the same pull request — the discrimination the whole coordinate rests
//     on.
//  2. BORN FALSE and WENT FALSE are DIFFERENT ANSWERS, decided from the branch's
//     own revisions. The carded sentence was TRUE when written, and a gate that
//     reported it as false-when-written would be making an accusation the
//     history refutes.
//  3. TWO DISTINCT FLOORS (objectui#9744). A `0` from a reader that read nothing
//     and a `0` from a clean corpus are the same character, so neither may print
//     what the other prints, and neither may print the clean tick.
//  4. HERMETICITY IS STRUCTURAL. This reading takes no ambient input, and a
//     poisoned `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` cannot move a byte of its section.
