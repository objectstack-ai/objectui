/**
 * Declare an ADR-0049 RETIREMENT TOMBSTONE: a key that stays declared but is
 * unwritable, so an authored value is REFUSED loudly instead of being silently
 * stripped the way an undeclared key would be (the convention `crud.zod.ts`
 * `confirm` established; objectui#5474's ruling records loud refusal as the
 * intended outcome).
 *
 * `guidance` is written ONCE and carried into BOTH author-facing channels:
 *
 *   1. `.describe()` — schema METADATA, which feeds generated JSON-Schema and
 *      the docs surface. This is where the text already lived.
 *   2. `z.never({ error })` — the parse-time ISSUE MESSAGE, which is what an
 *      author who trips the tombstone actually reads. Without it zod emits its
 *      own generic `"Invalid input: expected never, received string"`, which
 *      names WHICH key is wrong (via the issue path) but says nothing about why
 *      it was retired or what to write instead — so half of the loud refusal's
 *      payload was being dropped (objectui#6105). `DashboardConfigSchema.aria`
 *      (`complex.zod.ts`, objectui#5852) landed the spelling by hand first;
 *      this is that spelling as one shared mechanism.
 *
 * ONE argument feeding TWO channels is the point: the message an author reads
 * and the text generated docs publish cannot drift apart, because there is only
 * one string.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT change: the accept set
 *
 * `z.never({ error })` customises the MESSAGE only. The issue `code` stays
 * `invalid_type` and the issue `path` still names the key — exactly what a bare
 * `z.never()` reports — and `z.input` still types the key `never`, so `tsc`
 * refuses it at the authoring site before anything runs. Nothing that parsed
 * green parses red, or the reverse. Pinned member-by-member against the
 * pre-change readings in `../__tests__/static-table-narrow-surface.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Not `@objectstack/spec`'s `retiredKey`
 *
 * The spec has a same-shaped helper (`shared/retired-key.ts`) for keys removed
 * from the SPEC, and it deliberately prefixes its describe text with
 * `[REMOVED] `. This one must not: these describe strings are already-published
 * metadata and stay byte-identical through this conversion. Same shape,
 * different describe contract — do not swap one for the other.
 *
 * Internal to this package's zod modules — deliberately NOT re-exported from
 * `index.zod.ts`, since nothing outside `@object-ui/types` declares these
 * schemas.

 * The mirrors declared 58 handler keys as `z.function()` — a declaration no
 * JSON document can satisfy on a JSON-authored vocabulary. Deleting them was
 * measured and refused: `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`, so an undeclared key
 * is not refused, it is KEPT, and `onClick` rides `SDUI_DOM_PASS_THROUGH_KEYS`
 * into the DOM listener slot where React throws at click. So the key stays
 * DECLARED and refuses BY NAME, in the shape #5099 landed for
 * `FieldConstraintsSchema.pattern.value` (`form.zod.ts`): a `z.custom`
 * predicate whose message names the key, says why JSON cannot author it, and
 * points at the spelling that runs — the node-type form PR #6498 established.
 *
 * The predicate refuses EVERYTHING, a live function included. The JSON face
 * has no function value, and the programmatic face reaches renderers through
 * the TypeScript interface and React props, never through `safeParse`; a
 * function that parsed green here was only ever the instrument's positive
 * control. That is the accept-set change objectui#6124's changeset declares.

 * Same discipline as {@link retirementTombstone}: ONE string feeds BOTH
 * author-facing channels — the parse-time issue message and the `.describe()`
 * metadata — so they cannot drift apart. Deliberately NOT that helper: a
 * tombstone retires a key from the contract on both faces and reports
 * `invalid_type`; this arm reports `custom` (the #5099 code) and, for a

/**
 * Declare a NAMED ALIAS REFUSAL ARM: a key that is a sibling SPELLING of a

 * instead of being STRIPPED in silence by a non-strict `z.object`
 * (objectui#7694, `domain:ui` PM ruling on objectui#7546: option A). The lead
 * sentence is the one `@objectstack/spec`'s `strictObject({ aliases })` answers
 * with, so an author meets the same remedy on both faces:
 *
 *     Unrecognized key(s) on this chart series: `chartType`. Did you mean
 *     `chartType` → `type`? …
 *
 * The third member of this file's family, and deliberately neither of the
 * other two by NAME — while sharing {@link retirementTombstone}'s PRIMITIVE:
 *
 *   - not {@link retirementTombstone} by name: that helper's guidance is a
 *     MIGRATION NOTE for a key the contract is withdrawing (ADR-0049), while an
 *     alias arm's guidance has to carry the canonical spelling instead.
 *     ⚠️ What separates the two is NOT declaration history. Measured on this
 *     tree: `MenuItemSchema.type` (`overlay.zod.ts:196`, objectui#6523) is a
 *     `retirementTombstone` whose own guidance reads "`type` ('separator' or
 *     'label') was an undeclared spelling two renderers used to read and is now
 *     a declared refusal, not a strip", and `overlay.ts:458-464` states it
 *     again ("a spelling the type never declared"). A never-declared,
 *     renderer-read spelling turned into a named refusal pointing at the
 *     canonical key therefore ALREADY had a precedent in this package, and it
 *     was filed under `retirementTombstone`.
 *     What is new here is the MESSAGE: this helper composes the lead sentence
 *     `@objectstack/spec`'s `strictObject({ aliases })` answers with, so one
 *     remedy meets the author on both faces. Same `z.never` primitive, same
 *     `invalid_type` code, a three-line composer — a VOCABULARY, not a shape.
 *   - not {@link handlerKeyRefusal}: that says why JSON cannot author a
 *     function-valued key; an alias has a perfectly authorable value under the
 *     other name. And not its `z.custom` primitive either — measured:
 *     `z.toJSONSchema` THROWS on a `z.custom` arm ("Custom types cannot be
 *     represented in JSON Schema") and represents a `z.never` arm as
 *     `{ not: {} }` carrying the description. `z.toJSONSchema(ChartDataSeriesSchema)`
 *     succeeded before the first alias arm landed and goes on succeeding.
 *   - not a FOLD (`.overwrite()`, the shape `foldChartXAxisAlias` takes in
 *     `data-display.zod.ts`): a fold is only honest where the canonical key is
 *     the READER's first limb, so "canonical wins when both are written" restates
 *     a precedence already running. Where the reader takes the ALIAS first, a
 *     fold would let it overwrite the canonical key; the refusal is the shape
 *     there (objectui#7113's precedence rule, not inverted).
 *
 * Same discipline as its siblings: ONE string feeds BOTH author-facing
 * channels — the parse-time issue message and the `.describe()` metadata — so
 * they cannot drift apart. The issue `code` is `invalid_type` at the key's own
 * path, `z.input` is `undefined`, so the TypeScript twin is a `?: never`
 * tombstone and the pair does not drift in `zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`.
 * Pinned in `../__tests__/chart-series-chart-type-alias-refusal-7694.test.ts`.
 *
 * @param alias     the refused spelling, spelled into the message so the issue
 *                  is addressed even when read without its path
 * @param canonical the declared member the author meant
 * @param surface   the object being authored, phrased as the spec phrases it
 *                  (`'this chart series'`)

/**
 * Declare a RETIRED NODE TYPE arm: a component `type` literal the vocabulary no
 * longer serves, kept in the discriminated union ONLY so an authored document
 * naming it is refused BY NAME and pointed at the surviving spelling
 * (objectui#8802, maintainer ruling 2026-09-09).
 *
 * ## Why an arm rather than a deletion — and why that is not the passthrough rule
 *
 * The family's other three retirements in that batch (`gantt` objectui#8008,
 * `kanban-ui` / `kanban-enhanced` objectui#8257) are registration-only: no
 * schema face ever declared them, so unregistering IS the retirement. This
 * helper exists for the fourth case, where a face DID declare the literal.
 *
 * ⚠️ Two different mechanisms, and conflating them is how a retirement ships as
 * a silent accept:
 *
 *   - a dropped MEMBER key is KEPT, not refused — {@link retirementTombstone}'s
 *     whole reason, because `BaseSchemaCore` ends `.passthrough()`;
 *   - a dropped TYPE LITERAL on a DISCRIMINATED union IS refused, because
 *     `AnyComponentSchema` selects one arm from the authored literal and an
 *     unclaimed literal matches none.
 *
 * ⇒ Deleting the arm would already refuse. What it would NOT do is say why, or
 * what to write instead: the union answers a missed discriminator with its own
 * `Invalid input`, naming no remedy. Measured on zod 4.4.3: an arm carrying the
 * literal plus a failing check reports `custom` at `path: ['type']` with this
 * guidance, while the same document against a union without the arm reports
 * `invalid_union` / "No matching discriminator" and nothing else.
 *
 * ⛔ Not {@link retirementTombstone}: that helper's `z.never()` sits at a MEMBER
 * position inside an arm. A discriminated union needs the arm itself to claim
 * the literal (`propValues`), so the refusal has to be a check on the object,
 * not a member type.
 *
 * Same discipline as its three siblings in this file: ONE string feeds BOTH
 * author-facing channels — the parse-time issue message and the `.describe()`
 * metadata — so they cannot drift apart.
 *
 * @param type     the retired literal, spelled into the message so the issue is
 *                 addressed even when read without its path
 * @param guidance why it retired and what to author instead
