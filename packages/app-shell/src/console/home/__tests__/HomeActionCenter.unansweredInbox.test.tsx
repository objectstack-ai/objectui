/**
 * #4235 — Home's action centre said "You're all caught up" to a user with nine
 * unread messages, and showed no badge.
 *
 * ## What the card reported, and what it actually was
 *
 * The card read the symptom as a WRONG SOURCE: `useHomeInbox` polls
 * `sys_inbox_message` rather than `/api/v1/notifications`. Measured, the source
 * is right and sanctioned. ADR-0030 names the table read as the consumer
 * channel in three places — the L5 row of its object model ("**the bell reads
 * `sys_inbox_message`**"), the P0 phase ("UI bell reads `sys_inbox_message`"),
 * and the cross-repo cut-over ("Repoint the Console bell … to
 * **`sys_inbox_message`** (the `mine` view), joining `sys_notification_receipt`
 * for read-state") — and `/api/v1/notifications` is a PROJECTION of those very
 * rows: `MessagingService.listInbox` reads `sys_inbox_message` where
 * `user_id`, ordered `created_at desc`, joined with the same receipts. Reading
 * the table is reading the API's own source, one hop earlier.
 *
 * ## The condition that decided it — and it is not staleness
 *
 * Two QA runs on the SAME console pin `09987b68` recorded opposite things:
 * objectstack#7514 saw this panel empty with 9 unread, objectstack#7517 used it
 * as the WORKING control against the dead bell. Both are true, of different
 * users. objectstack#7344 measured the mechanism in a browser on 2026-08-10:
 *
 *     [Security] Access denied: operation 'find' on object 'sys_inbox_message'
 *     is not permitted for positions [org_member, contributor, finance, everyone]
 *
 * — every inbox read `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` for a plain member, because no
 * shipped permission set granted the object, while `/api/v1/notifications`
 * (a dedicated authenticated route, not the generic data API) answered with
 * their unread rows. An admin session read the table and the card worked. So
 * the flip is the SIGNED-IN USER'S PERMISSION SET, not the console build.
 *
 * The 403 itself is closed server-side by objectstack#7586 (owner-scoped member
 * grants, merged 2026-08-11). What is NOT closed, and is what these cases pin,
 * is that the console turned that denial into good news: `useHomeInbox` caught
 * every failure to `[]`, and `HomeActionCenter` renders the affirmative empty
 * copy on an empty array. Any future denial, outage or malformed answer
 * reproduces the identical silent lie — the grant fixed one cause of a symptom
 * that had no cause-independent guard.
 *
 * ## The oracle
 *
 * Real `useHomeInbox` + real `HomeActionCenter`, wired as `HomePage` wires them,
 * against a fake adapter. Nothing about the REST layer is pinned here — the
 * adapter boundary is where a denial becomes a rejected promise, and that is the
 * hop under test.
