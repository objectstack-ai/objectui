/**
 * Every `${…}` a json fence authors on a node must sit on a channel
 * `SchemaRenderer` actually evaluates. REPORT-ONLY: it prints a census and never
 * fails the build on its findings.
 *
 * The scan surface is EXACTLY the one `check:doc-types`
 * (`check-doc-component-types.mjs`) walks — `content/docs`, every
 * `apps/<app>/docs` tree and the root pages it names — and it is that surface by
 * IMPORT rather than by copy; see "The scan surface" below.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-doc-expression-carriage.mjs
 *       node scripts/check-doc-expression-carriage.mjs --list       every fence, parsed or not
 *       node scripts/check-doc-expression-carriage.mjs --self-test  the controls alone
 * Exit: 0 = the census ran, whatever it found. 1 = the INSTRUMENT is broken —
 *       a derivation returned nothing, the spec artifact is missing, or a
 *       built-in control failed. Never 1 for a finding; see "Report-only" below.
 *
 * ## The hole this measures (objectui#7851)
 *
 * A json fence in these pages can author ANY key at all on a node and no gate
 * objects. Only the `type` string is judged:
 *
 *   - `check-doc-component-types` scans these pages and judges every `type`
 *     literal. Its own header states the exclusion in as many words: "NOT in
 *     scope, deliberately: whether the snippet's OTHER keys are read by the
 *     renderer the type resolves to."
 *   - `check-doc-snippet-types` covers these pages too, but type-checks `ts` /
 *     `tsx` blocks only. A json fence is never compiled against anything.
 *
 * ⇒ Between them the `type` is checked, the ts/tsx is checked, and the json
 * fence bodies are unchecked. Four cards of exactly that shape were each found
 * by a human or an agent re-reading a page, never by CI: objectui#7418
 * (`guide/expressions.md` authored `${…}` on six keys with no carriage row —
 * one of them, `badge.text`, is not a `BadgeSchema` key at all and rendered an
 * EMPTY badge), objectui#7440, objectui#7444, objectui#7838.
 *
 * ## What this answers, and the half it does NOT
 *
 * This file answers the EXPRESSION half only: *is this key evaluated?* It is
 * the cheap half, and the only one derivable from an artifact today. The wider
 * half — is this key READ BACK by the renderer the type resolves to, which is
 * what objectui#7440 and objectui#7444 are — needs the per-renderer read-point
 * contract `check-doc-component-types` names as the missing piece. ⛔ Do not
 * read a green census here as "the fences are correct"; read it as "no fence
 * authors an expression on a channel nothing evaluates".
 *
 * ## Report-only, and what would justify flipping it
 *
 * The 2026-09-06 dispatch ruling on objectui#7851: this class has four known
 * members and three of them are OPEN, so a blocking gate would go red on other
 * people's cards the day it landed and turn one card into four. The census IS
 * the deliverable — how many fences exist, how many carry an uncarried
 * expression, and on which pages — and that number is what decides later
 * whether the corpus gets cleaned first or a ledger gets built. ⛔ This file
 * does not make that decision.
 *
 * Same posture as `check-changeset-overwrite.mjs`, and the same boundary:
 * report-only means it declines to fail on its FINDINGS, never that it passes
 * without looking (objectstack#4928, objectui#4690). A broken derivation, an
 * unreadable input or a failed control is exit 1 — a gate that runs, goes
 * green and looked at nothing is the counterfeit this whole file guards
 * against, so it is exactly the thing that must be loud.
 *
 * ## Where the evaluated-channel universe comes from — derived, never a list
 *
 * A hand-typed list of "keys the renderer evaluates" would be a second dialect
 * of a declaration that already exists twice over, and it would rot silently in
 * the direction that produces FALSE FINDINGS on correct docs. So both halves
 * are re-derived on every run, and each one fails the gate rather than
 * shrinking if it stops matching:
 *
 *   CARRIAGE  `expressionBindableTextKeysFor(type)` out of the BUILT
 *             `@objectstack/spec` artifact — the same lookup
 *             `packages/react/src/SchemaRenderer.tsx` consumes. Read from the
 *             artifact rather than from prose or a table, which is the
 *             derivation objectui#7418 established and its triage seat asked
 *             every later reader to repeat rather than copy: the spec version
 *             moves.
 *   CHANNELS  the four legs `SchemaRenderer` evaluates, read off that file's
 *             own call sites — `evaluator.evaluate(newSchema.<key>)` (the
 *             `content` leg), `isConfigBag(newSchema.<key>)` (the `properties`
 *             and `props` bags), and
 *             `evaluate{Visibility,Enablement}Predicate(newSchema.<key>, …)`
 *             (the eight condition keys). Read from `run`-shaped call sites,
 *             never from the surrounding comments: that file's prose names
 *             `visibleOn`, `disabled` and the bags many times over, and a scan
 *             of the raw text would be describing its own docblocks.
 *
 * A node's carried set is the union of the two, and a node whose `type` has no
 * carriage row simply gets the channel keys — which is the point: `badge`,
 * `progress`, `input` and `list` carry NOTHING, so every `${…}` those nodes
 * author outside `content`, the bags and the condition keys is a finding.
 *
 * ## The parse surface is reported, because it is this instrument's blind spot
 *
 * A fence this file cannot parse is a fence it says nothing about, and a census
 * that reports only its hits hides how much it never read. So every run prints
 * `parsed` and `unparsed` PER FENCE LANGUAGE (`json` and `jsonc` today) and
 * names every unparsed fence with its reason; `--list` prints the whole
 * inventory, parsed and unparsed alike.
 * objectui#7418's prototype reached 0 unparsed on `guide/expressions.md`
 * (39 of 39); this file reaches 0 unparsed over the whole tree, which takes
 * four tolerances beyond `JSON.parse`, all of them REMOVALS of non-data or an
 * envelope around it. None of them can invent a key:
 *
 *   1. Line comments and block comments outside strings. The pages annotate
 *      their examples this way.
 *   2. Raw newlines and tabs inside strings, re-escaped. These pages write
 *      multi-line ternaries inside a single `${…}` string.
 *   3. Trailing commas before `}` / `]`.
 *   4. Elision markers, in the three spellings the corpus uses — a bare `...`
 *      or `…` token, and a `"..."` STRING standing in a member position (never
 *      one in a value position, which is a real placeholder value, e.g.
 *      `"placeholder": "..."`).
 *
 * Plus one retry, not a tolerance: a fence that is an object BODY rather than
 * an object (`"dependencies": { … }`, a package.json excerpt) is retried
 * wrapped in braces.
 *
 * And one normalization that is NOT on the judged path at all — `toJsonDialect`,
 * which de-dialects a JS object literal (unquoted keys, single-quoted strings)
 * so the BLIND-SPOT measurement can ask its question of that spelling too
 * (objectui#8334). ⛔ It never runs on a judged fence: `analyze` reaches it only
 * from the `!fence.scanned` branch, so the judged population is byte-for-byte
 * what it was before that card. ⛔ And it is emphatically NOT a step toward
 * adding `plaintext` to `JSON_FENCE_LANGUAGES` — that was considered and
 * REJECTED by content on PR objectui#8324, because `plaintext` is not a JSON
 * dialect and admitting it lets every future JSON-in-plaintext block through
 * unjudged. The fix for a blind measurement is to make it see, not to make the
 * census swallow what it cannot judge.
 *
 * ## What it does not see, stated so nobody mistakes it for coverage
 *
 *   - A `${…}` inside an ARRAY on a node key (`"items": ["${a}"]`). Only string
 *     values directly on a node are judged.
 *   - A `${…}` in an object with no string `type`. Without a type there is no
 *     carriage row to judge against, and guessing one is how a gate produces
 *     false findings in both directions at once.
 *   - Anything outside a `json` / `jsonc` fence on the scan surface. The
 *     `ts`/`tsx` blocks are `check-doc-snippet-types`' surface and are left to
 *     it; ⛔ this file changes no other gate's population. The LANGUAGE SET is its
 *     own blind spot and is measured rather than asserted: every run prints the
 *     per-language counts, and every fence in a language this gate does not scan
 *     is still read, purely to report whether it holds a typed node.
 *     ⚠️ objectui#8334: "read" used to mean `JSON.parse`, and that made the
 *     measurement blind to the JS OBJECT-LITERAL spelling — a fence authoring a
 *     real node tree with unquoted keys landed in NEITHER the judged population
 *     nor the blind-spot list, and the summary printed `none` over it. Both
 *     spellings are asked now; see `toJsonDialect`. ⛔ This did not widen the
 *     census: the judged population is still `json` / `jsonc` and nothing else.
 *   - The repository-root `docs/` tree, and therefore `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` —
 *     objectui#7838's site. ⚠️ objectui#7878 was filed expecting this widening to
 *     reach that file; it does not, and the card's premise was corrected before
 *     dispatch rather than after. NO doc gate walks the root `docs/` tree
 *     (objectui#7856 is the open question about it): `check-doc-component-types`
 *     names `docs/**` in its own exclusion list, `check-readme-exports` reports
 *     `0 outside any package`, and `lint:root` ignores it. Widening onto a tree
 *     no sibling gate reads is a different decision from joining the surface
 *     three of them already share, and it is #7856's to make, not this file's.
 *
 * ## The scan surface — imported from `check:doc-types`, never re-declared
 *
 * objectui#7878. This census landed (PR objectui#7868) pointed at `content/docs`
 * alone while its two sibling doc gates had already been widened, by
 * objectui#6600 and objectui#7115, onto the per-app docs trees and the root
 * pages. That is the objectui#7115 geometry rebuilt one gate over: the root
 * `README.md` fell BETWEEN two gates' surfaces and taught an unregistered type
 * four times for as long as the example existed, for exactly one reason —
 * nothing read the file.
 *
 * So the surface is not re-declared here. `APP_DOCS`, `appDocsDirs` and
 * `ROOT_PAGES` are IMPORTED from `check-doc-component-types.mjs`, which makes the
 * two walks the same object rather than two arrays a test hopes are equal. The
 * three gates that carry copies of these constants do so for a stated reason that
 * does not apply here — importing `check-doc-snippet-types.mjs` pulls in its
 * `import ts from 'typescript'` at load, and `check-doc-fence-languages`' whole
 * value is running with no install. `check-doc-component-types.mjs` imports
 * node built-ins and `invoked-as.mjs`, the same four this file already imports,
 * so the copy would buy nothing and cost a pin. (`regenerate-known-schema-types`
 * already imports that module for the same reason.)
 *
 * `DOCS_ROOT` is the one leg still spelled here, because that gate declares it
 * `const` rather than `export const`; `check-doc-expression-carriage.test.ts`
 * pins this file's copy against that file's source text.
 *
 * ⚠️ Widening a scan surface is the change that can be GREEN ABOUT NOTHING, so
 * the widening is measured rather than asserted: the test pins that every leg of
 * the walk actually reaches a file, and the census prints the file count beside
 * the surface it walked.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ A hit is a CANDIDATE, not a verdict — `type` is not one vocabulary
 *
 * `check-doc-component-types` measured this and wrote it down: across the corpus
 * there are at least SEVEN distinct vocabularies that all spell the key `type` —
 * SDUI component keys, action schemas, block schemas, theme and report schemas,
 * field and JSON-Schema types, validation rules, nav and feed items. A node from
 * another vocabulary is judged here against a carriage map that does not govern
 * it, and can be reported while being perfectly correct. One of today's hits is
 * exactly that: `content/docs/api/schema-reference.md`'s `ActionSchema` example
 * authors a `${…}` on `condition`, which the ACTION runner's own gate evaluates,
 * not `SchemaRenderer`'s node channels.
 *
 * ⛔ The obvious fix — classify by the enclosing key path — was BUILT and
 * MEASURED by that gate before being rejected, because it does not converge:
 * `items` carries nav entries on one page and renderable children on another, so
 * any global parent-key rule is a silent false GREEN on one of them, and a
 * misclassifying discriminator is worse than none because its mistakes are
 * invisible in both directions. That ruling is inherited here rather than
 * re-litigated, and report-only is what makes inheriting it safe: a candidate a
 * human reads costs a minute, and nothing is blocked while the corpus is read.

/**
 * The JS OBJECT-LITERAL dialect, normalized to JSON — for the BLIND-SPOT
 * MEASUREMENT ONLY (objectui#8334). ⛔ Never on the judged path: `analyze` still
 * judges `fence.scanned` fences and nothing else, and this function is not
 * reachable from that branch.
 *
 * The blind-spot leg asks one question — *does this unscanned fence hold a typed
 * node?* — and before this existed it could only ask it of a body that survived
 * `JSON.parse`. A page authoring a real node tree the way JavaScript spells it
 * (unquoted keys, single-quoted strings) answered NOTHING, was counted in neither
 * the judged population nor the blind-spot list, and the summary then printed
 * `Dialect blind spot: none` over a class it could not see. That is the worst
 * shape a detector takes: full coverage reported precisely where there is none.
 *
 * Two REMOVALS of dialect, nothing else — like the four tolerances above, ⛔
 * neither can invent a key:
 *
 *   1. Single-quoted strings become double-quoted, with any interior `"`
 *      escaped. A quote character is re-spelled; no member is added or dropped.
 *   2. A bare identifier in a MEMBER position — immediately after `{` or `,` and
 *      followed by `:` — is quoted. The position is what makes it a key, which is
 *      the same predicate `dropElisionStrings` uses; an identifier anywhere else
 *      (a bare `string` in `type: string;`) is left alone and goes on failing to
 *      parse, which is how a TS `interface` body stays OUT of this measurement.
 *
 * The pass is comment-aware for the same reason `sanitizeFence` is: an
 * apostrophe inside `// don't` would otherwise open a string and corrupt the rest
 * of the body. Comments are dropped here rather than deferred, so the text handed
 * on is already free of them.

    What a hit means: \`SchemaRenderer\` evaluates exactly four channels — \`content\`,
    the carriage keys for the node's own type, the \`properties\` and \`props\` bags, and
    the condition keys. An expression written anywhere else reaches the renderer as the
    characters the author typed, so the page teaches a form that cannot work.

    \u26a0\ufe0f Read the passage before repairing: a hit is a CANDIDATE, not a verdict.
    \`type\` is at least seven vocabularies in these pages (measured by
    check-doc-component-types), and a node from another one — an ActionSchema, a field
    declaration, a nav item — is judged here against a carriage map that does not govern
    it. That gate built the obvious discriminator and rejected it as non-convergent; this
    one inherits the ruling, which is affordable precisely because it blocks nothing.

    Two repairs, chosen by what the passage teaches, never one blanket rule (the
    2026-09-01 ruling on objectui#7115, fork B — 「文档教现实」):
      - the passage is DEMONSTRATING binding  -> move it onto a channel that carries
        (a \`text\` node's \`content\` is evaluated on every type; or a real carriage key
        on the same node; or the \`properties\` bag);
      - the expression is incidental          -> author a literal, and say in prose which
        row is missing.
    ⛔ Adding a carriage row for the key is fork A and was rejected: that widens an
    authoring surface and is a maintainer decision, not a docs fix.

    Report-only: this gate does not fail the build on the findings above. Three cards of
    this class are open (objectui#7440, #7444, #7838) and each one fixes its own sites;
    see the header of scripts/check-doc-expression-carriage.mjs for why the census is the
    deliverable and what would justify flipping this to blocking.`);
