 * objectui#7210, half 2 — maintainer ruling a′ (2026-09-02), on the calendar.
 *
 * The calendar is the view where a cut is HARDEST to notice from the picture,
 * which is the ruling's whole concern. Its month grid draws at most four
 * events per day cell and a "+N more" affordance, so a month rendered from the
 * first N of a much larger set looks exactly like a full one — the missing
 * records are not missing pixels, they are cells that were never asked about.
 * There is no row count on screen to compare against, so the footnote is the
 * only signal that exists.
 *
 * ⚠️ Environment: jsdom, via this repo's `dom` vitest project. No assertion
 * here depends on container size or on a media query — the note is a sibling
 * in the component's own tree and is present or absent regardless of layout,
 * which is deliberate: `happy-dom` never fires container-size effects and
 * `jsdom` applies media-query rules irrespective of `innerWidth`, so a pin
 * that leaned on either would be unmeasurable rather than merely flaky.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — MEASURED on two separate ablations (objectui#7507),
 * because this file grades two different things and one of them was missing:
 *
 *   1. Remove `$top: NON_GRID_ROW_CEILING_TOP` from `ObjectCalendar`'s record
 *      fetch ⇒ red at the **`$top` assertion**, and there only; 1 failed /
 *      1 passed. NOT at the footnote, which is what this docblock used to
 *      predict. An adapter with no `$top` answers with the whole filtered set,
 *      `applyNonGridRowCeiling` slices it to the ceiling from the rows in
 *      hand, and both the event count and the note stay correct. Losing the
 *      `$top` is a bandwidth regression, not a correctness one.
 *   2. Hand the view the RAW response instead of the capped rows
 *      (`setData(capped.rows)` → `setData(result.data ?? capped.rows)`) ⇒ red
 *      at the **event-count assertion**, 2001 against 2000. Before #7507 that
 *      mutation left this file green at 4/4: `$top` was still sent and the
 *      footnote still rendered, while 2,001 events were drawn. That is the
 *      hole the count assertion below closes, and it is the ruling's own pin
 *      text — "the DOM row count equals the ceiling".
