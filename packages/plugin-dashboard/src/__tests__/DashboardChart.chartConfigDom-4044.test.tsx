 * objectui#4044 — END TO END on the INLINE dashboard chart relays: widget
 * metadata → real chart DOM.
 *
 * The sibling `DashboardChart.chartConfig-4044.test.tsx` pins WHICH keys the
 * two relays compose. That is necessary and not sufficient: the criterion for
 * lowering a `chartConfig` key is that the chart block DRAWS it, and a seam
 * assertion cannot tell a honoured prop from an ignored one — forwarding a prop
 * nobody reads would only move declared-but-not-delivered one layer down. So
 * this file renders the REAL chain with no renderer stub at all —
 * `DashboardRenderer` / `dashboard-grid` → `SchemaRenderer` → the registry's
 * `chart` (`ChartRenderer`) → `AdvancedChartImpl` — and reads the resulting DOM.
 *
 * Scope of this file: everything the chart draws OUTSIDE Recharts'
 * `ResponsiveContainer` — the ChartFrame titles, and the chart container's
 * height and accessible name. Recharts' own marks (bars, LabelList, reference
 * lines, Brush) need a measured box, which this file does not arrange, so they
 * are asserted — also on the dashboard surface, also end to end — in
 * `DashboardChart.chartConfigMarks-4044.test.tsx` beside this one, which sizes
 * the `ResponsiveContainer` element itself.
 *
 * ⚠️ This paragraph used to say the marks could only be pinned inside
 * `plugin-charts` (whose `ChartRenderer.dashboardChartConfig.test.tsx` mocks
 * `ResponsiveContainer`), because `recharts` resolves in that package alone.
 * The premise is still true — re-measured, `require.resolve('recharts')` from
 * `packages/plugin-dashboard` is MODULE_NOT_FOUND — but the CONCLUSION was
 * wrong, and wrong in the expensive direction: it left every plot-internal key
 * with no dashboard-surface pin at all, so the relays could stop forwarding
 * them and the only drawn evidence (in a file that hand-builds its own schema)
 * would stay green. A `recharts` mock is not the only way to give the plot a
 * box; see the sibling file for the one that needs no module mock.
 *
 * The widget below binds INLINE ROWS — deliberately not an ADR-0021 dataset,
 * which is the path `DatasetWidget.chartConfig.dom.test.tsx` already covers.
 * Both relays are exercised, because each composes its own chart node.
