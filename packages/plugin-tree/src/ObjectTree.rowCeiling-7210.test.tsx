 * objectui#7210, half 2 — maintainer ruling a′ (2026-09-02), on the tree.
 *
 * ⭐ This is the view the ceiling's VALUE was measured on, and the only one of
 * the four whose DOM grows with the result set: gantt virtualises, the
 * calendar month grid caps events per day cell, the map auto-clusters above
 * 100 markers — the tree flattens every expanded node into the document, at a
 * measured 5.2 elements per record. So the ruling's "the DOM row count equals
 * the ceiling" is literally checkable here, against real rendered `<tr>`s,
 * and this file checks it that way rather than through a stub.
 *
 * The truncation is also the most consequential here: a hierarchy assembled
 * from the first N rows is not a subtree of the real one — every node whose
 * parent fell past the cut is silently reparented to a root. Nothing in the
 * rendering says so, which is what the footnote is for.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — MEASURED, and corrected from what this docblock used
 * to predict (objectui#7507). Removing `$top: NON_GRID_ROW_CEILING_TOP` from
 * `ObjectTree`'s record fetch turns the truncation case red at the **`$top`
 * assertion** and there only, 1 failed / 1 passed; the below-ceiling case
 * stays green.
 *
 * ⚠️ The row count does NOT move, and the footnote does not disappear. The old
 * prediction — "the whole store arrives, nothing is capped, `truncated` is
 * false" — got the first clause right and drew the wrong conclusion from it.
 * The whole store does arrive; `applyNonGridRowCeiling` then slices it to the
 * ceiling and reports `truncated` from the rows in hand, so the rendered
 * `<tr>` count is still exactly 2,000 and the note still names both numbers.
 * Losing the `$top` is a BANDWIDTH regression here, not a correctness one, and
 * the `$top` assertion is the only thing in this file that sees it.

// than the `typeof import('@object-ui/plugin-detail')` its twelve siblings use.
// ⚠️ Not a style drift, and ⛔ do not "fix" it to match them: `plugin-tree` does
// NOT declare `@object-ui/plugin-detail`, and it has no reason to — measured,
// `ObjectTree`'s module graph reaches ZERO plugin-detail modules, where
// `ObjectGantt`'s and `ObjectCalendar`'s each reach 50. So this factory mocks a
// module nothing under test ever loads. A type-position `import()` of it is a
// real specifier to `check-phantom-dependencies`, which then (correctly) demands
// the package declare a dependency its runtime does not have. `<any>` inherits
// the surface without asserting an edge that isn't there.
