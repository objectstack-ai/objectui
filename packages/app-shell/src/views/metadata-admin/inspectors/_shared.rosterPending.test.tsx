/**
 * objectui#8862 — `InspectorSelectField` stops asserting "not offered" about a
 * roster that has not answered yet.
 *
 * objectui#8488 gave the primitive the rule "a stored value the roster does not
 * offer is drawn, and flagged". It decided "does not offer" by membership in an
 * `options` array — and that array cannot say WHY it is empty. An async picker
 * mid-round-trip hands over `[]`, byte-identical to a catalog that genuinely
 * does not carry the value, so a perfectly valid stored value wore the flag
 * until the response landed. On the metadata-authoring surface the flag is an
 * assertion about the author's own data, and the plausible response to it is to
 * "fix" a binding that was already right.
 *
 * ## ⭐ What makes this suite a pin and not a decoration
 *
 * The defect exists ONLY while the request is in flight. A case that renders a
 * populated roster and finds no marker proves nothing — it is green on the
 * defect and on the fix alike, because a populated roster never flagged
 * anything. So every case here holds the roster in the state the bug needs
 * (`options={[]}`, or short of the stored value) and reads the trigger in that
 * frame. `settles from pending to flagged` walks the two frames in one mount,
 * which is the shape the author actually sees.
 *
 * ## The true-negative leg is not optional
 *
 * An implementation that simply deleted the flag passes every "no marker" case
 * ever written. `keeps flagging …` and the second half of `settles …` are what
 * fail on it: with the roster ANSWERED and the value genuinely absent, the flag
 * must still be there. Both legs, or the suite is asserting "never flag".
 *
 * ## Why it reads the TRIGGER
 *
 * Same reason as `_shared.unknownValue.test.tsx`: the value the primitive is
 * handed is correct in every one of these frames, and the defect was entirely
 * in what reached pixels. Radix keeps the roster in a portal until the select
 * is opened, so text can only arrive on the trigger by way of a mounted
 * `SelectItem` that the controlled value MATCHED — which is also the evidence
 * that the pending row stays re-pickable rather than becoming a painted string.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification
 *
 * Ablating the read — restoring `label: unknownValueLabel(current)`
 * unconditionally, i.e. the pre-fix source — turns the pending-arm rows red and
 * leaves the answered-arm rows green. Run recorded on the PR.
