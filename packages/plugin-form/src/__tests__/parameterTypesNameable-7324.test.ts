/**
 * objectui#7324 — the parameter types of this package's published functions
 * are themselves published, so a consumer can NAME what it must pass.
 *
 * ## What went wrong, and why one `export` line would have made it worse
 *
 * Two DIFFERENT shapes carried the SAME name `ObjectSchemaLike` in two files
 * of this package, and neither reached the entry:
 *
 *   - `deriveMasterDetail.ts` — `{ name?, fields?: Record<string, any> }`, the
 *     `childSchema` of five functions the entry exports;
 *   - `schemaDefaults.ts` — `{ fields?: Record<string, {defaultValue?, type?,
 *     reference?} | undefined> }`, the `objectSchema` of
 *     `omitServerResolvedDefaults`, which the entry also exports.
 *
 * Re-exporting either under the shared name would have put a name on the
 * package's public surface that already meant something else two files over,
 * with nothing in the name to say which. So each was renamed at its
 * declaration site first: `ChildObjectSchemaLike` and
 * `FieldDefaultsSchemaLike`.
 *
 * ## Why the type-level half is the load-bearing half
 *
 * These are types. `import * as entry` cannot see them at runtime, so "the
 * name is importable" is only assertable by ANNOTATING with it and letting
 * `tsc` judge — this file is compiled by the package's `type-check`
 * (`tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`), which is where the pin actually bites. The
 * runtime `describe` below carries the one fact that IS runtime-visible and is
 * the thing a "widens the public surface" card must not get wrong: a
 * type-only export adds no runtime name.
 *
 * ## The controls
 *
 * `ChildObjectSchemaLike` and `FieldDefaultsSchemaLike` are MUTUALLY
 * ASSIGNABLE as written — measured, `tsc` accepts both directions — but only
 * because the child one's field values are `any`. So assignability cannot tell
 * them apart, and a control built on it would pass no matter which of the two
 * were exported under either name. The controls below are built on the two
 * facts `any` does not erase: the member SETS differ (`name` exists on one
 * only), and one's field value is `any` where the other's is pinned to four
 * members. Export the wrong declaration under either name and
 * `WRONG_ONE_EXPORTED_CONTROL` stops type-checking.
