 * InlineEditContext — record-level inline-edit session shared across the
 * `record:*` renderers of a record page (objectui#2407 P1). Lifting the
 * edit session out of `DetailView`'s private state lets the details body and
 * (P2) the highlights strip share ONE draft + ONE atomic Save.
 *
 * This is a *separate* context from `RecordContext` (mirrors
 * `HighlightFieldsContext`) on purpose: the draft mutates on every keystroke,
 * and routing that churn through `RecordContext` would re-render every
 * `record:*` consumer. Consumers that don't edit stay subscribed only to
 * `RecordContext` and never re-render on draft changes.
 *
 * The context holds PURE UI state — it knows nothing about the DataSource,
 * OCC, or how a draft is persisted. The atomic save + conflict handling live
 * in `<InlineEditSaveBar>` (@object-ui/plugin-detail), which reads this
 * context for the draft/editing flags and drives `saving`/`error`/`reset`.
