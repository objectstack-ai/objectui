/**
 * `content/docs/guide/layout.md`'s AppShell material teaches only real props
 * (objectui#4827).
 *
 * This is the same phantom-key fact as objectui#4817 (`packages/layout/README.md`,
 * pinned by `readme-app-shell-example.test.ts`) and objectui#4808
 * (`content/docs/layout/app-shell.mdx`, pinned by `app-shell-docs-nav-example.test.ts`),
 * on a THIRD teaching surface — and this one was the worst of the three, because
 * its carrier was JSON.
 *
 * The page's `### Schema API` block declared ten keys for a
 * `{ "type": "app-shell" }` node, of which `AppShellProps` has ever declared
 * two: `header`, `body`, `sidebarCollapsible`, `sidebarDefaultOpen`,
 * `headerClassName`, `sidebarClassName` and `contentClassName` do not exist,
 * and four of them were demonstrated a second time in the `### Custom Classes`
 * example. On the React surfaces a copied phantom prop at least reaches a
 * TypeScript consumer as an error; in a JSON document nothing checked it —
 * `app-shell` was registered with no `inputs` (`packages/layout/src/index.ts`),
 * so `sdui-parser`'s unknown-prop check had nothing to compare a node against
 * and reported nothing at all.
 *
 * That registration is GONE (objectui#4841, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove, remove
 * side). The key resolves to nothing now, so the node is refused by name instead
 * of silently under-rendering — `app-shell-not-a-component-key.test.tsx` owns
 * that fact and measures the diagnostic. This file is unchanged in what it
 * judges: the page's React material, and that no fence on it authors the node.
 *
 * ## What the page says now, and what the halves below hold to it
 *
 * The page was rewritten to teach `AppShell` as what it is — a React component
 * whose four node slots (`sidebar` / `navbar` / `children` / `rightRail`) a JSON
 * document cannot fill. Those claims were measured against this tree, not
 * inferred, and they are what objectui#4841 then acted on — the three bullets
 * below describe the registration as it behaved BEFORE it was removed:
 *
 *   - `className`, `defaultOpen` and `branding` DO survive the JSON path. They
 *     are plain data, `SchemaRenderer` spreads them onto the component, and a
 *     rendered `{ "type": "app-shell", "branding": {…} }` node really did set
 *     `document.title` and `--primary`.
 *   - `children` does NOT. `SchemaRenderer` strips `children` (and `body`) out
 *     of a node before spreading the rest as props, and `AppShell` reads its
 *     `children` PROP, never `schema.children`. The `<main>` element rendered
 *     empty with zero console output — the silent half of this issue.
 *   - `sidebar` / `navbar` / `rightRail` do NOT. A JSON value arrives as a plain
 *     object, and `AppShell` renders it directly, so React throws and the node
 *     is replaced by the renderer's error box (`Objects are not valid as a React
 *     child`). Loud, but still not the UI the page promised.
 *
 * 1. **Compile-time.** The prop objects below are real `AppShellProps` values
 *    imported from `../AppShell`, mirroring the four `<AppShell …>` examples the
 *    page now shows. `packages/layout`'s `type-check` script compiles this file
 *    (`tsconfig.test.json`), so re-adding `header` — or `headerClassName` —
 *    makes them stop compiling (TS2353) instead of silently rendering nothing.
 *
 * 2. **Props-table parity.** The `### Props` table is a hand-written copy of the
 *    interface and rots the same way the `Schema API` block did, so its rows are
 *    not hand-listed here either: props, order, optionality and type text are
 *    read OUT OF `AppShell.tsx` on every run. Inventing a key, dropping one, or
 *    adding one to the interface and not the table is red.
 *
 * 3. **Whole-page tag scan.** Parity guards the table and the compile-time half
 *    guards the objects it declares; a NEW `<AppShell>` example pasted in later
 *    would be guarded by neither. So every fence on the page is re-read, the
 *    props of each `<AppShell …>` opening tag collected, and any the interface
 *    does not declare rejected — again with the expected key list read out of
 *    source, so this can never rot into "update the test".
 *
 * 4. **No JSON `app-shell` node.** The four `React.ReactNode` slots are the
 *    whole point of an app shell, and none of them can be written in JSON, so a
 *    `{ "type": "app-shell" }` node on this page is the defect itself and not
 *    merely a stale spelling of it. The fences are checked for that node shape.
 *
 * 5. **The two source facts the page's prose rests on**, so the prose cannot go
 *    stale silently: `AppShell` still destructures a fixed key list with no rest
 *    element (which is why an undeclared prop vanishes without a warning), and
 *    `SchemaRenderer` still strips `children`/`body` before spreading a node's
 *    keys as props (which is why the `<main>` element comes out empty).
 *
 * ## Scan surface — deliberately narrow
 *
 * This file judges `content/docs/guide/layout.md`'s APP-SHELL material only: the
 * `### Props` table, the `<AppShell …>` opening tags in its fences, and whether
 * any fence authors an `app-shell` JSON node. The same page's `page`,
 * `page-header` and `sidebar-nav` sections are NOT audited here and must not be
 * swept in — `page` in particular declares `headerClassName` / `bodyClassName`
 * for a different component (`PageRenderer` in `@object-ui/components`), so a
 * file-wide ban on those spellings would be wrong. `packages/layout/README.md`
 * belongs to `readme-app-shell-example.test.ts` (objectui#4817) and
 * `content/docs/layout/app-shell.mdx` to `app-shell-docs-nav-example.test.ts`
 * (objectui#4793 / #4808); pinning the whole docs tree to source is
 * objectui#3786's problem, not this one.
 *
 * Note also that `@object-ui/app-shell` exports a DIFFERENT `AppShellProps`
 * (`packages/app-shell/src/types.ts`) which really does declare `header` — that
 * is a separate component, and reading this one's key list off this one's source
 * is what keeps the two from being conflated again.
