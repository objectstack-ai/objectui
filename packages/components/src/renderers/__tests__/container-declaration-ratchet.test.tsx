/**
 * THE UNIVERSAL container-declaration census, ratcheted to zero (objectui#6779).
 *
 * ## Why a THIRD file on this fact, and what makes it different
 *
 * The same defect has now been found three times independently, one registration
 * at a time: objectui#3900 (`page-header`, closed), objectui#6740 (`flex`,
 * PR #6762) and objectui#6764 (8 more, PR #6774). Each was filed as a one-off
 * because nothing in the tree asked the question of the tree.
 *
 * Its two existing pins are ENUMERATIVE, and that is precisely how the class
 * regenerated past them:
 *
 *   - `__tests__/layout-containers-declare-containment.test.tsx` covers a literal
 *     4-element array (`flex`/`grid`/`card`/`container`);
 *   - `renderers/__tests__/container-declaration-census.test.tsx` covers the 8
 *     that PR #6774 declared.
 *
 * Both stay: they pin WHY those twelve were declared, which this file does not.
 * What this file adds is the coverage set — the WHOLE REGISTRY instead of a
 * literal array — so the 4th rediscovery is a red test rather than a card.
 *
 * ## The instrument, and why it is a RUNTIME one
 *
 * objectui#6779 measured four reasons the source-side spelling of this question
 * cannot be built (option D, refused by name in the ruling):
 *
 *   1. `scripts/component-registrations.mjs`, the tree's own reader, refuses
 *      computed keys by design — and 41 of the 53 register from a loop variable,
 *      so it cannot even NAME them;
 *   2. file granularity mis-reads `layout/page.tsx` as compliant: it holds two
 *      `isContainer` tokens, both in a manifest-builder helper, while all five of
 *      its registrations lack the flag;
 *   3. WHICH registration is live is a whole-program import-order fact, with two
 *      recorded casualties in this tree (`ui:kbd`, `ui:table` — objectui#5125);
 *   4. "children or body" is not a distinction a source predicate keeps — that
 *      spelling over-reports by 10.
 *
 * So the predicate here is behavioural and executed: render the tag through the
 * real `SchemaRenderer` with one authored child and ask whether that child
 * reached the DOM. It is objectui#6740's mechanism with the array taken out.
 *
 * ⭐ THE EXCEPTION SHAPES NEED NO EXCLUSION LIST — the predicate excludes them.
 * The ruling names three populations a naive predicate would sweep in wrongly:
 * `tabs` (renders `items[].content`), the void tags `img`/`hr`/`br` (same loop
 * factory as 34 tags that DO render children), and the `schema.body` readers
 * (`badge`, `alert`, the `sidebar-*` family). Measured here: every one of them
 * puts NO authored child on the page, so the runtime predicate scores them as
 * non-containers by construction, with nothing skipped by name. That is a
 * property of this predicate and not of the population, so it is PINNED below —
 * rewrite the predicate as "renders children OR body" and those pins go red
 * instead of 10-plus tags silently becoming containers.
 *
 * ## MEASURED on main@d06059f24, over the live registry
 *
 *   - 293 registry keys, of which 131 are bare authoring tags;
 *   - 58 render `schema.children` (the child text reached the DOM);
 *   - 13 of those declare the flag: objectui#6764's 5-tag control set
 *     (`flex`/`grid`/`card`/`container`/`stack`) plus PR #6774's 8;
 *   - 45 do NOT, and every one drew `not-a-container` on a list it then rendered;
 *   - 73 render no children and correctly keep the diagnostic;
 *   - 0 failed to render, so nothing was scored on an exception.
 *
 * The 45 are the stock. `button` is excluded by ruling and pinned separately — that
 * exclusion was made PERMANENT and reasoned by objectui#6804 (2026-08-30); see the
 * `button` block below. The other 44 are `scripts/container-declaration-baseline.json`,
 * which is a RATCHET TO ZERO and not an exemption list: red when an unlisted tag
 * violates, and red again when a listed tag stops violating, so the file can only
 * shrink.

 * The repo root, derived from THIS FILE's own location — never from the cwd
 * (objectui#7799).
 *
 * TWO premises stood here and BOTH were false.
 *
 * 1. "The cwd is the repo root by construction: `scripts/
 *    vitest-invocation-guard.mjs` refuses any invocation whose vitest root is
 *    not the repo root." The guard is real, but it is a DIFFERENT invariant:
 *    `--root` moves VITEST's root and moves nothing about `process.cwd()`. This
 *    package's own `test` script — `vitest run --root ../.. packages/components/`,
 *    which is what `pnpm --filter @object-ui/components test` and
 *    `turbo run test` both run — sets that root correctly and leaves cwd at
 *    `packages/components/`. Measured with cwd as the only variable: 13 passed
 *    from the repo root, 6 failed / 7 passed from the package directory.
 * 2. "NOT `import.meta.url`: under vite that is an `http://` module URL, not a
 *    `file://` one." Measured on objectui#7799 in this very project (`dom`) and
 *    under both cwds, bare `import.meta.url` is
 *    `file:///…/packages/components/src/renderers/__tests__/<this file>`. What
 *    Vite rewrites is the TWO-ARGUMENT form `new URL(rel, import.meta.url)`,
 *    which does evaluate to a `http://localhost:3000/@fs/…` dev-server URL — so
 *    only the bare form is read below, and it is taken apart by hand rather than
 *    passed to `fileURLToPath`. That is the spelling landed for objectui#7791
 *    (PR #7796), copied here rather than invented again.
 *
 * The `globalThis` indirection went with the cwd read: this package's
 * `src/global.d.ts` declares a BROWSER `process` shim that its type-check
 * resolves ahead of the node global, so neither the bare `process` global nor
 * `import process from 'node:process'` compiles with `.cwd()`. Deriving the root
 * from `import.meta.url` reads no `process` at all, so the dance is simply gone.
 * That shim's own compile pin is not weakened by this: it lives in
 * `packages/components/src/__tests__/browser-process-shim-scope.test.ts`, which
 * still makes the `process.cwd()` call deliberately, for exactly that purpose.
