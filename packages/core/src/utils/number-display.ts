/**
 * `formatDisplayNumber` — the ONE number-display formatter behind every field
 * cell, field widget, metric renderer and dataset measure in the console.
 *
 * It exists because the same `new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', …)` construction
 * had been copied into the number cell renderer, the currency cell renderer,
 * the currency widget, the compact `formatNumber` helper and the dashboard
 * metric widget. Two defects therefore had five homes each, and fixing "the"
 * renderer never changed the answer (objectui#4033, source thread
 * objectstack#5067):
 *
 *  1. the locale was hardcoded to `en-US`, so a `zh-CN` / `de-DE` console still
 *     grouped and pointed decimals the US way; and
 *  2. `useGrouping` was never set, so a four-digit YEAR stored as
 *     `Field.number({ scale: 0 })` rendered as `2,026` — in every locale, with
 *     no field property able to turn it off.
 *
 * Both policies now live here and nowhere else. Call sites bring the value and
 * the display width; they do not bring a locale default and they do not decide
 * grouping.
 *
 * ── Why this module lives in `@object-ui/core` (objectui#4576) ──
 * It used to live in `@object-ui/i18n`, and that home cost the repo a real
 * defect. `@object-ui/core`'s `utils/dataset-format.ts` could not import it —
 * `core` is the React-free engine (AGENTS.md §3: "No UI-lib deps. Logic only.")
 * and is a runtime dependency of React-FREE consumers (the `object-ui` VS Code
 * extension, `@object-ui/data-objectstack`), while `i18n` depends on
 * `i18next`/`react-i18next` and peer-depends on React. So `formatMeasure` kept
 * a parallel `Intl` implementation, the two drifted, and a German session read
 * `1.234,5 %` from a list cell beside `1.234,5%` from a dashboard measure
 * (objectui#4576). #4577 measured the option mapping LOSSLESS across 32,760
 * combinations and recorded the duplication at both ends rather than routing
 * through a boundary it could not cross.
 *
 * The function is pure — no React, no i18next, no DOM — so the boundary was
 * never a property of the CODE, only of where the code sat. Moving it DOWN to
 * the lower layer removes the obstacle instead of working around it:
 * `@object-ui/i18n` now RE-EXPORTS these three names, so every existing import
 * path keeps compiling and `import { formatDisplayNumber } from '@object-ui/i18n'`
 * and `from '@object-ui/core'` are the SAME symbol (pinned in
 * `packages/i18n/src/__tests__/number-display.reexport-identity.test.ts`).
 * `core` imports `i18n` nowhere, so the new edge introduces no cycle.

  /**
   * BCP-47 tag for the ACTIVE display locale — in React, whatever
   * `useDisplayLocale()` returns.
   *
   * `undefined` means "follow the runtime default", which is the honest answer
   * for a non-React caller that has no locale in hand. It never means `en-US`:
   * assuming US conventions for the whole world is the defect this module was
   * created to remove.
   *
   * ── The caller this rule governs (objectui#10098) ──
   * The `undefined` rule above is written for a NON-REACT display caller with
   * no tag in hand: a plain formatter, an exporter, engine code — anything that
   * cannot call a hook. For that caller the runtime default is the viewer's
   * own environment, and the viewer's own environment is the honest locale for
   * a user-facing display. A malformed tag ends in the same place, whoever the
   * caller: {@link formatDisplayNumber} retries without it rather than
   * throwing, so the number renders in the runtime default instead of taking
   * the cell down.
   *
   * A React renderer is governed by a different rule, and the two do not
   * contradict each other. It passes what `useDisplayLocale` returns, and that
   * hook — `@object-ui/i18n`, `packages/i18n/src/useDisplayLocale.ts` — ends
   * its provider chain on the concrete `'en'`, for determinism, when the chain
   * yields no tag at all. That hook's docblock names this one in return.

   * The FIELD's declared `scale` — the `s` of a `decimal(p, s)` column — and

   * when a field declaration actually said so.
   *
   * `scale: 0` with no currency declares a discrete integer (a year, a fiscal
   * period, an ordinal), and those are not grouped. Leave `scale` undefined and
   * grouping is kept — which is correct for the two cases that look similar but
   * are not:
   *
   *   - an UNDECLARED scale (`scale` is optional in the spec, so absent means
   *     "decimals unknown", not "integer"); and
   *   - a caller whose zero-decimal display comes from something other than a
   *     field declaration — e.g. the dashboard `MetricWidget`, whose decimals
   *     come from a numeral.js format pattern and whose large KPI aggregates
   *     are *documented* to want separators ("`1,930,000` not `1930000`").
   *
   * ⚠️ INTERIM DEFAULT (objectui#4033, PM ruling 2026-08-11). Suppressing
   * grouping for every scale-0 number is a transitional policy with a known,
   * accepted cost: a large scale-0 COUNT loses its separators too. It is the
   * better trade only until the spec gains an authorable presentation hint
   * (`useGrouping` / `displayFormat` — being specified separately, contract-first,
   * in the objectstack repo). When that hint lands it OVERRIDES this default,
   * and this heuristic should be reduced to the fallback for fields that
   * declare nothing.

  /**
   * How the number relates to a percentage — the ONE place that distinction is
   * expressed, because getting it wrong is the whole of objectui#4576.
   *
   *  - `'decimal'` (default) — a plain number, no percent sign.
   *  - `'percent'` — the value is a FRACTION. `Intl` multiplies it by 100 and
   *    appends the locale's percent convention, so `0.8` renders as `80%`.
   *  - `'percentPoints'` — the value is ALREADY in percentage points, so `80`
   *    renders as `80%`. Same locale convention, NO re-scaling.
   *
   * The third one exists because "divide by 100 so `Intl` can multiply it back"
   * is not free, and the round trip is lossy at rounding TIES: measured on this
   * repo's runner, `80.175` percentage points formatted to 2 decimals renders
   * `80.18%` when formatted directly and `80.17%` after the divide-and-remultiply
   * — 27,581 of 1,200,013 ordinary-magnitude en-US forms move, plus every
   * value at the top of the double range (`MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, `1e23`). That
   * count is objectui#4576's tie-dense grid — 0.005 steps to 2,000, precisions
   * 0/1/2 — measured on `formatDisplayNumber` / `formatMeasure`'s call shape.
   * objectui#4590 re-measured the same route through `formatPercent` and
   * reports 27,577 of 1,200,003: a different form set, not a correction of this
   * one. A caller holding percentage points must therefore NOT reach for
   * `'percent'`; that is exactly the trap this option removes.
   *
   * `'percentPoints'` is implemented with `Intl`'s `style: 'unit'` /
   * `unit: 'percent'`, which was measured to produce a BYTE-IDENTICAL percent
   * affix to `style: 'percent'` across all 171 locale tags tested — including
   * the German/French/Russian no-break space before the sign, Turkish's PREFIX
   * position (`%1.234,5`), Arabic's own percent sign plus U+061C, and the
   * Bengali/Marathi percent patterns that group Western-style where their
   * decimal patterns group by lakh. It is the same CONVENTION by a route that
   * does not touch the value.
