/**
 * objectui#8695 — `LookupCellRenderer` answered ONE epistemic state two
 * opposite ways, and which one you got was decided by the SHAPE of the string.
 *
 * ── Re-measured on this base, before anything was changed ─────────────────
 * The card's readings were taken at `da5e4f69e`; `packages/fields/src/index.tsx`
 * has since been released by objectui#9068. Both readings reproduce verbatim.
 * `getCellRenderer('lookup')`, `reference_to: 'sys_user'`, no data source, in
 * ONE render:
 *
 *   'Ada Lovelace'     → <span class="block max-w-full truncate"
 *                          title="Ada Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</span>
 *   'wo_1'             → <span class="block max-w-full truncate"
 *                          title="wo_1">wo_1</span>
 *   '01HQZX9K2M4N6P8R' → <span class="block max-w-full truncate
 *                          text-muted-foreground" title="—">—</span>
 *
 * The first two are BYTE-IDENTICAL to what a `text` cell prints for the same
 * string — the screen states a confident fact it does not have, so a dirty row
 * reads exactly like a clean one. The third destroys the raw id, which
 * objectui#8434's triage named as "the only clue for diagnosing existing dirty
 * rows". Two opposite failures, one state, chosen by `isLikelyOpaqueId`.
 *
 * ── ⭐ Why the pins below assert AGREEMENT ────────────────────────────────
 * A per-shape assertion ("the opaque one now shows its id") would go green on
 * a repair that made both shapes wrong in a NEW matching way. The disagreement
 * IS the finding, so the load-bearing assertion is that the three shapes get
 * the SAME treatment — their markup normalises to one string — with a floor
 * underneath it (the affordance is present, the raw value survives, and the
 * sentence is epistemic) so that "identically wrong" cannot pass either.
 *
 * ── ⭐ How many states hide behind "unresolved" — measured, not assumed ────
 * Six causes reach this arm and the renderer distinguishes NONE of them:
 * never fetched (no dataSource / no `reference_to`), IN FLIGHT, the resolver
 * threw, the resolver answered with no record, it answered with a record no
 * display field could name, and — for array entries after the first — never
 * asked at all (`primaryPrimitiveId`). `useLookupName` returns
 * `string | undefined`, dropping the `pending`/`err`/`ok` discriminator its own
 * cache holds. So the card's premise that this renderer "can genuinely
 * distinguish 'fetched and absent' from 'never fetched'" is false as the code
 * stands, and even surfacing the discriminator could not upgrade the sentence:
 * a throw and an empty answer also cover a record the VIEWER may not read, and
 * "cannot read" vs "does not exist" is an existence-oracle boundary this lane
 * does not cross (objectui#8631). ⇒ the sentence must stay EPISTEMIC, exactly
 * as objectui#8434 ruled, and `THE SENTENCE` below pins that.
 *
 * ── ⛔ What this file must not let pass ───────────────────────────────────
 * The controls are the other half: a genuinely RESOLVED reference must render
 * exactly as it does today, unmarked (three ways of resolving: an expanded
 * record, the author's `options`, and the fetch-on-demand resolver), and an
 * empty cell must keep `EmptyValue`. Without them a reviewer cannot tell this
 * repair from "every lookup now looks broken".
