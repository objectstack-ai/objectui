/**
 * Full key parity across all ten locale packs (objectui#2872 P3).
 *
 * This replaces the four-namespace ratchet added in objectui#2905. That one was
 * deliberately scoped because the eight non-Chinese packs were still ~277 keys
 * behind, and a full assertion would have been a permanently red build rather
 * than a guard. With the backfill complete, the scope restriction is gone and
 * the invariant is simply: **every pack defines every `en` key, and no pack
 * defines a key `en` lacks** — save one computed exception: the plural slot of
 * an `en` family for a CLDR category the pack's OWN language selects and `en`'s
 * does not (`ru` `_few`, `ar` `_two`, …; objectui#11432, the third section below).
 *
 * Why this needs a test at all: `fallbackLng: 'en'` makes both failure modes
 * invisible at runtime.
 *
 *   - A key missing from `de` renders English. That reads as "not translated
 *     yet", not "we lost this" — and the missing-key handler is dev-only, so CI
 *     never sees it.
 *   - A key added to one pack but never to `en` cannot be translated by anyone
 *     else and drifts silently. objectui#2872 part (b) was exactly this, 74 keys
 *     deep, hidden behind a component-private fallback that made English
 *     "happen to" render.
 *
 * The only permitted exception is the outbound-message set below.
 *
 * ## What this test does NOT own
 *
 * Key sets and placeholder shape, and nothing about what a value SAYS. Two
 * sibling gates split the rest, and the boundaries are load-bearing:
 *
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` (objectui#3530) — a key a `t()`
 *     call site asks for that NO pack defines. Ten packs identically missing it
 *     is full parity, so this file is green on it by construction.
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` (objectui#3650) — when an `en` VALUE
 *     changes, the nine translations must change in the same PR. This file was
 *     green through objectui#3582 and objectui#3625, correctly: neither touched
 *     a key set or a placeholder. Trying to make it red on those would be asking
 *     a key-set test to judge meaning.
 *
 * That gate skips any key a pack does not define — including the four
 * `OUTBOUND_KEYS` below — precisely because their key sets are this file's
 * business, so the two cannot contradict each other on the same fact.
 *
 * ## The second invariant here: a plural family carries a base key (objectui#3863)
 *
 * Parity across packs is necessary and NOT sufficient, and `detail.showEmptyRelated`
 * was the proof: ten packs, identical key sets, `_one` and `_other` in every one of
 * them — full parity, green — and `ru` still rendered ENGLISH at counts 2-20 and `ar`
 * at 2-99. The mechanism is one level below key sets. i18next asks
 * `Intl.PluralRules` for the ONE suffix a language needs for that number and, when
 * the pack has no such slot, walks `fallbackLng` to `en`. `ru` has four categories
 * (`one/few/many/other`) and `ar` six (`+ zero/two`); no pack in this repo defines
 * `_few`/`_many`/`_two`/`_zero`, so those categories resolved nothing locally.
 *
 * The BASE key (no suffix) was the fix that composed with strict parity then: it is
 * always in i18next's lookup chain, so every category a pack did not enumerate
 * landed on it, in the pack's own language. It kept `ru` and `ar` out of English but
 * not in grammar — one string cannot agree with every count, so `ru` read
 * "Сброс через 3 часов" where Russian needs "часа" (objectui#11432). The third
 * section below therefore requires the explicit slot; the base key stays, for a
 * call made without a count.
 *
 * So this file owns the rule "a plural family must carry a base key" for a measured
 * reason rather than by convenience — the two candidate homes were compared:
 *
 *   - `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` reads exactly ONE pack
 *     (`collectEnKeys`, `packages/i18n/src/locales/en.ts`). Slot coverage is a
 *     per-pack fact about `ru` and `ar`; an `en`-only instrument cannot state it, and
 *     it only sees families reached from a statically parsable `t()` literal — a
 *     family added to the packs before its call site lands (the objectui#3546
 *     transition, which ran for months) would be invisible. Tightening its
 *     `resolvesLeaf` would also make it report a complete-but-baseless family as
 *     `missing-key`, whose remediation text reads "The key exists in no locale pack" —
 *     false for a family nine packs define.
 *   - Here, the rule is pack-intrinsic: it walks all ten packs' own key sets, needs no
 *     call site to exist, and fails in `pnpm test` at PR time.
 *
 * ## The third invariant: every family carries every category its language selects (objectui#11432)
 *
 * For each pack, the expected slot set of a plural family is COMPUTED, never listed:
 * `Intl.PluralRules(<pack code>).resolvedOptions().pluralCategories` — the same
 * resolver i18next asks — mapped to `_<category>`. Every one of those slots must be a
 * real, non-empty leaf of that pack. A base key standing in for a category does not
 * count; the explicit suffix is required, because a count-invariant string is the
 * only thing a base can hold and the language has a form for that number.
 *
 * What a "family" is, here and in the base-key rule above: any leaf whose name ends
 * in one of i18next's six CLDR suffixes makes its stem a family — exactly how
 * i18next reads the pack, so the rule cannot miss a family by its spelling, and it
 * needs no call site. Families are taken as the union over `en` and the pack, so a
 * new pack or a new family that misses a category goes red here at PR time.
 *
 * ⛔ Out of this rule's reach, by construction: a count label selected IN CODE
 * (`xxxCount` / `xxxCountOne`, `xxxCountPlural`) — the component, not i18next,
 * picks the key, so the pack has no category slot to judge. Those are pinned per key
 * where they were repaired (`searchItemsAvailable-plural-9664.test.ts`, and
 * `countLabels.ruAr-10242.test.tsx` in `@object-ui/app-shell`).
 *
 * The rendering half — that i18next really selects each slot written here, through a
 * real instance over the shipped packs — is `plural-categories-11432.test.ts`.
