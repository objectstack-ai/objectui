/**
 * Renders the "Changeset Claim Re-read" pull request comment body for
 * `.github/workflows/changeset-presence.yml`.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-changeset-claims.mjs --json claims.json
 *       node scripts/render-changeset-claims-comment.mjs --from claims.json
 *
 * ## Why this exists (objectui#9140)
 *
 * `check-changeset-claims.mjs` calls its finding a REQUEST TO READ, addressed to
 * the seat whose own diff might have falsified a pending changeset's prose.
 * objectui#9140 measured that request at ZERO answers out of four live
 * instances, and the reason is where it was addressed: a job log nobody opens on
 * a green check. The director's ruling (maintainer 「同意」) is that the finding
 * is DELIVERED — posted onto the pull request — and that everything else about
 * the gate stays exactly as it was: exit 0, not a required context, nothing
 * blocks.
 *
 * ## Why this is a file and not an inline `script:` block
 *
 * Same reason `render-budget-comment.mjs` is one: logic embedded in YAML cannot
 * be tested, and the bug class this rendering can carry is not hypothetical —
 * the budget comment once rendered an ABSENT measurement as a FAIL verdict
 * (objectui#3152). Here the equivalent mistake is rendering "no findings" as a
 * request to re-read, which would teach readers to skim exactly the comment the
 * ruling exists to get read. `scripts/__tests__/render-changeset-claims-comment.test.ts`
 * covers both directions.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The marker is PLAIN TEXT, and that is load-bearing
 *
 * "One comment per pull request, updated in place rather than stacked" needs the
 * job to find its own previous comment. The usual shape for that is a hidden
 * HTML-comment marker — and in THIS repository that shape does not work.
 * AGENTS.md records it as measured, under the six ways GitHub rewrites the bytes
 * of a body you post: tag-shaped fragments are deleted on save, backticks and
 * fenced code blocks do NOT protect them, and「单独占据第一行的 HTML 注释标记
 * 同样被吃掉」— an HTML-comment marker alone on the first line is eaten too, so a
 * mechanism that scans for its marker cannot see its own comment at all.
 *
 * A marker that vanishes does not degrade the feature gracefully: every re-run
 * fails to find the previous comment and posts a new one, which is the stacking
 * the ruling forbids, delivered as a growing wall on somebody else's pull
 * request.
 *
 * So the marker is the first line of the body, in plain text, and it renders
 * visibly. Visible is the price; it is the same convention the `os-dev-report`
 * comments in this organisation use, and for the same measured reason.
 *
 * ⛔ The workflow does NOT carry a second copy of the marker: it reads the first
 * line of the body it is about to post and looks for comments opening with that
 * line. Two spellings of one marker is the drift this avoids.
 *
 * ## Quoted prose is repaired for the same sanitizer, on the way out
 *
 * The body quotes a PARAGRAPH of somebody else's changeset (objectui#8617 — the
 * paragraph is the unit that rots). That prose is not written for this channel
 * and routinely names React components in angle brackets, which is exactly the
 * tag-shaped fragment GitHub deletes on save. AGENTS.md records the damage:
 * a before/after table lost the generic parameters in both of its columns and
 * rendered as though nothing had changed.
 *
 * Silently losing the identifier a paragraph is ABOUT is worse than showing the
 * reader a repair, so `spellOutTags` rewrites those spans visibly and says what
 * it did. ⛔ It is not a general escape: it touches quoted prose only, and the
 * transformation is stated in the comment so no reader mistakes it for what the
 * changeset says.
