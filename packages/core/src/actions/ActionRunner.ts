  // but INFERS to the object form alone. This runner consumes authored/stored
  // rows, which #3903 established are rehydrated UNPARSED, so it sees the input
  // shape. Deriving from the `z.infer` side would type-error the raw-string
  // predicate that `ActionEngine` explicitly supports and that
  // `ActionEngine.visibility.test.ts` pins.
  //
  // WHICH SPEC NAME carries `z.input` changed under us in `@objectstack/spec`
  // 17.0.0-rc.6: up to rc.5 it was `ActionInput` (with `Action` = `z.infer`),
  // and rc.6 retired every `…Input` alias and moved the bare name onto the input
  // side (`Action` = `z.input`, `ActionParsed` = `z.infer`). The import above is
  // therefore `Action as SpecActionInput` — the local alias keeps naming the
  // side this file needs, so every derivation below is unchanged in meaning.
  //
  // `shortcut` and `bulkEnabled` land here as `undefined`, not as a usable type
  // — that is correct and deliberate. Spec 17 retired both as `retiredKey()`
  // tombstones (`z.never()`), so authoring either is a hard parse rejection.
  // Deriving rather than hand-writing turns that rejection into a COMPILE error
  // for free; hand-copying would have re-legitimized two dead keys.

/*
 * ## The two predicate gates in `execute`, and the one question they ask first
 *
 * `execute` gates on `condition` and on `disabled`, and both need ONE question
 * answered before evaluating — "is a gate DECLARED here, i.e. is there a
 * condition to reach a verdict on?" — for OPPOSITE reasons, which is exactly why
 * the question has to be asked separately from the verdict:
 *
 *   - `disabled` (objectui#3848): an EMPTY predicate must not be handed to
 *     `evaluateCondition`, whose answer for "no condition" is `true` = BLOCKED.
 *     Measured consequence of asking `!= null && !== false` instead:
 *     `disabled: ''` returned `{ success: false, error: 'Action is disabled' }`
 *     and the handler never ran.
 *   - `condition` (objectui#3872): a DECLARED-FALSE predicate must not be
 *     skipped by a truthiness test. `if (action.condition)` never asked whether
 *     a gate was declared, so `condition: false` — the most explicit "never
 *     execute" an author can write — landed on `if (false)`, the evaluator was
 *     never consulted, and the action RAN. Measured on `origin/main` @
 *     `2937bcf7d`: `condition: false` → `{"success":true}`, handler ran, while
 *     the semantically identical `{ dialect: 'cel', source: 'false' }` was
 *     refused. Asking "declared?" routes `false` to `evaluateCondition`, which
 *     short-circuits booleans (`if (typeof condition === 'boolean') return
 *     condition`) and blocks.
 *
 * Both read {@link hasDeclaredPredicate} — the repo's one definition of that
 * question, in `evaluator/declaredPredicate.ts` beside the normalizer it is
 * derived from, with the scope objectui#3850 ruled on (`''` / whitespace-only /
 * empty-`source` envelope / non-predicate junk are NOT declared; a declared
 * `false` IS). This gate arrived here first as a module-private helper with a
 * scope note saying it stayed private until that ruling landed; it has, so the
 * definition moved down a layer and the renderer side reads the same one
 * (`components/renderers/action/visibility-gate.ts` re-exports it as
 * `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate`, `SchemaRenderer`'s `disabled` chain calls it).
 *
 * ## Why the gates normalize to DECIDE but evaluate the RAW value
 *
 * Historically the two were not interchangeable for a string already spelled as
 * a `${…}` template: `toPredicateInput` assumed a bare expression and wrapped
 * unconditionally, so `'${x}'` became `'${${x}}'`, which no longer matched the
 * single-template fast path and did not parse — leaving a constant verdict whose
 * direction was set by the caller's error policy (fail-soft got the unparsed
 * string back, `Boolean(…)` = `true`; fail-closed got a throw). On `disabled`
 * that meant "always blocked", on `condition` the opposite ("always execute").
 * That defect was objectui#3871, fixed at the normalizer: an already-`${…}`
 * string is returned untouched, the normalizer is idempotent, and
 * `evaluateCondition(toPredicateInput(raw))` agrees with
 * `evaluateCondition(raw)` on every shape these gates accept.
 *
 * The gates still read the raw value. Nothing forces the change now that the two
 * agree, and it would be churn on the execution path rather than a fix — but the
 * reason has shifted from "must" to "no reason to", so the equality is pinned
 * next to each gate's suite (`ActionRunner.disabledGate.test.ts` /
 * `ActionRunner.conditionGate.test.ts`, the two cases that replaced the
 * objectui#3871 tripwires) instead of being assumed. Every non-empty shape —
 * boolean, bare CEL, `${…}` template, `{ dialect, source }` envelope — keeps the
 * verdict it reaches today.
 *
 * The `visible`-filter template in `ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation` used to
 * be the one place this scope was NOT shared: its non-predicate branch kept a
 * historical `Boolean(raw)` coercion, so `0` there meant "hidden" — fail-CLOSED
 * on junk, the opposite of what this module committed to for `disabled`
 * (`catch { isDisabled = false }`). That filter now reads
 * {@link hasDeclaredPredicate} too (objectui#3957), so a value that is not a
 * predicate at all decides nothing on either key, at either entry: `0` / `{}` are
 * "no gate" here, in the engine filter, and in the shared definition.

   * ## An id never travels without its object (objectui#4292)
   *
   * `?recordId=` names an id and nothing else, so the consumer has to pick an
   * object to resolve it against, and the only one it can pick is the FormView's
   * own target object (`/forms/:name` does exactly that since objectui#4278).
   * That is right whenever the action fired from a record OF that object, and
   * nothing here used to check that it did: `target: 'showcase_task.edit'` on an
   * Account record header is publishable metadata, and with per-table integer
   * keys `GET /data/showcase_task/42` cheerfully answers for Account 42. Before
   * #4278 the damage stopped at a duplicate insert; now that the route honours
   * the param, the same mis-scoped action PATCHes a different object's record
   * with no error anywhere. So the id is forwarded only when the two objects
   * MATCH, and the object identity rides along as the consumer's second half of
   * the check ({@link FORM_RECORD_OBJECT_PARAM}).
   *
   * The three outcomes, and why the third preserves rather than refuses:
   *
   *  - **match** — forward `?recordId=&recordObject=`. The #4278 edit path,
   *    plus the identity the consumer re-checks against its own view metadata;
   *  - **mismatch** — forward NEITHER, i.e. the bare `/forms/:name`. A "log
   *    time" action fired from a Task at another object's create view is not a
   *    broken edit, it is a CREATE that happens to be launched from a record —
   *    which is exactly what this route did before #4278 taught it to read the
   *    param. Refusing here would break a shape that works;
   *  - **not comparable** — either end unknown ⇒ forward as before. A host that
   *    publishes no `objectName`, or an unqualified target name, gives this
   *    runner nothing to compare; tightening on absent information would turn
   *    working edit flows into creates on every such host. The guard only ever
   *    fires on information it actually has, and the consumer half applies the
   *    same rule to a missing `recordObject`.
