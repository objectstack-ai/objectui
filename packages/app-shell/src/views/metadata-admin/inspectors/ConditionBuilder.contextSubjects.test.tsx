/**
 * `ConditionBuilder`'s SUBJECT DROPDOWN may not offer a root the engine
 * refuses — objectui#9855, the second door of objectui#9645.
 *
 * ## The defect these cases reproduce
 *
 * objectui#9645 stopped the raw CEL editor's AUTOCOMPLETE from advertising
 * roots a mount's host does not bind. The row builder's subject dropdown was
 * not part of that ruling and kept its own default list, so `org.id` stayed
 * one click away at every mount that declares no vocabulary.
 *
 * `org` was strictly worse than the roots objectui#9645 withdrew, and the two
 * failures are not the same failure:
 *
 *  - an over-advertised root there linted CLEAN and failed at runtime;
 *  - `org` is not in `@objectstack/formula`'s `SCOPE_ROOTS` at all, so the
 *    record-scope validator reads `org.id` as a bare field and REJECTS it
 *    outright, with a remedy naming a record field that does not exist.
 *
 * That is the `app` case `ROW_PREDICATE_ROOTS` (`ConditionalFormattingEditor`)
 * settled under objectui#8155 — an editor advertising a root its own linter
 * rejects — reached through a different control.
 *
 * ## Real engine, on purpose
 *
 * Like `ConditionBuilder.mountRoots.test.tsx` and
 * `ConditionBuilder.mountScope.test.tsx`: the question under test is what the
 * ENGINE says about a subject this component OFFERS. A stub would let the
 * suite stay green while the dropdown went on offering the unofferable — which
 * is precisely how `org.id` survived objectui#6296 and objectui#9645.
 *
 * ## The pins are DERIVED, not retyped
 *
 * The default vocabulary is read off the rendered dropdown and each subject's
 * root is put to the real validator, so this file never restates the engine's
 * answer (AGENTS.md #9). It fails when either side moves: a subject added to
 * the default list that the engine refuses, and equally an engine that starts
 * refusing one the list still offers.
 *
 * ## The must-not-break half
 *
 * `user.*` is deliberately STILL offered, and a case below holds it there.
 * objectui#9855 proposed removing it too; the engine ACCEPTS it and
 * `buildExpressionScope` binds it for every predicate evaluated in the
 * browser, so withdrawing it by default would take a legitimate subject away
 * from the client-evaluated mounts. Narrowing it belongs to the
 * server-evaluated mounts as a DECLARED vocabulary — see the note on
 * `CONTEXT_SUBJECTS`. An over-narrowing reddens here rather than shipping.
