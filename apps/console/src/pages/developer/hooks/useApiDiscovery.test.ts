/**
 * useApiDiscovery — service-gated endpoint groups (#4240, #5286, #5291).
 *
 * ## The defect #4240 pinned, and where #9683 left it
 *
 * `SERVICE_ENDPOINT_CATALOG` keys are looked up in `/discovery`'s `services`
 * map, which the framework keys by `CoreServiceName`. #4240 fixed a mis-key
 * (the storage group was keyed by its route while the slot was spelled
 * differently). A miss here is indistinguishable from "no such service" —
 * the deliberate fail-closed branch (ADR-0076 D12) then hides the group
 * everywhere, on every deployment, silently.
 *
 * The framework's #9683 ruling (2026-08-18) made `storage` the canonical
 * slot and kept `file-storage` as a deprecated v17 alias, which both
 * discovery producers fill with a byte-equal copy of the `storage` row.
 * #5286 bridged the two spellings on this side while the installed spec
 * enum still lacked `storage`; #5291 re-keyed the catalog to `storage` and
 * removed that bridge. The page now reads the canonical key and nothing
 * else — pinned below in both directions.
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and why the gate is left real
 *
 * `isServiceUsable` (`@object-ui/react`) is NOT stubbed here — it is the
 * contract under test on the "hidden" cases, and a transcription of it would
 * be free to agree with itself. Only `fetch` is stubbed. No adapter provider
 * is mounted, so `useAdapter()` returns `null` by design and the metadata /
 * data / schema endpoint families stay empty — that isolates these assertions
 * to the service-gated path without mocking any module.
 *
 * The last block is the tripwire the #4240 fix would have needed to be
 * caught: it derives the expected key vocabulary from the spec itself rather
 * than restating it, so a rename on EITHER side goes red instead of going
 * quiet.
