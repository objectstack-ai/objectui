title: "Schema Rendering"
---

Object UI's schema rendering system is the core mechanism that transforms JSON configurations into live React components. This guide explains how it works and how to use it effectively.

## Overview

The schema rendering engine follows a simple principle:

```
JSON Schema → SchemaRenderer → React Components → Beautiful UI
```

Every visual element in Object UI starts as a JSON object that describes what should be rendered, not how it should be rendered.

## The SchemaRenderer Component

The `SchemaRenderer` is the primary component that interprets your JSON schemas:

```tsx
import { SchemaRenderer } from '@object-ui/react'
import { initializeComponents } from '@object-ui/components'
import type { PageNodeSchema } from '@object-ui/types'
// Side-effect import: loading the package runs its own field registration.
import '@object-ui/fields'

// Register components once at app initialization
initializeComponents()

function App() {
  const schema: PageNodeSchema = {
    type: "page",
    title: "My Dashboard",
    body: [{ type: "text", content: "Hello" }]
  }
  
  return <SchemaRenderer schema={schema} />
}
```

## Schema Structure

Every schema object must have at minimum a `type` field:

```typescript
import type { CSSProperties } from 'react'

interface BaseSchema {
  type: string           // Component type identifier
  id?: string           // Optional unique identifier
  className?: string    // Tailwind CSS classes
  style?: CSSProperties // Inline styles (use sparingly)
  visibleOn?: string    // Expression for conditional visibility
  hiddenOn?: string     // Expression for conditional hiding
  disabledOn?: string   // Expression for conditional disabling
}
```

### Example Schema

```json
{
  "type": "card",
  "id": "stats-card",
  "className": "p-6 shadow-lg",
  "title": "User Statistics",
  "visibleOn": "${user.role === 'admin'}",
  "body": {
    "type": "text",
    "content": "Total Users: ${stats.totalUsers}"
  }
}
```

## Data Context

Expression context does not arrive as a prop. `SchemaRenderer` declares exactly one prop,
`schema`, and every other prop it is handed is forwarded to the component the schema names —
so a `data` prop written on the element reaches the evaluator through nothing. Because it is
forwarded rather than refused, nothing throws and nothing warns; the expression simply never
resolves. The scope comes from `PredicateScopeProvider`, which publishes each name you give
it as an expression root:

```tsx
import { SchemaRenderer, PredicateScopeProvider } from '@object-ui/react'
import type { BaseSchema } from '@object-ui/types'

// The page schema from the first example on this page.
declare const schema: BaseSchema

// Every name here becomes a root the schema's expressions can read.
const scope = {
  user: { name: 'John', role: 'admin' },
  stats: { totalUsers: 1234 },
}

function App() {
  return (
    <PredicateScopeProvider scope={scope}>
      <SchemaRenderer schema={schema} />
    </PredicateScopeProvider>
  )
}
```

An app built on `@object-ui/app-shell` does not mount this provider itself: the shell's
`ExpressionProvider` already feeds the same channel with `user` (the signed-in user, also
readable as `current_user`) and `features`.

The scope the evaluator builds is what you published, plus three names the renderer supplies:

| name | what it holds |
|---|---|
| every key of `scope` | exactly what you put there — `stats`, `current_user`, whatever the page needs |
| `page` | page-local variables, for predicates that gate on another component's state |
| `record` | the row a record surface is bound to, when there is one |
| `current_user` | an alias of whatever you published as `user`; the host's `ExpressionProvider` publishes the signed-in user there |

A name outside that set resolves to nothing, and an unresolvable template is not an error:
the evaluator hands back its own source text, so the characters you typed are what the reader
sees.

> **`dataSource` is not an expression root.** `SchemaRendererProvider`'s `dataSource` carries
> the host's `DataSource` *adapter* — the object renderers call `find()` on. The renderer used
> to publish that adapter under the name `data`; an adapter answers no `data.*` path, so the
> root was constant for every conformant host, and objectui#9308 removed it. A `${data.…}`
> expression now reads whatever *you* published under `data`, and nothing if you published
> none. At the runtime layer the row is `record` (ADR-0089).

### Accessing Data in Schemas

Use expression syntax `${}` to reference the scope, by the name you published it under:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "content": "Welcome, ${user.name}!"
}
```

## Component Registry

The schema renderer uses a component registry to map schema types to React components:

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — MyComponent is the reader's own React component, named here to show what register() takes as its second argument -->
```tsx
import { ComponentRegistry } from '@object-ui/core'

// `ComponentRegistry` is a process-level singleton — import it, do not construct one.
// Register a custom component
ComponentRegistry.register('my-component', MyComponent)

// Now you can use it in schemas
const schema = {
  type: "my-component",
  // ... component props
}
```

## Nested Schemas

Schemas can be nested to create complex UIs:

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "title": "Dashboard",
  "body": {
    "type": "grid",
    "columns": 2,
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "card",
        "title": "Card 1",
        "body": {
          "type": "text",
          "content": "Nested content"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "card",
        "title": "Card 2",
        "body": {
          "type": "chart",
          "chartType": "bar",
          "xAxisKey": "month",
          "series": [{ "name": "revenue" }],
          "data": [
            { "month": "Jan", "revenue": 120 },
            { "month": "Feb", "revenue": 80 }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The chart's rows are written out on the node, and that is the spelling that plots. A
`${…}` on node-level `data` is **not** one of the rows `SchemaRenderer` evaluates: the raw
string reaches `ChartRenderer`, whose `Array.isArray(schema.data) ? schema.data : []` drops
it, and the chart frame draws with nothing in it — no error, no warning. Since objectui#7113
that node is also refused by name, `ChartSchema.data` being `z.array(z.record(…))`. `series`
is required alongside it: `series[].name` picks the column to plot within each row, and
`xAxisKey` names the category column. `chart` reads no `bind` either, so resolve the array in
your own code and hand `SchemaRenderer` a schema whose rows are already on the node.

## Array Rendering

Use arrays for multiple items:

```json
{
  "type": "container",
  "children": [
    { "type": "text", "content": "First item" },
    { "type": "text", "content": "Second item" },
    { "type": "text", "content": "Third item" }
  ]
}
```

## Expression System

Object UI includes a powerful expression system for dynamic behavior:

### Simple Expressions

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "content": "${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}"
}
```

### Conditional Expressions

```json
{
  "type": "card",
  "title": "${status === 'active' ? 'Active' : 'Inactive'}",
  "description": "${status === 'active' ? 'This record is in use.' : 'This record is archived.'}"
}
```

`card` here rather than `badge`, because an expression is evaluated only on a key the
node's own type carries. `expressionBindableTextKeysFor` — the lookup `SchemaRenderer`
consumes out of `@objectstack/spec` — gives `card` the rows `title` and `description`,
and gives `badge` no rows at all, so a `${…}` written on a badge reaches the DOM as the
characters you typed. Resolve a badge's text before you hand the schema over, and author
it on `label`: `text` is not a `BadgeSchema` key.

### Visibility Control

```json
{
  "type": "button",
  "label": "Delete",
  "visibleOn": "${user.role === 'admin'}"
}
```

### Complex Logic

```json
{
  "type": "alert",
  "variant": "default",
  "title": "Welcome!",
  "body": {
    "type": "text",
    "content": "${
      user.isNew ? 'Start with the quick tour.' :
      user.tasks.length === 0 ? 'You are all caught up.' :
      'You have tasks waiting.'
    }"
  }
}
```

The branch sits on the nested `text` node's `content`, which `SchemaRenderer` evaluates
on every node type — the escape hatch for a component that carries no expression rows of
its own, and `alert` is one of those. Its severity could not be chosen by expression in
any case: `AlertSchema.variant` is the closed set `default` | `destructive`, so `info`,
`warning` and `success` are not values it accepts. Pick the variant in the host and
author it as a literal.

## Event Handling

Components can emit events that you handle in React:

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — prop excerpt: the JSX call is shown alone to isolate onAction and onSubmit; schema and SchemaRenderer come from the first example on this page -->
```tsx
<SchemaRenderer 
  schema={schema}
  onAction={(action, context) => {
    console.log('Action:', action)
    console.log('Context:', context)
  }}
  onSubmit={(data) => {
    console.log('Form submitted:', data)
  }}
/>
```

Reference actions in schemas:

```json
{
  "type": "action:button",
  "name": "call_api",
  "label": "Click Me",
  "actionType": "api",
  "endpoint": "/api/action",
  "method": "POST"
}
```

Three things about the shape this replaces. A declarative action is its own NODE TYPE,
`action:button` — a plain `button` has no authorable handler: `ButtonSchema.onClick` is a
runtime slot for a host-supplied function, refused by name by the zod mirror, and (being
on `SDUI_DOM_PASS_THROUGH_KEYS`) forwarded straight to the DOM listener slot, where React
throws on the first click: "Expected `onClick` listener to be a function, instead got a
value of `object` type." The execution type is `actionType`, and the built-in vocabulary
is `script` | `url` | `modal` | `flow` | `api` | `form` (plus objectui's `navigation`
alias) — anything else must be a handler your host registered on `ActionProvider`. `ajax`
is neither. And the endpoint key is `endpoint`, with `method`; `api` is not a key any
action renderer forwards.

## Performance Optimization

### Lazy Loading

Large schemas are automatically optimized:

```json
{
  "type": "tabs",
  "lazyLoad": true,
  "tabs": [
    { "title": "Tab 1", "body": { /* Loaded when tab is clicked */ } },
    { "title": "Tab 2", "body": { /* Loaded when tab is clicked */ } }
  ]
}
```

### Memoization

The renderer automatically memoizes components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### Code Splitting

Use dynamic imports for heavy components:

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — code-splitting excerpt: ./HeavyChart is the reader's own component file, and registry is whichever registry instance the host already holds -->
```tsx
import { lazy } from 'react'

const HeavyChart = lazy(() => import('./HeavyChart'))

registry.register('heavy-chart', HeavyChart)
```

## Error Handling

The renderer includes built-in error boundaries:

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — prop excerpt: the JSX call is shown alone to isolate onError; schema and SchemaRenderer come from the first example on this page -->
```tsx
<SchemaRenderer 
  schema={schema}
  onError={(error, errorInfo) => {
    console.error('Rendering error:', error)
    // Log to error tracking service
  }}
/>
```

## TypeScript Support

Full type safety for your schemas:

```tsx
import type { PageNodeSchema, FormSchema } from '@object-ui/types'

const form: FormSchema = {
  type: "form",
  // TypeScript will validate this entire structure
  fields: []
}

const schema: PageNodeSchema = {
  type: "page",
  title: "Typed Page",
  body: [form]
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Schemas Simple

Break complex UIs into smaller, reusable schemas:

```tsx
// ❌ Bad: One massive schema
const massiveSchema = { /* 500 lines of JSON */ }

// ✅ Good: Composed schemas
const headerSchema = { /* ... */ }
const contentSchema = { /* ... */ }
const footerSchema = { /* ... */ }

const pageSchema = {
  type: "page",
  body: [headerSchema, contentSchema, footerSchema]
}
```

### 2. Use Data Context Effectively

Put everything the schema's expressions need on one scope, mounted above the tree — not on
the renderer, which does not read it:

```tsx
import { SchemaRenderer, PredicateScopeProvider } from '@object-ui/react'
import type { BaseSchema } from '@object-ui/types'

// The reader's own values.
declare const schema: BaseSchema
declare const userData: { name: string }
declare const userSettings: { theme: string }
declare const dashboardStats: { totalUsers: number }

// ✅ Good — one provider, and every expression reads a name published on it
const scope = {
  user: userData,
  settings: userSettings,
  stats: dashboardStats,
}

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <PredicateScopeProvider scope={scope}>
      <SchemaRenderer schema={schema} />
    </PredicateScopeProvider>
  )
}
```

### 3. Leverage Expressions

Move logic to expressions instead of creating conditional schemas:

<!-- doc-snippet: fragment — a bad/good contrast pair in one fence: schema is deliberately declared twice so the two spellings sit side by side, and user, adminSchema and userSchema are the reader's own values -->
```tsx
// ❌ Bad
const schema = user.isAdmin ? adminSchema : userSchema

// ✅ Good
const schema = {
  type: "page",
  body: [
    { 
      type: "admin-panel",
      visibleOn: "${user.isAdmin}"
    },
    {
      type: "user-panel",
      visibleOn: "${!user.isAdmin}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Use TypeScript

Always type your schemas for better IDE support and fewer runtime errors.

## Common Patterns

### Loading States

```json
{
  "type": "container",
  "children": {
    "type": "spinner",
    "visibleOn": "${loading}"
  }
}
```

### Empty States

```json
{
  "type": "empty",
  "visibleOn": "${items.length === 0}",
  "message": "No items found",
  "action": {
    "type": "button",
    "label": "Create New"
  }
}
```

### Error States

```json
{
  "type": "alert",
  "variant": "destructive",
  "visibleOn": "${error}",
  "title": "Something went wrong",
  "body": { "type": "text", "content": "${error.message}" }
}
```

`visibleOn` is a condition key and is evaluated on every node type. The message text is a
nested `text` node because `alert` carries no expression rows — and `message` is not an
`AlertSchema` key at all: the alert's own text keys are `title` and `description`, and the
renderer falls back from `description` to `body`. `destructive` is the variant this state
wants; `error` is not in the closed set.
