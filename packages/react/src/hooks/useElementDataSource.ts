 * Runtime half of consuming `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` — the spec's
 * `ElementDataSourceSchema` per-element data binding (objectstack#5576).
 *
 * `@object-ui/core` owns the pure half (telling the binding apart from a runtime
 * adapter, matching a view name, composing the view with the binding's own keys).
 * This hook owns the part that needs React and a data source: FETCHING the
 * object's saved views so `view` can be resolved to real columns/filter/sort.
 *
 * It lives in `@object-ui/react` rather than in the one plugin that consumes it
 * today because the binding is declared on EVERY page component: `list-view`
 * reads it here, `element:record_picker` already reads `schema.dataSource` (and
 * still ignores `view`), and the remaining object-bound blocks will need the same
 * resolution. One resolver in the runtime layer, not one per plugin.
