/**
 * Does a form have anything to submit TO? — the ONE answer for every renderer
 * `ObjectForm` routes to (objectui#6300).
 *
 * ## What went wrong
 *
 * Each of the five variant containers opened `handleSubmit` with
 *
 *     if (!dataSource) { await schema.onSuccess?.(data); return data; }
 *
 * — a SUCCESS signal emitted without consulting `submitHandler` and without
 * persisting anything. Measured on `main` with a `submitHandler` supplied and no
 * `dataSource`, all five read `onSuccess 1 / submitHandler 0`. Through
 * `MasterDetailForm` — whose parent schema declares BOTH
 * `submitHandler: submitViaBatch` and `onSuccess: handleSaved` — that early
 * return reached `handleSaved` directly: a success toast (measured:
 * `toast.success("Created")`) and, in create mode, a form reset clearing the
 * line items nobody wrote. Silent data loss in the worst direction, because the
 * submitter is told it worked.
 *
 * ## The rule this module carries
 *
 * A form has a submit target when it has EITHER a `dataSource` (it writes) or a
 * declared `submitHandler` (the host writes — objectui#6176's seam, which needs
 * no adapter of its own). With neither, exactly one shape is still legitimate:
 * fields authored INLINE, where the author's `onSuccess` IS the write. Anything
 * else must refuse, loudly, instead of confirming.
 *
 * ## What counts as inline, and why it has two limbs
 *
 * Neither limb is a new predicate. Both name a shape this package already
 * documents as working with no adapter, and the test refuses everything else.
 *
 * **(a) `customFields` is non-empty.** `SimpleObjectForm` (`ObjectForm.tsx`)
 * gates its own carve-out on exactly this, the `object-form` element gate
 * (`index.tsx`) declares `requiresDataSource={!(schema?.customFields?.length > 0)
 * && …}` and says so in as many words — *"The one escape hatch is inline
 * `customFields`, which is exactly what `hasInlineFields` gates on inside the
 * component, so the two stay in step"* — and `ObjectFormSchema` glosses the key
 * as *"when used with inline field definitions (without dataSource), this
 * becomes the primary field source"*.
 *
 * **(b) every section field is an inline runtime `FormField`.** This limb is not
 * optional and not an invention: it is how a sectioned form expresses the same
 * thing with no `customFields` at all — its sections carry the definitions.
 * This package's README documents the shape and ships an example of
 * it, `<WizardForm schema={wizard} />` under the comment *"dataSource omitted:
 * every step lists inline fields"*, introduced by *"The inline shape is what
 * lets a wizard run with no data source at all"*. Measured before this module
 * existed: that example renders and submits. A `customFields`-only test would
 * have made the repo's own published example throw — which is why the limb is
 * here.
 *
 * The limb is deliberately ALL-or-nothing, and it is the taxonomy
 * `normalizeSectionField` already keeps: a section field is a name string
 * (shape 1), a spec `FormFieldSchema` whose identity key `field` is a STRING
 * (shape 2), or an inline runtime `FormField` carrying its own `name` (shape 3).
 * Only shape 3 is self-describing; shapes 1 and 2 name fields that only an
 * object schema — and therefore only an adapter — can resolve. So one bare name
 * anywhere in the sections means the form DID need metadata it could not get,
 * and it refuses. Erring that way is the loud direction; the silent one is the
 * defect.
 *
 * `TabbedForm` / `SplitForm` / `WizardForm` receive `customFields` through
 * `ObjectForm`'s `{...schema}` spread. Until objectui#10254 they neither
 * declared nor rendered it, and limb (a) read it there only as a SIGNAL; they
 * now declare it and draw a member a section names, as the drawer and modal do.

 * inline either: shape 3 without one is what used to crash the form renderer on
