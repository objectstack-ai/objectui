/**
 * Pin tests for `scripts/check-readme-exports.mjs` (objectui#5043).
 *
 * ## Why the planted mutations are in here and not in a prose paragraph
 *
 * The tree is GREEN AT REST: zero fabricated README imports when this landed,
 * and the intent is that there stay zero. So the gate's own run proves nothing
 * about whether it can FAIL, and "I planted a fake name and it caught it" in a
 * pull-request body proves it once and then stops being true. The card recorded
 * three method iterations that each looked right and each was measured wrong,
 * so the four discriminating directions live below as assertions.
 *
 * Recall alone is not enough, and that is the whole reason for the second one:
 *
 *   1. a fabricated name in a MULTI-LINE import block   -> must be REPORTED
 *   2. a fabricated name in a TRAILING `//` COMMENT     -> must NOT be reported
 *   3. `X as Y` where X is fabricated                   -> reported as X
 *   4. a fabricated name MID-BLOCK in a type import     -> must be REPORTED
 *
 * (2) is the false positive the second prototype produced; a gate tested only
 * for recall passes with it present and reddens correct documentation.
 *
 * ## And why there is a fixture tree rather than a scan of this repository
 *
 * The end-to-end verdict needs each package's DECLARED TYPE ENTRY on disk,
 * which for almost every package here is a built `dist/index.d.ts`. The test
 * shards run `pnpm install` and then `pnpm test` — they never build. A suite
 * that scanned this repository for its verdicts would therefore assert nothing
 * in CI while passing locally, which is this gate's own defect one directory
 * over. So the verdicts are asserted against a fixture tree that carries its
 * own hand-written `.d.ts` files, and the assertions about THIS repository
 * below are written to hold in both states and to say which one they are in.

/**
 * The build state of THIS repository: the per-package split every assertion
 * below partitions by, and one line naming it, fit to end an assertion message.
 *
 * objectui#7460. The three cases underneath used to split the tree with the
 * whole-tree boolean `census.packagesUnbuilt === 0`, one leg for "built" and one
 * for "unbuilt". A PARTLY built tree is a third state neither leg describes, and
 * it is not exotic — it is what another gate's own printed command produces:
 *
 *   pnpm exec turbo run build $(node scripts/check-doc-snippet-types.mjs --build-filter) --concurrency=2
 *
 * That filter covers, by design, only the packages the documents IT judges
 * import (26 of 40 here), so "run the doc gate, then run the tests that read it"
 * lands there. In it the unbuilt leg judged a mostly-built tree and two cases
 * failed with `expected false to be true` and `expected +0 to be 3` — naming
 * neither the counter nor the state, under titles promising the assertion held
 * in every state. Measured cost: one round, spent suspecting the diff under test.
 *
 * Both halves of that are fixed, and they are separate fixes:
 *
 *   the SPLIT    is now per PACKAGE, which is the split the gate itself already
 *                uses (see "THE SHRINK-ONLY RULE IS SUSPENDED WHERE NOTHING WAS
 *                COMPARED" in check-readme-exports.mjs). It is not a second
 *                build-state semantics, and it enumerates no states: built,
 *                unbuilt and every mix fall out of one rule, so there is no
 *                fourth state left to be surprised by. Measured while writing
 *                this: there WAS a fourth. `packages/plugin-tree` is unbuilt
 *                with zero README self-imports, so on a tree with only it
 *                unbuilt the old "the gate must FAIL" line reddened a correct
 *                tree — a second break in the same leg, from the same cause.
 *   the MESSAGE  names `census.packagesUnbuilt` and the packages behind it, and
 *                says outright that the state is not the cause — because after
 *                the split above it cannot be. That is the half that buys the
 *                round back, and it is owed even on assertions needing no leg.

 *
 * objectui#7302. This used to be spelled `Object.keys(PARTIAL_EXCERPTS)`
 * filtered by build state — the LEDGER half, alone. That was complete only
 * while every excerpt in the tree was a ledger entry. The moment a content fix
 * moved one to the in-README `PARTIAL_MARKER` — which is the disposition a
 * GENUINE excerpt is meant to end at, and the ledger's own reason said so —
 * the two assertions below expected 0 where the gate counted 1, and they went
 * red on CI: on the UNBUILT tree the shards run, which is the only state this
 * can fire in. The gate counts BOTH mechanisms in that one counter, on purpose
 * and in one sentence of its header ("BOTH suppress `stale-omission` ... both
 * are counted as `not judged` in the census"), so both belong in the
 * expectation, under the same per-PACKAGE rule the rest of these cases use.
 *
 * DERIVED FROM THE READMEs, never from the counter under test: the ledger half
 * from the exported literal, the marker half by re-reading each README of an
 * unbuilt package through the gate's own exported grammar. So these assertions
 * still cross-check the gate against something that is not the gate's count.
 *
 * The marker half is the population of the gate's `excerptFor` map — a marker
 * that BINDS a fence and carries a long enough reason — restricted to unbuilt
 * packages, and it deliberately does not re-parse the block to confirm the type
 * is declared there: a bound marker whose fence declares no type of that name
 * is reported `stale-partial-marker` in EVERY build state, and the case below
 * asserts there are none of those. Keyed the way the gate keys it
 * (`<fence>::<Name>`, per README), so a repeated marker collapses here exactly
 * as it collapses there.

/**
 * `--list` on an UNBUILT tree (objectui#9220).
 *
 * ## Why this block exists and what the ablation leg is
 *
 * `--list` is this gate's own documented diagnostic and the only state a
 * developer reaches for it in is the state where the gate just failed. It used
 * to CRASH there: the row formatter read `t.fabricated.length` behind a guard
 * that whitelisted two literal verdicts, `unjudgeable-type` was not one of
 * them, and the run died on the first declaration it could not judge —
 * `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`, with no
 * census, no row past that one, and exit 1, the same code the gate uses to
 * report a genuinely fabricated name.
 *
 * ⭐ THE ABLATION LEG, and the reason this block asserts a SHAPE and not only
 * the absence of a throw: back `documentedTypeRow` out of the
 * `unjudgeable-type` push in `check-readme-exports.mjs` — restore the bare
 * `documentedTypes.push({ ...site, verdict: 'unjudgeable-type' })` — and
 * `renderList` throws again on the fixture below. Both the "prints every row"
 * case and the identical-key-set case go red; the exit-code cases go red too,
 * because nothing returns at all. Measured, not predicted, on this branch —
 * the numbers are in the pull request.
 *
 * The whitelist is NOT the repair, and this block is written so that re-adding
 * one would not satisfy it: a third verdict string would make TODAY's row safe
 * and leave the construct — a field-access guard enumerated by verdict — intact
 * for the next verdict anyone adds. What is asserted below is that EVERY row
 * carries the same key set, which is a fact about fields rather than about the
 * membership of a list.
