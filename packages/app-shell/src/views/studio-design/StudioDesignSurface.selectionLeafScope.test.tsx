/**
 * objectui#7137 — the Interfaces pillar's block `selection` must not outlive a
 * leaf change.
 *
 * ## The mechanism it pins
 *
 * `InterfacesPillar`'s draft-load effect used to be the only thing that cleared
 * the selection, and its clear sat AFTER the guard:
 *
 *     if (!current || !isEditable) { setDraft({}); setHasDraft(false); return; }
 *     …
 *     setSelection(null);   // never reached on the early-return path
 *
 * So walking from a leaf with a block selected to any leaf where
 * `isEditable === false` carried the selection across, and it then described a
 * block on the PREVIOUS leaf's canvas.
 *
 * The repair keys the selection to the leaf it was made on — the same
 * "expires by construction" shape `blockingReport` already uses against
 * `inspectorKey` in this component — so a leaf change nulls it in the SAME
 * render rather than one committed render later.
 *
 * ## Two populations, two different observables — both are pinned here
 *
 * `isEditable = !!Preview && !StudioCanvas` is a conjunction, so it is false
 * for two disjoint reasons, and #7121's landed gating covers only one of them:
 *
 *   (a) **studio-canvas leaves** (`object`). #7121 gates the rail and the
 *       header's clear button on `StudioCanvas`, so both of those symptoms are
 *       already unreachable here. What it did NOT gate is `hasInspectorTarget`,
 *       which feeds `nextCenterTab` — so in the folded layout the ONLY
 *       surviving observable of the leak is the center tab, and that is what
 *       the folded-layout test below measures.
 *
 *   (b) **leaves whose own type has no registered designer**. Nothing gates
 *       this population: the stale selection reaches the
 *       `selection && Inspector && current` rail branch directly and opens the
 *       scoped inspector for a foreign block. Pinned via a mount LEDGER rather
 *       than a point-in-time query, because the defect being excluded is a
 *       mount that is torn down again a render later.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The registry is POPULATED on purpose
 *
 * Same precondition as `StudioDesignSurface.designerRegistryPartial.test.tsx`:
 * a designer is registered for an unrelated type, so a `page` leaf lands in the
 * no-designer branch for reason (1) "this type has none" — a product fact — and
 * not for #6795 part C's reason (2) "the registries never loaded". A
 * zero-registry reading would measure that other card instead.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Do NOT re-fence this on `isEditable`
 *
 * The discriminator for #7121's rail / Design-mode gating is `StudioCanvas`,
 * never `isEditable` — `StudioDesignSurface.designerRegistryPartial.test.tsx`
 * is the live fence for that and goes red on the substitution. This card is the
 * opposite direction: the STATE lifecycle, which is correctly keyed to the leaf
 * and not to either discriminator.
