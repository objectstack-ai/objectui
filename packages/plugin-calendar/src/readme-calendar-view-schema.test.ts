/**
 * `packages/plugin-calendar/README.md`'s "Schema API -> CalendarView" fence
 * describes real `CalendarViewSchema` keys, with the requiredness the schema
 * actually declares (objectui#5045).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The fence had drifted from the type in four separate ways at once, and every
 * one of them was reader-facing on the npm landing page:
 *
 *   - `events?` — the schema's ONLY required key besides `type`, published as
 *     optional. A reader following the README omits it and TypeScript rejects
 *     the node;
 *   - `defaultDate?: string` — the schema says `string | Date`;
 *   - `onDateClick` — not on `CalendarViewSchema` at all. It is a
 *     `CalendarViewProps` prop, i.e. a different package's *component* surface,
 *     so the README sent readers to a key the schema does not have;
 *   - six keys of thirteen listed, with nothing saying the list was partial.
 *
 * Nothing was holding the fence to the type, so all four drifted silently and
 * were found by reading. That is the failure mode `readme-registration-keys`
 * in `@object-ui/layout` names for the same class of defect: "someone read it"
 * is not a mechanism. This card's fix was another hand-correction; this pin is
 * what stops the next one being needed.
 *
 * ## Exhaustiveness is deliberately NOT asserted
 *
 * The fence is a declared PARTIAL summary — it names the author-facing keys and
 * points at `CalendarViewSchema` for the rest. A pin demanding all thirteen
 * would convert an editorial choice into a gate and force every future schema
 * key into the README. What is asserted is the direction that misleads a
 * reader: a key the README names must EXIST, and must carry the requiredness
 * the schema gives it.
 *
 * ## Both sides are parsed from source, never restated here
 *
 * Hardcoding the key list in this file would reproduce the defect one layer up
 * — the README was itself a confident hand-written restatement of the schema.
 * So `CalendarViewSchema` and `BaseSchema` are read out of
 * `packages/types/src/*.ts` on every run, and a red test here always means "fix
 * the README (or the schema)", never "update the test". A moved or renamed
 * interface fails LOUDLY rather than vacuously passing an empty key set.
