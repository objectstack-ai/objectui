/**
 * Client-side resolution of per-option visibility for `select` / `radio` /
 * `multiselect` fields — cascading (dependent) options and role/context gating.
 *
 * An option carries an optional `visibleWhen` CEL predicate; the option is
 * offered only when it evaluates TRUE against the live record + `current_user`
 * (the SAME engine and binding environment as a field-level `visibleWhen`, via
 * {@link evalFieldPredicate}). This expresses both:
 *   - cascades — `record.country == 'cn'` (the dependent list narrows as the
 *     controlling field changes), and
 *   - role/context gating — `'admin' in current_user.positions`.
 *
 * A field declares which sibling fields its option list reacts to via
 * `dependsOn` (aligns with `@objectstack/spec` Field.dependsOn — the same knob
 * lookups use). While any dependency is empty the list is *gated*: we surface a
 * "select the parent first" hint instead of an unfiltered set, mirroring the
 * dependent-lookup UX (#2215).
 *
 * Evaluation is fail-open (a broken/absent predicate keeps the option) — the
 * same safe default as field visibility. Client-side hiding is UX, not a
 * security boundary: when an option is gated for access-control reasons the
 * server must also reject writes of its value.

/**
 * The text an option widget SHOWS for one option: its `label`, or its `value`
 * when the label is blank (objectui#9230).
 *
 * ## Why a blank label reaches a renderer at all — it is a LEGAL document
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT the lenient renderer fallback AGENTS.md #0.1
 * forbids. That rule governs metadata the contract REFUSES ("if the metadata
 * is off-spec, fix it at the producer"); an empty label is metadata the
 * contract ACCEPTS. Measured on the installed `@objectstack/spec` 17.4.0,
 * `SelectOptionSchema`:
 *
 *   { value: 'low', label: 'Low' } -> ACCEPT   (lit control)
 *   { value: 'low', label: '' }    -> ACCEPT   <- the key reading
 *   { value: 'low' }               -> REJECT invalid_type at [label]
 *
 * `@object-ui/types` mirrors that reading in prose on `SelectOptionBase`:
 * "An empty string is a valid label; an ABSENT one is not." So the producer
 * is right to emit `label: ''` — the field designer's `patchOptions` does,
 * under the objectui#7014 Q2 ruling, and a pin
 * (`ObjectFieldInspector.optionLabel.test.tsx`) fails if it ever invents
 * content to fill the hole instead. A document every layer calls legal has to
 * render as something a person can click.
 *
 * ## What the contract does NOT say, and who had already answered it
 *
 * The spec states no display default for a legal-but-blank label, so nothing
 * upstream decides this. objectui had nevertheless already decided it — on
 * HALF its read sites. Measured across the four option widgets before this
 * helper existed, with `{ value: 'low', label: '' }` authored and
 * `{ value: 'high', label: 'High' }` beside it as the lit control:
 *
 *   | widget      | readonly path      | interactive path |
 *   | select      | "low"              | ""               |
 *   | multiselect | "low"              | ""               |
 *   | radio       | "low"              | ""               |
 *   | checkboxes  | "low"              | ""               |
 *
 * Four summary paths spelled `opt?.label || value` and fell back; the four
 * interactive paths spelled `{opt.label}` and rendered nothing. So the same
 * option read "low" in a read-only form and blank in the editable one — the
 * bug was never "tolerate or refuse", it was a widget family disagreeing with
 * itself, and the blank half is the one a person has to click.
 *
 * This function is that decision written ONCE, the same "one definition, N
 * surfaces" move as {@link CASCADE_OPTION_WIDGET_TYPES} below. All eight sites
 * call it, so the two halves cannot drift apart again.
 *
 * ## Boundaries
 *
 * - Blank means TRIM-empty, so a whitespace-only label falls back too: it is
 *   the same invisible row to the person looking at it, and it is the
 *   spelling the producer's own reader already uses to call an authored
 *   `value` blank (`classifyOption`, `o.value.trim() === ''`).
 * - `label` is typed required, but this reads defensively because renderers
 *   are handed unvalidated runtime metadata: a non-string label must fall back
 *   rather than throw where `{opt.label}` merely rendered nothing.
 * - This changes DISPLAY only. It writes nothing, and it is not a licence to
 *   author blank labels — whether the contract should refuse them outright is
 *   a `packages/spec` question, not a renderer one.

 * declare a `dependsOn` gate (ADR-0058 / objectui#2284 / objectui#1583).
 * Without the record a cascading select never sees its controlling field and
 * stays permanently gated on the "select the parent first" hint.
 *
 * ## One definition, three surfaces (objectui#4770)
 *
 * Three surfaces feed this one evaluator, and each carried its own private copy
 * of these four keys until this constant existed — with no gate able to notice
 * them drifting apart on what "the record" means:
 *
 * - the object form — `CASCADE_OPTION_FIELD_TYPES` in
 *   `components/src/renderers/form/form.tsx` (the original);
 * - the single-record action dialog — `CASCADE_OPTION_WIDGET_TYPES` in
 *   `app-shell/src/views/ActionParamDialog.tsx` (objectui#3765 / PR #4756);
 * - the bulk action dialog — the same name in
 *   `plugin-grid/src/components/BulkActionDialog.tsx` (objectui#4757 / PR #4763).
 *
 * The set lives in `@object-ui/core`, next to the evaluator it describes,
 * because core is the one package all three already depend on — the form layer
 * cannot reach `@object-ui/fields` (that dependency runs the other way). Same
 * shape and same reason as `EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES` in
 * `core/src/utils/expand-fields.ts`, the in-repo precedent for a form-layer
 * allow-table more than one surface reads. `@object-ui/fields` re-exports it
 * next to `resolveFormWidgetType` for discoverability — a re-export, never a
 * second definition.
 *
 * ## An ALLOW-LIST, not a blanket pass-through
 *
 * `dependentValues` is also the channel two widget-hint pickers read a specific
 * SIBLING KEY from (`filter-condition` reads `object_name`, `recipient-picker`
 * reads `recipient_type`), and the lookup family filters its query by it. All
 * three surfaces above agree today in NOT feeding those from action / bulk
 * dialog params, but that is a different wiring question from the one ruled
 * here and it has never been decided either way. Stated here so the three
 * copies of the statement become one — the boundary itself stays open:
 * objectui#4771.
 *
 * ## Normalization stays with the consumer
 *
 * The members are WIDGET keys — `resolveFormWidgetType` output in the two
 * dialogs, `normalizeFieldType` output (the `field:` prefix stripped) in the
 * form — not authored `type` spellings. Each consumer keeps its own
 * normalization; the two normalizations agree on these four members, which is
 * what makes one shared set safe to read from both.
 *
 * `select` + `multiple: true` is not listed separately: `SelectField` delegates
 * to `MultiSelectField` with the whole prop object, so the key it resolves
 * under (`select`) is the one that must carry the record.
