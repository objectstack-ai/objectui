/**
 * Server-side grouping for a grid that owns its fetch (objectui#7189,
 * maintainer ruling A: 「7189 A  其他同意」).
 *
 * ## The contract this module consumes
 *
 * Grouping on a list view is server-side: the set of groups and every number
 * in a group header are properties of the QUERY, not of a fetched page, and
 * the rows inside a group are paged. `@objectstack/spec/ui` compiles a grouped
 * view into the two queries that say so, and this module sends exactly what
 * they compile — it never re-derives either:
 *
 *   - {@link compileListViewGroupQuery} — the GROUP HEADER query, one
 *     `EngineAggregateOptions` per nesting depth, answered through
 *     `DataSource.queryGroupHeaders` (`@object-ui/types`). One query per depth
 *     rather than one leaf query folded upward, because `avg` and
 *     `count_distinct` do not fold across levels (the spec module's own
 *     "Multi-level grouping" note); `count`, the number every header shows, is
 *     exact either way.
 *   - {@link compileListViewGroupRowsQuery} — ONE group's row page: the view's
 *     composed filter AND-ed with that group's key predicate, `limit` /
 *     `offset` per group, answered through the ordinary `DataSource.find`.
 *
 * Both take the view's composed filter as the same `FilterCondition`, so the
 * header numbers and the rows they head are one question asked twice rather
 * than two questions that might disagree.
 *
 * ## A search rides on BOTH queries (objectui#11021)
 *
 * `EngineAggregateOptions` declares ADR-0061 `search` / `searchFields` beside
 * `where` (`@objectstack/spec` 17.5.0, objectstack#20487), and the platform's
 * grouped branch expands them with the same expander its flat `find` uses. So
 * the grid's search term goes on the header query AND on every group's row
 * query, as ONE pair: {@link groupSearchOf} reads the header's pair off the
 * very row query each group's page is asked with. The header then counts the
 * searched rows, and the rows it heads are those rows. ⛔ Never on one of the
 * two alone: searched rows under unsearched counts (or the reverse) is two
 * questions that disagree. `compileListViewGroupQuery` compiles grouping and
 * `where` and takes no search, so the pair is set on the options it compiles,
 * under the spec's own key names.
 *
 * ## What a header row carries, and what the grid still has to do
 *
 * Every grouped field under its own name holding the RAW stored value — a
 * lookup key is the referenced record's id, never the record, and the empty
 * group's key is `null`. Resolving a key to a label is the consumer's, exactly
 * as for a cell, so a reference-typed grouping key is resolved here with one
 * `find` on the referenced object per grouped field (the same resolution
 * `ObjectChart` applies to a grouped series); a failed resolution keeps the id
 * rather than failing the grid. Ordering the groups is the consumer's too:
 * `useGroupedData` applies `GroupingField.order` over the header set.
 *
 * ## An answer is held against the question it answers (objectui#11574)
 *
 * Both hooks record what they hold WITH the question it answers — the object,
 * the grouping fields, and the query they compile with (the composed filter,
 * the search pair and, for the headers, the summary columns) — and read a
 * held answer only under that same question, at once, in the render the
 * question changes. A header row carries only the fields it was grouped by,
 * so the previous field's header set read under the next field's name is
 * every row keyed `null`: one `(empty)` group per old header, all on the same
 * composite key, which React cannot reconcile (the stale duplicates outlive
 * the real answer as phantom headers stuck on "Loading grid…"). A group row
 * page is held by composite key, and two fields can share a key (`0:high`
 * under `priority` and under `impact`), so the previous field's page — one
 * answered after the switch included — would render under the next field's
 * group. A refresh (`reloadKey`) re-asks the SAME question, so it keeps the
 * answer in hand on screen while it reloads; any other change starts with
 * none.
