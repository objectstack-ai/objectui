/**
 * `packages/data-objectstack/README.md`'s filter-operator tables are held to
 * `@object-ui/core`'s `convertFiltersToAST` — the code that decides every row
 * (objectui#8558).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The "Supported Filter Operators" table was a hand-written mirror of the
 * `operatorMap` inside `convertOperatorToAST`, and by objectui#8558 it had
 * drifted from the code in three independent ways at once:
 *
 *   - `$nin` / `$notin` were documented as lowering to `notin`, with a worked
 *     example whose OUTPUT read `['status', 'notin', ['archived']]`. The map
 *     says `nin`. A reader who copied the example got a node the server
 *     refuses;
 *   - `$regex` was documented as lowering to `contains`. That downgrade was
 *     retired (objectui#8447 / PR #8512): `$regex` is REFUSED with a
 *     `FilterOperatorError`, because a substring match is a different
 *     question, not a weaker version of the same one;
 *   - only `$startswith` was listed, while the map carried both spellings and
 *     `$startsWith` is the spec's (`FILTER_OPERATORS`, `data/filter.zod.ts`).
 *     The lowercase half was retired outright by objectui#8568; this pin is
 *     what named the four rows that had to change with it.
 *
 * Re-deriving the whole table for that card found the rest of the drift: four
 * operators the code's own "Supported operators:" message enumerates —
 * `$notContains`, `$endsWith`, `$null`, `$exists` — had no row at all, and
 * neither did the `$and` / `$or` combinators nor the `$not` refusal.
 *
 * Three drifts in one table is the signal that hand-maintenance does not
 * survive here — the same shape as the ledger figures in
 * `packages/types/src/__tests__/zod-mirror-parity.test.ts` rotting while every
 * pin stayed green (objectui#8252). This file is the smaller version of
 * "generate the table": the table stays authored, and every claim it makes is
 * EXECUTED against the code on every run.
 *
 * ## What is asserted — every claim, by execution, never by a restated list
 *
 *   - every row's worked example is run through `convertFiltersToAST`, and its
 *     documented output must be exactly what the function returns — or, for a
 *     row in the refused table, the function must throw the `INVALID_FILTER`
 *     / 400 envelope the table promises. This is the check that would have
 *     caught the `notin` example: it is a claim about OUTPUT, so it is checked
 *     as one;
 *   - every `$`-spelling in the supported table's first column must lower, and
 *     to exactly the operator(s) its row's second column names. `$null` and
 *     `$exists` are probed with both booleans, so their rows must name both
 *     directions;
 *   - the supported table must carry a row for EVERY key of
 *     `convertOperatorToAST`'s `operatorMap` and for every operator the
 *     unknown-operator error message calls supported (`$null` / `$exists`
 *     live outside the map);
 *   - the two tables TOGETHER must account for every member of the spec's
 *     `FILTER_OPERATORS` — see "The blind spot" below;
 *   - every `$`-spelling in the refused table must be refused, and every
 *     combinator row's keyword must be the one its lowered group carries.
 *
 * ## The expected values are READ OUT OF the code, never listed here
 *
 * Hardcoding `nin` below would rebuild the defect one level up: a second
 * hand-maintained copy, in a test, that would then have to be edited whenever
 * the map changed — the edit everybody makes without reading. So the map is
 * read from `filter-converter.ts`'s source (it is not exported, and a control
 * below proves the read agrees with the runtime), the supported list is read
 * from the error the function throws for an unknown operator, and every
 * lowering comes from calling the function.
 * A red here is always "fix the README (or the code)", never "update the test".
 *
 * ## The blind spot this pin had, and what closes it (objectui#8976)
 *
 * Until objectui#8976 both completeness checks read the SAME two populations,
 * and both were the CODE's: `operatorMap`'s keys, and the operators the
 * unknown-operator error calls supported. That makes the pin exact about drift
 * between the code and the page — and structurally unable to see an operator
 * missing from BOTH sides at once.
 *
 * `$icontains` was exactly that operator. It is a canonical member of
 * `FILTER_OPERATORS`, `ValueDataSource` executed it, `FilterConditionField`
 * emitted it and `packages/core/src/adapters/README.md` PRESCRIBED it — while
 * `convertOperatorToAST` had no row for it and the error message did not list
 * it. Absent from both code-side populations, it was absent from everything
 * this pin derives from them, so the README could carry no row for it in either
 * table and the suite stayed green. A pin that reads only the code cannot
 * report the code being wrong.
 *
 * So a THIRD population is read, and it is the one the code answers TO: the
 * spec's `FILTER_OPERATORS`. Every canonical member must be accounted for by
 * these tables — documented as supported, or documented as refused. Which of
 * the two is not asserted here (that is the code's ruling, and the rows above
 * already hold the tables to it); what is asserted is that no canonical
 * operator is missing from BOTH, because that is the state nothing else can
 * see.
 *
 * ⚠️ Deliberately ONE-DIRECTIONAL. The refused table legitimately carries
 * spellings the spec does NOT declare (`$regex`, and the four lowercase aliases
 * objectui#8568 retired) — documenting a refusal for something outside
 * `FILTER_OPERATORS` is the point of that table, not drift. Asserting the
 * converse would delete it.
 *
 * ## Exhaustiveness IS asserted, deliberately
 *
 * `plugin-calendar`'s `readme-calendar-view-schema.test.ts` declines to assert
 * exhaustiveness because its fence is a declared partial summary. This table
 * is headed "Supported Filter Operators" and is the only place the
 * `$`-dialect lowering is documented for consumers, so a missing row is
 * exactly the omission objectui#8558 counted as a defect. It is held complete
 * in the direction that misleads a reader: every operator the code accepts
 * has a row.
