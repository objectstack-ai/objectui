/**
 * Every operator the FilterBuilder dropdown can DRAW carries a label in every
 * locale pack (objectstack#8815).
 *
 * ## The hole this closes
 *
 * The operator label is looked up with a key the component BUILDS:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * {t(`filterBuilder.operators.${op.value}`)}
 * ```
 *
 * Nothing upstream can check that. `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs`
 * classifies a template key as `missing-prefix` and asks only whether the
 * PREFIX (`filterBuilder.operators`) resolves — it does, sixteen members deep —
 * because there is no static way to know which members a dynamic key needs.
 * `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` asks whether the ten packs AGREE, and its own
 * header records why that is green here by construction: "Ten packs identically
 * missing it is full parity."
 *
 * So six operators — `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `isNull`, `isNotNull`, `exists`,
 * `notExists` — were absent from ALL TEN packs at once and every existing gate
 * was green. What the user saw was the raw key: i18next resolves a missing key
 * to the key itself, and the component's `createSafeTranslation` defaults table
 * cannot save it — that table serves only the NO-PROVIDER path, and the Console
 * mounts a provider, so the pack's answer is the one that renders.
 *
 * The reported repro (a `date` column) shows exactly four of them, because a
 * date field's bucket offers the four nullness operators and not
 * `startsWith`/`endsWith`; a `text` column shows all six. That is why this test
 * asserts over the whole DRAWABLE vocabulary rather than the four that were
 * reported — the defect was never about which bucket the reporter opened.
 *
 * ## Why the assertion is against `FILTER_BUILDER_OPERATORS`
 *
 * That export is the vocabulary the dropdown draws, derived from the operators
 * the component actually renders — so a new operator added to `defaultOperators`
 * lands here as a red test naming the packs it still needs, instead of shipping
 * as a raw key. It includes the opt-in ids (`containsCaseInsensitive`,
 * `exists`, `notExists`): `OPT_IN_OPERATORS` governs which CONSUMERS are offered
 * an operator, not whether the builder can draw it, and `FilterConditionField`
 * grants all three — a drawable operator needs a label.
 *
 * Placement is forced by the dependency graph: `@object-ui/components` depends
 * on `@object-ui/i18n`, so this is the side that can see both the vocabulary and
 * the packs. The reverse import would be a cycle, which is why this guard cannot
 * live beside the other locale-parity tests in `packages/i18n`.
