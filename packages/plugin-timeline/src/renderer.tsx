 * RETIRED (objectui#6355, maintainer ruling 2026-08-27: immediate retirement,

 *
 * A document that still spells `timeScale` no longer reaches this function with

 * left silent: `@object-ui/types` tombstones the key on both halves
 * (`TimelineSchema.timeScale?: never` and the Zod twin's `z.never()`), so the
 * retired spelling is refused at the authoring boundary rather than quietly
 * re-bucketing the chart. The tombstone is why this deletion is safe; the two
 * ship together.

 * scale produces a non-empty header row — `hour` / `quarter` / `year` used to
 * fall through the month/week/day chain and return `[]`, blanking the axis
 * (#2942). Exported for the spec-parity test.
 *
 * `locale` is threaded in rather than read here: this is a pure function, and
 * the session's locale lives behind a hook (#4513). The three `Intl` branches
 * below used to pass a literal `'en-US'`, so a fully Chinese timeline rendered
 * an English axis. The default is `'en'` — the same concrete last resort
 * `useDisplayLocale()` falls back to, and byte-identical to the retired
 * `'en-US'` at all three sites — so the existing 3-argument call sites keep
 * producing exactly what they produced before.
 *
 * `t` is threaded on the same seam and for the same reason (#4520). The two are
 * different kinds of dependency and each covers what the other cannot: a locale
 * TAG formats a date, a TRANSLATION spells a word. The `week` and `quarter`
 * branches never touched `Intl`, so #4513 left them reading `Week 1` / `Q3
 * 2026` on an axis that had just become Chinese. Its default is the package's
 * own defaults table, which is what the channel serves with no `I18nProvider`
 * mounted, so 3- and 4-argument call sites keep producing byte-identical
 * English.
 *
 * ## The empty/degenerate range — the second of #6750's three sites
 *
 * objectui#6750 asked the same empty-list question at all three stops on the
 * gantt branch, so that fixing the one `throw` did not just move the crash two
 * stations down. This one needed no change, and that verdict is recorded here
 * rather than left to be re-derived: the guard on the next line already refuses
 * an unparseable or inverted range by returning NO headers, and a DEGENERATE
 * range (`minDate === maxDate`, which is what `emptyGanttDateRange` hands it)
 * is not inverted — `start > end` is false when they are equal, so the loop
 * runs exactly once and every scale emits exactly one bucket. Measured on
 * b76ca6764, min = max = '2026-03-15': hour `["Mar 15, 12 AM"]`, day
 * `["Mar 15"]`, week `["Week 1"]`, month `["Mar 2026"]`, quarter `["Q1 2026"]`,
 * year `["2026"]`.
 *
 * So the empty gantt gets a real one-column axis, not a header row with zero
 * cells. That composition is what
 * `./__tests__/timeline-gantt-empty-items.test.tsx` pins — separately from the
 * other two sites, so a later change that fixes one and not the others goes
 * red.
 *
 * ## The refusal on the next line is NOT dead code (objectui#6759)
 *
 * #6759 put a guard in the gantt branch that refuses an unparseable or inverted
 * range before this function is ever called, so the `return headers` below can
 * no longer be reached FROM THERE. It was reached before: a `zero-column axis`
 * is exactly what case 2 rendered its negative-width bar under, and the fix was
 * to refuse above rather than to relax the guard here — this function's verdict
 * is still "needed no change".
 *
 * Two reasons it stays. It is EXPORTED and called directly, including by
 * `timeline-gantt-empty-items.test.tsx`'s pin 5a, which holds these exact
 * inputs (`'2030-01-01'` / `'2026-03-15'`, and `''` / `''`) returning `[]`. And
 * it is the reason the caller's guard is allowed to be the only one: an axis
 * that silently drew nothing is what let the row loop below it keep running, so
 * the two guards are one invariant read from both ends, not a duplicate.

/**
 * The date range a gantt falls back to when the rows carry NO dates at all —
 * an authored `items: []`, or rows whose `items` are all empty.
 *
 * ## Why a sentinel and not a throw (objectui#6750)
 *
 * `calculateDateRange` used to reduce the empty list directly: `Math.min()`
 * over no arguments is `Infinity`, and `new Date(Infinity).toISOString()`
 * throws `RangeError: Invalid time value` during render. An empty gantt is not
 * a malformed document — it is the ORDINARY empty state of a valid schema. Any
 * author or generator that builds `items` from a collection produces `items:
 * []` the moment the collection is empty: a filtered project list with no
 * matches, a fresh workspace, a plan whose rows are yet to be added. Crashing
 * the render on that is a correctness defect, not a strict-input policy.
 *
 * ## Why TODAY, and why a single day
 *
 * An empty plan carries no dates of its own, so the axis has to be anchored on
 * something outside the data, and "now" is the only anchor that is not
 * arbitrary. The span is ONE day — the smallest coherent range — because how
 * much time an empty gantt should show is a question about what an empty gantt
 * should LOOK like, and the 2026-08-29 triage on #6750 deliberately left that
 * open (「不要崩」 is the correctness floor it ruled on; 「崩改成空态面板还是零行
 * 图表」 is the product option it did not). A one-day window makes the smallest
 * possible claim: `generateTimeScaleHeaders` turns it into exactly one bucket
 * on every scale, so the axis is valid and non-empty, and the grid below it has
 * zero rows.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It does not reach the caller when the author pinned a range. The gantt branch
 * resolves `schema.minDate || dateRange.minDate`, so an author who pinned an
 * explicit `minDate` / `maxDate` gets EXACTLY that range with no rows in it —
 * most likely what they wanted, and free. Pinned by
 * `./__tests__/timeline-gantt-empty-items.test.tsx`.

 * THE ROW WALK, READ ONCE — objectui#7164 (maintainer ruling 2026-09-02, A+).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * The gantt branch used to read the authored rows twice and read them
 * differently: `findUnusableGanttDate` walked them with `?.` and `|| []` and
 * SKIPPED whatever it could not index, while `calculateDateRange` re-walked the
 * same rows BARE. Every input in the gap crashed the render with a `TypeError`,
 * and all of it is ordinary JSON that the declared zod mirror accepted:
 *
 *     items: [null]                              at `row.items`
 *     items: [{ items: 5 }]  (or true, {}, or    at `(row.items || []).flatMap`
 *            an array-LIKE { length: 1, 0: … })
 *     items: {} / 'x' / 5                        at `items.flatMap`
 *
 * Measured in render on `a67abdc88`, beside five live drawing controls.
 *
 * ⛔ And a guard in any ONE reader does not close the class — it MOVES it.
 * Measured by ablation on `51449a043` (the card) and re-measured here: a
 * tolerant `calculateDateRange` relocated all three crashes into the render
 * loop's `items.map`, `row.label` and `(row.items || []).map`, with the
 * ordinary-row control drawing on both sides of the mutation. That is the
 * relocation this path had performed four times, which is why this function
 * is the ONLY place the raw shape is read and why the three readers below
 * consume its `GanttRow[]` rather than `schema.items`.
 *
 * ## The three refusals, in walk order
 *
 *   1. `items` is not an array         -> path `items`
 *   2. a row is `null` (or `undefined`) -> path `items[i]`
 *   3. `row.items` is a TRUTHY non-array -> path `items[i].items`
 *
 * Each names the authored location and the value — spelled by
 * `spellGanttDateValue`, so no author code runs to describe it — through
 * `timeline.gantt.unusableRange.malformedRow`, a key of its own. It is never
 * the `malformedDate` copy: "items[0] is null, which is not a valid date"
 * names the wrong fault for a row that is not a row, and objectui#6781's ruled
 * date accept set does not answer a question about rows. The first malformed
 * shape wins — rows are judged as rows before their dates are judged as dates.
 *
 * ## The accept set is the ruling's, not a wider one
 *
 * REFUSE, not skip: drawing the well-formed rows and dropping the malformed
 * one silently is the consumer-side tolerance objectui#6750 and objectui#6759
 * both refused, and the ruling declined it (option B). Nor is the set widened
 * past the three lines above. The shapes NEXT to them keep drawing, as
 * measured before the change and pinned as CONTROLS: `items: []`, a row with
 * no `items` key, a row whose `items` is `null` (both the empty row), and a
 * row that is a non-null primitive or an array (`[0]`, `[[]]`), which has no
 * `.items` and draws as an unlabelled empty row. The zod mirror
 * (`@object-ui/types`, `TimelineSchema.items`) refuses those last two at
 * AUTHORING time — an element must be an object — so the door a document
 * meets first is the stricter one; the renderer is only ever more lenient than
 * `validate`, never the reverse, and never crashes on what `validate` admits.
 *
 * ## What this does to the exotic exclusion (objectui#7153, pin 5)
 *
 * The three reads objectui#7153 measured as U1–U3 (`items.length`,
 * `items[rowIndex]`, `row.items`) now happen HERE, once, and they are still
 * not total for a throwing trap — the pinned messages are unchanged because the
 * trap writes them. `Array.isArray` is a NEW non-total site for a revoked
 * `Proxy` (it throws `Cannot perform 'IsArray' …`, the same class
 * `spellGanttDateValue` already declares), so a revoked proxy handed as `items`
 * or as a row's `items` now dies here rather than at U1 / U4. Both moves are
 * stated and exercised in `timeline-gantt-date-brand-7027.test.tsx`, and the
 * reachability argument is unchanged: JSON cannot spell a proxy.
 *
 * Pinned by `./__tests__/timeline-gantt-malformed-row-7164.test.tsx`, which
 * re-runs the card's THREW table (now REFUSED, each naming its path) with the
 * five drawing controls unchanged.

/**
 * "Is this value a `Date`?" — asked so that NOTHING the authored document
 * controls can answer it, and so that asking cannot throw (objectui#7027).
 *
 * ## What was wrong with `instanceof Date`
 *
 * It is this repo's idiom for the question (see
 * `packages/core/src/validation/validation-engine.ts` and
 * `components/src/renderers/complex/data-table.tsx`), and it answers a
 * DIFFERENT question: "does this inherit from `Date.prototype`?". A `Date` is
 * a Date because it owns a `[[DateValue]]` internal slot; the prototype chain
 * is decoration, and the two come apart in both directions. Measured on this
 * card's base 7fc5c3c12 with a node probe:
 *
 *     Object.create(Date.prototype) instanceof Date        -> true
 *     new Date(Object.create(Date.prototype))              -> THREW TypeError:
 *         Method Date.prototype.toString called on incompatible receiver
 *         [object Object]
 *
 * `new Date(x)` uses the slot directly when `x` owns one and runs ToPrimitive
 * when it does not — so an impostor that passed the gate reached `new Date`,
 * reached `Date.prototype[Symbol.toPrimitive]`, reached
 * `Date.prototype.toString` on a receiver with no slot, and took the render
 * down with it. That is a blank screen where a named diagnostic belongs, which
 * is the exact failure mode #6781 put the type gate here to remove and #6907
 * removed one function downstream.
 *
 * `instanceof` is not even total on its own terms: it walks
 * `[[GetPrototypeOf]]`, so a `Proxy` with a throwing `getPrototypeOf` trap
 * crashes inside the operator (measured, same probe).
 *
 * ## Why NOT the two brand tests the card suggested — both measured, both out
 *
 * - `Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Date]'` performs
 *   `Get(O, @@toStringTag)` UNCONDITIONALLY (ES2015 19.1.3.6 step 16), even
 *   once the builtin tag is decided. A `@@toStringTag` getter that throws is
 *   an authored value, and #6907 measured that exact input crashing the
 *   speller. It trades an impostor crash for a getter crash.
 * - `Number.isFinite(value.getTime())` calls the AUTHOR'S `getTime`. A
 *   `class X extends Date` that overrides it is a REAL Date — `super()` gave
 *   it the slot, so #6781's accept set contains it and the chart must draw —
 *   and this spelling would refuse it by dying. It trades an impostor crash
 *   for a subclass crash, on a value that is not even wrong.
 *
 * Both are pinned as red rows in `timeline-gantt-date-brand-7027.test.tsx`,
 * so a later "simplification" into either one fails there rather than in a
 * fifth card.
 *
 * ## What this does instead
 *
 * Invokes the BUILTIN `Date.prototype.getTime` with `.call`. It reads the
 * receiver's `[[DateValue]]` slot and nothing else: no property is fetched off
 * `value`, so no author getter runs, no `@@toStringTag` is consulted, no proxy
 * trap fires, and a subclass cannot hijack it. The slot is not observable any
 * other way — the language exposes that bit only by throwing when it is
 * absent — so the `catch` is the READ, not error handling draped over a
 * fallible operation.
 *
 * `new Date(NaN)` owns its slot, so it is a `Date` here and is refused one
 * step later by the parse check, keeping its `Invalid Date` spelling. That is
 * the half of #6781's ruling this must not move.

/**
 * How a gantt date value is SPELLED inside a diagnostic (objectui#6759,
 * ruled into a rule by objectui#6907).
 *
 * ## THE RULE
 *
 *     Spell the value when the LANGUAGE owns its spelling.
 *     Name its TYPE when producing text would run AUTHOR code.
 *
 * That single line decides every branch below, and it is a rule rather than a
 * list of values someone tripped over — the same treatment #6781 gave the
 * accept set. Every primitive has a spelling fixed by the grammar, so a
 * primitive is spelled: it is literally the text the author typed, and it
 * cannot be confused with the spelling of a different value. A non-primitive
 * has no such spelling. The only way to get text out of one is to call
 * `toString` / `Symbol.toPrimitive` / `Symbol.toStringTag`, all of which are
 * whatever the authored document happens to carry — so the diagnostic would be
 * quoting the very data it is refusing, as if it were trustworthy.
 *
 * ## Why the old `String` fallback had to go — three faults, all measured
 *
 * The fallback was written by #6759 when nothing but `[object Object]`-shaped
 * values could reach it. #6905 (the #6781 type rule) routes the whole
 * non-date type space through it. Measured on this card's base b458300ca, one
 * row item and a throwaway probe (`startDate: '2024-01-01'`, `endDate` varied):
 *
 *     endDate: []                 -> "endDate is , which is not a valid date"
 *     endDate: ['2024-01-01']     -> "endDate is 2024-01-01, ..."
 *     endDate: [0]                -> "endDate is 0, ..."
 *     endDate: 0n                 -> "endDate is 0, ..."
 *     endDate: {toString: () => '2024-01-01'}
 *                                 -> "endDate is 2024-01-01, ..."
 *     endDate: new Map()          -> "endDate is [object Map], ..."
 *     endDate: function myFn() {} -> the function's SOURCE TEXT, newlines and all
 *     endDate: {toString() { throw }}      -> THREW, uncaught, mid-render
 *     endDate: {get [Symbol.toStringTag]() { throw }}
 *                                          -> THREW, uncaught, mid-render
 *     endDate: Object.create(null)         -> THREW TypeError: Cannot convert
 *                                             object to primitive value
 *
 * 1. It VANISHES. `String([])` is the empty string, so the value disappears
 *    from its own sentence — the exact blur this helper quotes strings to
 *    avoid, reached through a different branch.
 * 2. It LIES. `['2024-01-01']` is spelled as a text that IS a valid date, and
 *    `[0]` / `0n` as a number that IS an accepted one (`0` is a kept gantt
 *    date, #6781). The author is told a correct-looking value is invalid with
 *    no hint that the wrapper is the fault.
 * 3. It THROWS. The last three rows are live crashes on `main`, and they are
 *    the reason this is not a cosmetic card. #6759 declared this helper "total
 *    by construction" and #6905 made that property load-bearing by putting the
 *    type gate BEFORE `new Date`. But the gate only stopped `new Date` from
 *    throwing; `String(value)` still handed control to author code one line
 *    later, so the crash class did not go away — it moved from
 *    `findUnusableGanttDate` into this function. A helper that dies while
 *    reporting an author error replaces a named diagnostic with a blank screen,
 *    which is the failure mode both cards exist to remove.
 *
 * ## Why NOT `JSON.stringify`, the obvious repair
 *
 * `JSON.stringify(0n)` THROWS (`TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a
 * BigInt`), and it throws again on a cycle, and it drops `undefined` members.
 * It would reintroduce fault 3 — the crash class — into the one helper that
 * must not have it. Measured, not assumed. It stays only where it is already
 * total: on a `string`, where it is #6759's quoting and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Why NOT "type plus a bounded rendering"
 *
 * The rule refuses it, on the same ground as the rest: any rendering of a
 * non-primitive reads something off it. Even the most bounded version — an
 * element count — is not total, because `Array.isArray` is true for a Proxy
 * whose `length` trap throws (measured). A hybrid would buy a few characters of
 * detail by giving back the crash-freedom the whole card is about.
 *
 * ## Why naming the TYPE does not abandon this helper's purpose
 *
 * The purpose is to let an author find and fix the value. The PATH half does
 * the finding and is always exact (`items[0].items[0].endDate`); the value half
 * exists to disambiguate what sits there when the author cannot see it — `''`
 * from `'  '` from a key never written. For a non-primitive, the author can
 * read their own document at that path; what they cannot read is WHY it was
 * refused. "is an array" says exactly that, and says it about the wrapper,
 * which is the repair. Naming a WRONG value, as the fallback did, is strictly
 * worse than naming a category: it costs the author a search for a fault that
 * is not there.
 *
 * ## The branches, and how far each one's totality reaches
 *
 * - `string` -> quoted (#6759's pin; empty and space-padded stay visible).
 * - `undefined` / `null` -> themselves (#6759 / #6770's pins; how an author
 *   reads a key they forgot to write versus one they wrote as empty).
 * - `symbol` -> `Symbol(desc)` via `Symbol.prototype.toString`, which no
 *   instance can override. `String(aSymbol)` THROWS; #6905's type-first
 *   ordering is what finally made this branch reachable.
 * - `bigint` -> the LITERAL, with its `n`. `String(0n)` is `"0"`, which is
 *   fault 2; `${value}n` is what the author typed and is unmistakable.
 * - `number` / `boolean` -> `String`, which for a primitive IS the source
 *   syntax (`0`, `NaN`, `false`).
 * - `Date` -> `Date.prototype.toString.call`, NOT `String`. Byte-identical for
 *   every Date that owns a `[[DateValue]]` slot (measured, both the valid and
 *   the `Invalid Date` reading), so the inverted-range diagnostic this helper
 *   is shared with does not move. It is used in place of `String` because a
 *   `class X extends Date` that overrides `toString` can hijack `String` and
 *   throw (measured) — the builtin cannot be. This is the one non-primitive
 *   with a spelling the LANGUAGE owns, and it is also the only non-primitive
 *   the accept set contains. The branch is SELECTED by `isDate` and not by
 *   `instanceof Date` (objectui#7027): the builtin `toString` throws on a
 *   receiver that inherits `Date.prototype` without owning the slot, so
 *   choosing this branch on the prototype chain is what let an impostor crash
 *   the very sentence that was supposed to name it.
 * - everything else -> `an array` / `a function` / `an object`, chosen with
 *   `Array.isArray` and `typeof`, which read no author-controlled property.
 *   Deliberately NOT `Object.prototype.toString.call`: that consults
 *   `Symbol.toStringTag`, which can be a throwing getter (measured), so the
 *   more informative spelling is the non-total one. `Array.isArray` reads no
 *   property and is STILL not total — on a revoked `Proxy` it throws. That is
 *   the one exclusion this docblock claims, and it is stated and exercised
 *   rather than repaired: see the objectui#7036 note below.
 *
 * All eight `typeof` results are covered and no branch falls through to author
 * code. The single reflective operation it performs is the Date test, which is
 * the one `isGanttDateType` already performed on the same value to refuse it —
 * so this function adds no throw site the accept gate does not already have.
 *
 * ⚠️ objectui#7027 — that sentence was true and the helper was still not
 * total, because the shared test was `instanceof Date` and `instanceof` is not
 * total. `Object.create(Date.prototype)` took this function's `Date` branch
 * and threw inside `Date.prototype.toString.call`; a `Proxy` with a throwing
 * `getPrototypeOf` trap threw inside the operator itself (both measured on
 * 7fc5c3c12). Both sites now ask `isDate`, which is total, so the shared
 * operation adds no throw site because it HAS none — not because the gate
 * absorbed it first.
 *
 * ⚠️ objectui#7036 — READ THE TWO PARAGRAPHS ABOVE AS A SEQUENCE, NOT AS A
 * CONCLUSION. Each was written as the settled answer and the next card's
 * measurement moved it (#6759 -> #6905 -> #6907 -> #7027). This is the fifth
 * entry and it is deliberately NOT a fifth claim of totality. The sentence it
 * falsifies is the one directly above the #7027 note: this function DOES add
 * a throw site the accept gate does not have, and it is `Array.isArray`.
 *
 * THE EXCLUSION, measured in-render on dd35800af through `TimelineRenderer`
 * itself — not a replica of these branch bodies:
 *
 *     endDate: <a revoked Proxy, over any target>
 *         -> THREW TypeError: Cannot perform 'IsArray' on a proxy that has
 *            been revoked                     (here, at `Array.isArray`)
 *
 * `IsArray` recurses into `[[ProxyTarget]]`, which a revoked proxy does not
 * have, so this throws on an INTERNAL condition while still reading no
 * author-controlled property. All four target shapes throw (`{}`, `[]`, a
 * function, a real `Date`), and so does a revoked proxy pinned as
 * `schema.minDate` / `maxDate`. `typeof` does not separate it out — it
 * answers `'object'` (or `'function'`) without throwing.
 *
 * WHY IT IS LEFT, and none of the three reasons is cost:
 *
 * 1. It is not reachable from an authored document — ObjectUI metadata is
 *    JSON and JSON cannot spell a proxy. Re-swept on dd35800af: zero
 *    `Proxy.revocable` in the repo, zero `Object.setPrototypeOf` calls in
 *    any package `src/`, each read beside a live control on the same
 *    instrument
 *    (52 `Proxy` mentions, 19 `Object.assign` calls) so the zeros are
 *    readings and not a broken query. The `__proto__` hits are denylists.
 * 2. A `catch` here would be SUBSTITUTION, not a read — the opposite of
 *    `isDate`'s. `isDate` catches because the language exposes the
 *    `[[DateValue]]` bit ONLY by throwing, so its catch IS the read. A
 *    revoked proxy has no array-ness to read, so catching would discard a
 *    failure and substitute `an object`: consumer-side tolerance, which is
 *    what #6750 and #6759 both refused. A second `catch` beside `isDate`'s
 *    would erase the distinction this file is built on.
 * 3. It would buy no invariant, because of the paragraph below.
 *
 * ⛔ `Array.isArray` IS NOT THE LAST NON-TOTAL OPERATION ON THE GANTT DATE
 * PATH, and this function cannot make the path total. The true and much
 * narrower sentence is that `Array.isArray` is the last non-total operation
 * INSIDE THIS FUNCTION. Everything upstream of it — the property reads that
 * FETCH the date out of the authored document — is enumerated on
 * `findUnusableGanttDate` and on `calculateDateRange`, which is where a reader
 * asking "how far does this go?" should go next.
 *
 * ⚠️ objectui#7153 — TWO CORRECTIONS to the paragraph that used to stand here,
 * both of them measurements, and the second one matters much more than the
 * first.
 *
 * It said FIVE upstream crash sites. Driven in render on `51449a043` the count
 * is NINE: six in `findUnusableGanttDate` (its `items.length`, `items[i]`,
 * `items[i]?.items`, `rowItems.length`, `rowItems[j]` and `rowItems[j]?.[key]`)
 * and three in `calculateDateRange`. A tenth is identified by reading and
 * recorded as NOT MEASURED. Five was written after a real measurement, and it
 * was short — which is the fifth time prose on this path has been.
 *
 * It also said the upstream sites "are the same reachability class (JSON
 * spells neither a getter nor a proxy)". That is TRUE of the six and FALSE of
 * the three. `calculateDateRange` reads the same walk BARE — `items.flatMap`
 * and `row.items` with no optional chaining — so an authored `items: [null]`,
 * or a row whose `items` is a truthy non-array, crashes the render from
 * ordinary JSON that the declared zod mirror accepts. That is a live defect,
 * objectui#7164, not an excluded exotic. The exclusion argument this docblock
 * makes for its own `Array.isArray` covers the six and must not be borrowed
 * for the three.
 *
 * ⚠️ Whatever totality this docblock claims is bounded by an EXERCISED input
 * set — the rows in `__tests__/timeline-gantt-date-brand-7027.test.tsx`,
 * which now include the revoked proxy — and by nothing else. On this path
 * prose has been a hypothesis four times running.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It does not change WHICH values are refused — that is #6781's ruling and it
 * is untouched here — and it does not change the sentence. "is an array, which
 * is not a valid date" reads correctly in the existing
 * `timeline.gantt.unusableRange.malformedDate` hole, so no new i18n key is
 * added and the ten locale packs are not opened. A spelling repair that needed
 * a new key would be a different file surface and a separate decision.
 *
 * (objectui#7164 later took that decision for a DIFFERENT fault — a malformed
 * ROW, not a date spelling — and opened the packs for `malformedRow`. This
 * function's spelling fills that key's `{{value}}` hole as well, for the same
 * reason it fills `malformedDate`'s: a value is named, never rendered, and no
 * author code runs. See `classifyGanttRows`.)

/**
 * The first gantt date that does not parse — objectui#6759 case 1.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * objectui#6750 taught `calculateDateRange` about the EMPTY list and nothing
 * else. A list whose dates do not PARSE reduced exactly as before:
 * `new Date('not-a-date').getTime()` is `NaN`, `Math.min(NaN)` is `NaN`, and
 * `new Date(NaN).toISOString()` throws `RangeError: Invalid time value`
 * mid-render — the same crash site and the same signature as #6750, on a
 * different input class. Measured on this card's base b98352a15, with a
 * throwaway probe before any change:
 *
 *     CASE-1  malformed startDate + endDate -> RangeError: Invalid time value
 *     CASE-1b one date parses, one does not -> RangeError: Invalid time value
 *     CASE-1c endDate absent entirely       -> RangeError: Invalid time value
 *
 * 1c is the one worth reading twice. `new Date(undefined)` is also an invalid
 * date, so a row item that simply OMITS `endDate` crashed the render too — it
 * arrives at the same reduce through the same `[item.startDate, item.endDate]`
 * flatMap. It is not a separate defect and it is not a widening: any guard
 * phrased as "every date in the list must parse" necessarily covers it, and
 * deliberately excluding it would mean writing extra code to keep one input
 * class crashing.
 *
 * ## Why the PINS are scanned here too
 *
 * `schema.minDate` / `schema.maxDate` never reach `calculateDateRange` — the
 * caller resolves `schema.minDate || dateRange.minDate` afterwards — so an
 * author who pins an unparseable value does not crash. They fail the OTHER
 * way, which is worse and is case 2's disease: measured on the same base,
 * `minDate: 'whenever'` rendered an axis with zero columns and a bar carrying
 * NO `style` attribute at all (`CASE-2b ... bars: [null]`), because
 * `calculateBarDimensions` divided by `NaN` and the CSSOM rejects
 * `left: NaN%`. One scan covers both origins because they are one question:
 * does every date this chart is about to be drawn from parse?
 *
 * Only a TRUTHY pin is judged. `schema.minDate: ''` is falsy, so the caller's
 * `||` discards it and the computed range is used instead; judging a value the
 * render will never read would refuse a chart that draws correctly. `null` is
 * falsy as well, so a PINNED `null` stays unjudged for that same reason even
 * though a ROW `null` is refused below (objectui#6770) — measured: `minDate:
 * null, maxDate: null` draws the rows' own range, `['Jan 2024','Feb 2024','Mar
 * 2024']`. The asymmetry is the caller's `||`, which row dates have nothing
 * equivalent to.
 *
 * Rows before pins, which is the order the caller resolves them in — compute
 * from the rows, then let a pin override. When both are wrong the diagnostic
 * names the one a reader tracing the render reaches first.
 *
 * ## `null` is a fault too — the one that PARSES (objectui#6770)
 *
 * `new Date(null).getTime()` is `0`, not `NaN` — the epoch, not an invalid
 * date — so a `null` date passes every parse check there is and flows into the
 * arithmetic as `1970-01-01`. #6759 left it alone as an input class it had not
 * measured; #6770 measured it, on c6732825d, i.e. WITH the guard above already
 * in the tree, one row item and a throwaway probe:
 *
 *     CASE-NULL-END   endDate: null   -> alert: null, axis 649 columns
 *                     (Jan 1970 … Jan 2024), bars ["left: 100%; width: -100%;"]
 *     CASE-NULL-START startDate: null -> alert: null, axis 651 columns,
 *                     bars ["left: 0%; width: 100%;"]
 *     CASE-NULL-BOTH  both null       -> alert: null, axis ["Jan 1970"],
 *                     bars ["left: 0%; width: 100%;"]
 *
 * The last two are the reason this is refused rather than drawn: they do not
 * even look broken. A full-width bar under a one-bucket `Jan 1970` axis is a
 * chart a reader believes.
 *
 * ## Why refused, rather than read as "open-ended" or as "absent"
 *
 * Not a new adjudication: #6759 already refuses an ABSENT date — `new
 * Date(undefined)` is `NaN` — and pins it ("an ABSENT date is the same input
 * class and is named as `undefined`"). `null` is that same absence with a
 * different spelling: a record mapping that omits the key and one that emits
 * `null` report the same unset field upstream. Treating them differently would
 * make the chart depend on how a mapping layer spells "no value" — something
 * no author writes and none can predict. The two other readings both fail the
 * same test: "runs to the end of the axis" is a new rendering behaviour that
 * would need a spec key of its own rather than a meaning smuggled into `null`,
 * and "fall back to `startDate`" substitutes a plausible value for one the
 * document does not carry — the consumer-side tolerance #6750 and #6759 both
 * rejected. `spellGanttDateValue` was already written to spell `null` as
 * itself, for "one they wrote as empty"; until this card that branch could not
 * be reached.
 *
 * ## Where the line is: the RULED TYPE RULE (objectui#6781)
 *
 * #6770 drew this line at `value === null` and deliberately nothing wider,
 * because it had measured only that one spelling. objectui#6781 measured the
 * rest of the type space and the maintainer ruled the line to be a TYPE rule
 * instead — see `isGanttDateType` below, which is now the whole of "is this a
 * date at all". `null` is no longer named on its own; it is refused by that
 * rule, through this same function, with the same path and the same spelling
 * (measured — see the table on `isGanttDateType`).
 *
 * `0` stays ACCEPTED under that rule, which is the part worth reading twice.
 * `0` coerces to the epoch just like `null` did (measured: the same 649-column
 * axis) — but `0` is a legitimate epoch timestamp, indistinguishable from an
 * author who means 1970-01-01, and `startDate: 1704067200000` renders 2024
 * correctly today. `null` is not a timestamp at all; it is what a data source
 * hands you for a field that is unset. The type rule keeps exactly that
 * distinction and widens nothing around it.
 */
/**
 * THE RULED TYPE RULE for a gantt date — objectui#6781, maintainer ruling
 * 2026-08-30 (option A of that card's three).
 *
 * ## The accept set, stated as an accept set
 *
 *     string  |  FINITE number  |  Date
 *
 * and nothing else. This is a RULE, not a list of values someone tripped over:
 * every input class is judged by the same question — "is this the kind of thing
 * a date can be written as?" — and the answer does not depend on which
 * coercion `new Date` happens to perform on it. The three cards before this one
 * each added one more refused VALUE (`undefined` #6759, `null` #6770); this one
 * replaces that accretion with the rule they were each approximating, so the
 * next exotic value does not need a fourth card.
 *
 * ## Why a type rule rather than more values
 *
 * `new Date(x)` accepts far more than dates. It runs ToPrimitive on anything,
 * so a boolean, an array, or any object with a plausible `toString` becomes an
 * instant, silently. Measured on this card's base fab4802e3, one row item and a
 * throwaway probe (`endDate` set, `startDate: '2024-01-01'`):
 *
 *     endDate: false            -> NO diagnostic, axis 649 columns
 *                                  (Jan 1970 … Jan 2024), bars ["left: 100%;
 *                                  width: -100%;"]
 *     endDate: true             -> NO diagnostic, axis 649 columns, bars
 *                                  ["left: 100%; width: -99.99999999994131%;"]
 *     endDate: ['2024-01-01']   -> NO diagnostic, axis ["Jan 2024"], bars
 *                                  ["left: 0%; width: 100%;"]
 *     endDate: [0]              -> NO diagnostic (ToPrimitive gives "0", which
 *                                  parses as the year 2000)
 *     endDate: {toString: () => '2024-01-01'}
 *                               -> NO diagnostic, axis ["Jan 2024"]
 *
 * The first is the filed shape of this defect and is byte-identical to the
 * `endDate: 0` reading the card was filed on: a fifty-four-year axis and a
 * NEGATIVE-width bar, with no diagnostic. `false` is where a wrong value hides:
 * a boolean reaching a date field means a mapping layer emitted the wrong
 * column, and drawing a 1970 axis from it is the silent-wrong-render this
 * chart's three previous cards each closed one spelling of.
 *
 * ## Why `0` is KEPT (the ruling is explicit, and it is the load-bearing half)
 *
 * `0` is a finite number, so it is ACCEPTED and still draws 1970-01-01. That is
 * ruled, not incidental: `0` is a legitimate epoch timestamp, and under a
 * `startDate: 1704067200000` encoding an author who writes `0` means the epoch.
 * Refusing it would take away a real capability to catch a hypothetical input.
 * Measured for this card: the repo has ZERO sites feeding an integer `0` into a
 * gantt date (control: 222 gantt-date assignment sites repo-wide), so the
 * capability is preserved on the encoding's terms rather than on a consumer's —
 * which is why the pin for it is a TEST and not a call site.
 *
 * ## Why FINITE, when `new Date` already refuses `NaN` and `Infinity`
 *
 * It moves nothing measured: `new Date(NaN)` and `new Date(Infinity)` are both
 * invalid dates, so the parse check below already refused them and still would.
 * The clause is here so the accept set can be READ as the rule it is — "a
 * number that is an instant" — instead of leaving the exclusion to a coercion
 * detail that a later reader would have to rediscover. Same verdict, stated
 * rather than inherited.
 *
 * ## `null` and `undefined` are SUBSUMED, and their diagnostics do not move
 *
 * Neither is a string, a finite number, or a `Date`, so both are refused here
 * — #6759's `undefined` and #6770's `null` alike — and neither is named
 * separately any more. This is strictly wider than `value === null` and it
 * changes nothing an author sees: the path is the same, and
 * `spellGanttDateValue` still spells them as themselves. The reasoning that put
 * them here is preserved in this function's header, which is where a reader
 * asking "why is an absent date refused?" goes.
 *
 * ## The order is load-bearing: this gate runs BEFORE `new Date`
 *
 * `new Date(x)` does not merely refuse a `bigint` or a `symbol` — it THROWS
 * `TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number`. Measured on the same
 * base, both crashed the render from inside the guard itself:
 *
 *     endDate: 0n         -> THREW TypeError (uncaught, mid-render)
 *     endDate: Symbol('s') -> THREW TypeError (uncaught, mid-render)
 *
 * A guard that crashes while reporting an author error replaces a named
 * diagnostic with a blank screen — the exact failure mode `spellGanttDateValue`
 * calls out one docblock up, and the reason its `symbol` branch was written
 * "total by construction". Refusing by TYPE first makes this predicate total:
 * `new Date` is only ever reached with a string, a finite number, or a `Date`,
 * none of which throw. Those two classes now take the ordinary refusal path,
 * and that `symbol` branch is reachable at last.
 *
 * ⚠️ ...with ONE gap, closed by objectui#7027 and worth reading as the reason
 * this docblock now points at `isDate`. The paragraph above is a claim about
 * `new Date`'s ARGUMENT, and it was only as good as the predicate that
 * produced it. `instanceof Date` answers "does this inherit from
 * `Date.prototype`?", not "is this a `Date`?", so it admitted
 * `Object.create(Date.prototype)` — which is not a `Date`, reached `new Date`,
 * and threw. Measured on 7fc5c3c12; the reading and the two other impostor
 * spellings are on `isDate` above and pinned in
 * `timeline-gantt-date-brand-7027.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ⛔ That is the fourth totality claim in this code path and the third to be
 * falsified by the next card's measurement (#6759 -> #6905 -> #6907 -> this).
 * The pattern is the lesson: totality asserted in prose is a hypothesis, and
 * the only thing that has ever settled it here is an exercised input set. Do
 * not answer a future gap with a fifth sentence — add the row to that file.
 *
 * The ACCEPT SET is untouched by #7027. `isDate` is strictly narrower than
 * `instanceof Date` over values that reach it, and everything it newly refuses
 * is a value no authored document can carry (ObjectUI metadata is JSON; JSON
 * has no way to spell a prototype). An invalid `Date` object owns its slot, so
 * it still passes this gate and is still refused by the parse check below,
 * where it belongs, with its `Invalid Date` spelling intact.

/**
 * WHAT THE ROW WALK BELOW READS, AND WHERE THAT READING IS NOT TOTAL —
 * objectui#7153, the enumeration objectui#7036's docblock pointed at.
 *
 * ## Read this as a BOUNDED READING, not as a totality claim
 *
 * Five cards before this one made a totality claim about this code path
 * (#6759 -> #6905 -> #6907 -> #7027 -> #7036) and FOUR were falsified by the
 * next card's measurement. #7153 is the fourth falsification: it measured that
 * `spellGanttDateValue`'s `Array.isArray` is not "the last non-total operation
 * on the gantt date path", only the last one inside that function.
 *
 * So this block does not say the walk is total, and it does not say the list
 * below is complete. It says: these are the operations that were DRIVEN, in
 * render, through `TimelineRenderer` on `51449a043`, and this is what each one
 * did. Everything outside that input set is unmeasured, which is a third thing
 * and not a quiet green.
 *
 * ## THE SITES, each with the input that drove it and the frame it threw from
 *
 * `?.` guards `null` and `undefined`. It does not guard a getter that throws
 * or a revoked `Proxy`: those crash INSIDE the read, before any value exists
 * to judge, so the type gate above never sees them.
 *

 *
 * SIX here, and THREE more in `calculateDateRange` (see that function). NINE
 * measured, where #7153's card said five and #7036's docblock repeated it. The
 * count was never the point, but it is the evidence that prose counting on
 * this path is a hypothesis: both numbers were written after a real
 * measurement, and both were short.
 *
 * ⚠️ objectui#7164 MOVED U1–U3 out of this function: `items.length`,
 * `items[rowIndex]` and `row.items` are now read ONCE, in `classifyGanttRows`,
 * and this walk iterates the `GanttRow[]` that function built. The trap
 * messages pinned for U1–U3 are unchanged (the trap writes them), U4–U6 still
 * fire here on the authored `row.items` array, and `Array.isArray` in
 * `classifyGanttRows` is a NEW site where a revoked proxy dies (`IsArray`
 * rather than `get`) — see that function, and the re-attributed rows in pin 5.
 * The three in `calculateDateRange` are REPAIRED, not moved: see class 2 below.
 *
 * A tenth read — `item.startDate` / `item.endDate` inside
 * `calculateDateRange`'s inner `flatMap` — is bare and would throw on a `null`
 * item, but it is SHADOWED here: U6's `?.` turns a `null` item into
 * `undefined`, which the type gate refuses, so the render never reaches it.
 * That shadow is an accident of two functions written apart, not a guard, and
 * it is recorded as NOT MEASURED: no input was found that reaches it.
 *
 * ## TWO REACHABILITY CLASSES, and they must not be merged
 *
 * 1. THE SIX ABOVE — unreachable from an authored document. ObjectUI metadata
 *    is JSON and JSON spells neither a getter nor a proxy. Re-swept on
 *    `51449a043` with the comment-stripped instrument, each zero beside a live
 *    control on that same instrument: across every package `src/` excluding
 *    tests, `Proxy.revocable` 0, `new Proxy` 0, the bare word `Proxy` 0, and
 *    `Object.setPrototypeOf` 0 — against `Object.assign` 19 and `JSON.parse`
 *    105. Widened to the whole repo the SAME query returns `Proxy.revocable`
 *    1, `new Proxy` 21 and `Proxy` 105 (all in tests, one of them this file's
 *    own factory), which is what makes the narrow zeros readings rather than a
 *    broken query.
 *
 * 2. `calculateDateRange`'s THREE — ordinary JSON, and a live defect until
 *    objectui#7164 REPAIRED it: `classifyGanttRows` now refuses `items` that is
 *    not an array, a `null` row and a truthy non-array `row.items` through
 *    `timeline.gantt.unusableRange.malformedRow`, and every reader below it
 *    consumes that verdict. They were never this class and never p3, and the
 *    repair does not change that: the sentence "JSON cannot spell this" is
 *    true of the six and was false of the three, and collapsing the two is how
 *    this docblock would start overclaiming again.
 *
 * ## WHY A `catch` IS NOT PUT HERE — re-tested, not inherited from #7036
 *
 * #7036 refused a `catch` at the speller because it would SUBSTITUTE `an
 * object` for a failure rather than read anything, the opposite of `isDate`'s
 * `catch` (which IS the read, because the language exposes `[[DateValue]]`
 * only by throwing). #7153's dispatch required that argument to be re-tested
 * upstream rather than assumed, because upstream is not the same shape. It was
 * tested, by ablation, and it comes out DIFFERENTLY — in half:
 *
 * A `try` around U6 alone, reporting the path built from the loop counters,
 * was measured in-render. The PATH half is a genuine READ: the throwing-getter
 * input came back NAMED as `items[0].items[0].endDate`, exact, including the
 * key whose getter threw — because the path is built from `rowIndex`,
 * `itemIndex` and `key` and never touches the value. The speller's `catch` has
 * no such thing; it holds only the value it cannot read.
 *
 * The VALUE half is still substitution. The measured diagnostic read `...
 * endDate is "UNREADABLE", which is not a valid date` — a placeholder standing
 * in the `{value}` hole of `timeline.gantt.unusableRange.malformedDate`. There
 * is no true spelling for a value that cannot be touched, so a real repair
 * needs a value-less diagnostic, which is a new i18n key across ten locale
 * packs: the file surface #7036 deferred as a separate decision.
 *
 * And the coverage is the same shape of error #7036's triage caught. That
 * `catch` converted THREE of the nine measured sites (U5, U6, and the
 * throwing-getter item) and left the other six throwing — U1 through U4 are
 * upstream of it, and `calculateDateRange`'s three are downstream. The PASSING
 * control held either way: an ordinary row drew 1 bar over a 3-cell axis
 * before and after. One `catch` here would buy 3 of 9 while a docblock went on
 * implying the walk was safe, which is exactly the "1 of 6" trade #7036 was
 * stopped from making.
 *
 * ## So this is STATED AND EXERCISED, on #7036's terms
 *
 * The rows are in `./__tests__/timeline-gantt-date-brand-7027.test.tsx`, pin
 * 5, asserting each throw's own MESSAGE so the pin fails if a site MOVES as
 * well as if it is repaired — a bare `toThrow()` would stay green through
 * exactly the relocation this path has performed four times.

       * that made it unusable.
       *
       * ## The policy, and why it is not a new adjudication
       *
       * Two defects arrived together because a fixer has to decide ONE policy
       * for both, and they failed in OPPOSITE directions, which is itself the
       * evidence that no policy existed yet: a malformed date crashed the
       * render (`RangeError: Invalid time value`), while an inverted
       * author-pinned range drew a bar at `left: 157.9%; width: -4.3%` under a
       * header row with zero cells and said nothing. The 2026-08-29 triage
       * ruled both are ordinary defects rather than policy questions, and that
       * the WORDING — the only genuinely open question — already has a
       * precedent one file away: objectui#6655 refuses the object-bound gantt
       * with a `role="alert"` diagnostic. So this is that neighbour's shape,
       * copied rather than invented.
       *
       * ## Why HERE — above everything except the row verdict
       *
       * Placed after `classifyGanttRows` (objectui#7164: a row has to BE a row
       * before its dates can be asked to parse, and `rows` is the only shape
       * this scan reads), before `calculateDateRange` and before
       * `generateTimeScaleHeaders`, and it establishes an invariant for both:
       * every date reaching them parses, and the resolved range is not
       * inverted. That matters most for `generateTimeScaleHeaders`, whose own
       * guard already refuses an unparseable or inverted range by returning NO
       * headers — the zero-column axis case 2 rendered under. That guard is
       * pinned by objectui#6750 as "a different input class, left exactly as it
       * was", and it stays untouched: it is now simply unreachable from this
       * branch, rather than being widened or relaxed. Downstream,
       * `calculateBarDimensions` can no longer see a `NaN` or negative
       * `totalDuration` at all, so #6750's `totalDuration === 0` guard keeps
       * covering exactly the degenerate case it was written for.
       *
       * ## What this deliberately does NOT do
       *
       * It does not widen #6750's `emptyGanttDateRange` sentinel to absorb
       * these. The card and its triage both rejected that path for the same
       * reason: substituting a plausible range for a value the author got wrong
       * is consumer-side tolerance, and hiding an author error behind a
       * believable render is precisely case 2's disease. An EMPTY list stays an
       * ordinary state with a sentinel; an UNPARSEABLE value is refused.

// Both registrations name the same short key. Until this flag existed, both also
// claimed the bare fallback (`Registry.register`, the `meta?.namespace &&
// !meta?.skipFallback` branch), so which renderer answered `type: 'timeline'` was
// decided by which module evaluated LAST — `./index` re-exports this module at its
// line 300, before its own `import` at 307, so this file registered first and was
// then overwritten. The outcome was right and the mechanism was not: swapping those

// reads none of the object-bound keys, so an authored timeline would stop fetching
// with no error. The registry's own collision guard names this remedy in its warning.
