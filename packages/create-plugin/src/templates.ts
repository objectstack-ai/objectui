/**
 * devDependencies written into the generated plugin.
 *
 * EVERY entry is SOURCED, not invented — each copies this monorepo's own range

 * rather than one per file. These literals sit in `.ts` source, outside the
 * objectui#3711 version-claims gate's scan face, so `templates.test.ts` pins
 * the parity instead — and it pins the WHOLE map, not a subset, which is what
 * stops a re-anchored entry from silently rotting again (objectui#3742).
 *
 * Two anchors, because not every build dependency exists in the root manifest.
 * `create-plugin` writes into `<cwd>/packages/plugin-<name>`, so a generated
 * plugin is a literal sibling of `packages/plugin-*` — those manifests are the
 * faithful anchor for anything the root does not declare:
 *
 * | dependency                  | range     | anchor                                     |
 * | --------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
 * | `@testing-library/jest-dom` | `^7.0.1`  | repo root package.json (also apps/console) |
 * | `@testing-library/react`    | `^16.3.2` | repo root package.json (also apps/console) |
 * | `@vitejs/plugin-react`      | `^6.0.5`  | every `packages/plugin-*` (not in root)    |
 * | `jsdom`                     | `^30.0.1` | repo root package.json                     |
 * | `typescript`                | `^6.0.3`  | repo root package.json                     |
 * | `vite`                      | `^8.2.1`  | repo root package.json                     |
 * | `vite-plugin-dts`           | `^5.0.3`  | every `packages/plugin-*` (not in root)    |

 * `@testing-library/dom` is deliberately absent: it is a peer of
 * `@testing-library/react` 16 and is installed by the workspace's
 * `auto-install-peers=true`, which is also why `apps/console` declares the
 * same three and not four.
 *
 * The build entries carried pre-anchoring ranges until objectui#3742 — the
 * scaffold handed authors vite 7 / plugin-react 4 / dts 4 / TypeScript 5 while
 * the repo built and tested every in-tree plugin on vite 8 / plugin-react 6 /
 * dts 5 / TypeScript 6. objectui#3716's artifact end-to-end run only ever
 * exercised the in-repo versions, so the declared ranges were never the ones
 * under test. Not a peer conflict: `^4.2.1` resolved to plugin-react 4.7.0,
 * whose vite peer had widened to `^4.2.0 || ^5.0.0 || ^6.0.0 || ^7.0.0` and
 * accepted vite 7 — the cost was a scaffold one to two majors behind its own
 * monorepo, not a failing install.

 * and shares this workspace, so `workspace:*` always resolves to the version the
 * repo currently builds and tests with, and can never drift.
 *
 * A VERSIONED runtime range here can drift, and one did. Until objectui#3755 the

 * source file imported, nailed two majors behind the 23 in-repo declarations
 * (all `^1.28.0`) and unable to float off it, because a `0.x` caret does not
 * cross minors: `^0.563.0` is `>=0.563.0 <0.564.0`. Every scaffolded plugin
 * really installed lucide 0.563.x for code that never referenced it.
 *
 * It is gone rather than re-anchored because this repo declares an icon library
 * where it imports one: of the 24 manifests that mention `lucide-react`, 23
 * import it, and no package pre-declares it for code not yet written. An author
 * who wants icons runs `pnpm add lucide-react` and lands the current version by
 * construction — no anchor table has to be maintained to keep an unused
 * declaration honest. `templates.test.ts` pins both halves: this map is exactly
 * the four `workspace:*` entries, and no versioned runtime range may be
 * declared without a generated source importing it (the reverse of the one-way
 * import gate objectui#3733 added, which only ever caught the other direction).

/**
 * The generated plugin's `vite.config.ts`.
 *
 * The `test` block is load-bearing, not decoration:
 * - `environment: 'jsdom'` — the example test calls `render()`; the Vitest
 *   default (`node`) has no `document` for React to mount into.
 * - `globals: true` — `@testing-library/react` only registers its automatic
 *   `cleanup()` when `afterEach` exists as a GLOBAL (`dist/index.js`:
 *   `if (typeof afterEach === 'function')`). Without it the DOM leaks between
 *   tests, silently, as soon as the author writes a second one.
 * - `setupFiles` — where the jest-dom matchers get registered; see
 *   {@link buildVitestSetup}.
 *
 * The `/// <reference types="vitest/config" />` above the imports is what makes
 * that block TYPE-check, and it is load-bearing too (objectui#8139). `vite`'s
 * own `UserConfig` declares no `test` key, so `defineConfig` imported from
 * `vite` refuses the block with TS2769 ("Object literal may only specify known
 * properties, and 'test' does not exist in type 'UserConfigExport'") — measured
 * by the emitted-code census (objectui#7864 / PR #8138) on this very template.
 * Nothing in the scaffolded repo RUNS that check today (`buildPackageJson`
 * scaffolds `build`/`test`/`lint` and no `tsc`, and `vite build` loads the
 * config through esbuild, which does not type-check), so the symptom is an
 * editor-only red squiggle — but it is red on day one, in every plugin this
 * generator writes. The reference pulls in `vitest/dist/config.d.ts`, whose
 * `declare module "vite" { interface UserConfig { test?: … } }` augmentation is
 * exactly the missing declaration; it is a type-only comment, so it changes
 * nothing at run time and `vite build` never sees it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Do NOT "simplify" this to `import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'`,
 * the other shape vitest documents. It type-checks identically in the scaffolded
 * repo — `vitest ^4.1.10` is a declared devDependency there, see
 * {@link DEV_DEPENDENCIES} — but it makes THIS repo stop measuring the template:
 * `vitest` is declared by this repository's root manifest and by no package the
 * census maps, so an emitted `import … from 'vitest/config'` trips the census's
 * root bound and the whole block is REFUSED instead of judged. Measured both
 * ways on b38014e82: with the reference, `Judged 12 … 7 refused by the root
 * bound` and the TS2769 is gone; with the import, `Judged 11 … 8 refused` and
 * the census reports zero diagnostics here because it no longer compiles this
 * template at all — including the TS2307 below, which it would also stop
 * seeing. A clean number bought by not looking is the one outcome that census
 * was built to avoid.
 *
 * The `import dts from 'vite-plugin-dts'` line still draws a TS2307 from that
 * census. It is an artefact of the instrument, NOT a defect: the scaffolded
 * `package.json` declares `vite-plugin-dts` (see {@link DEV_DEPENDENCIES}), and
 * the census resolves against this monorepo's root manifest, where it is not
 * declared. ⛔ Do not "fix" it here.
 *
 * The entry path is resolved from `import.meta.dirname`, not `__dirname`. Vite
 * still defines `__dirname` under its default `configLoader: 'bundle'`, but
 * vite 8 warns on it ("Your Vite config uses features that are unsupported by
 * `configLoader: 'native'`, which is planned to become the default in a future
 * major version of Vite ... Use `import.meta.dirname` instead"), and under
 * `native` — which imports the config with Node's own ESM loader, where no
 * `__dirname` exists — it would fail outright. `apps/console/vite.config.ts`
 * was converted for the same reason (objectui#3384); the generated config now
 * ships already-correct rather than warning on an author's first `pnpm build`.
 * Safe unconditionally here: the repo requires Node >= 22 and vite defines
 * `import.meta.dirname` under the bundle loader too.
 *
 * Scaffolding INTO this monorepo is a case this output deliberately does NOT
 * serve, and it needs no change here because THIS repo already refuses it
 * loudly (objectui#7524, measured on a9e6f04b4). Running the generator into
 * `packages/` and re-running `pnpm exec vitest run scripts/__tests__/` turns
 * 11 assertions red across 7 files, every one naming the generated package;
 * four are about this shape specifically:
 *
 * - `scripts/__tests__/vitest-invocation-guard.test.ts` — "calls the guard
 *   from every one of them", "declares no `test` block - a build config must
 *   not carry test semantics", and "derives the repo root instead of counting
 *   `..`" (objectui#3240 / objectui#5406);
 * - `scripts/__tests__/runner-package-test-entry-3746.test.ts` — "admits no
 *   package beyond the recorded baseline" (objectui#3746), which reads the
 *   generated `"test": "vitest run"` from {@link buildPackageJson}.
 *
 * Those pins exist because inside this repo a package-cwd `vitest run` picks
 * up a package-local `test` block instead of `vitest.config.mts` and goes
 * green under a config CI never uses. Measured for the scaffold too: the
 * generated `pnpm test` passes with `RUN v4.1.10 .../packages/plugin-NAME` as
 * its root and no guard output at all - which is exactly why the pins, not
 * the reviewer, are what catches it. In this repo a package needing different
 * test semantics declares a PROJECT in `vitest.config.mts`.
 *
 * None of that is true of the audience this generator serves - a plugin in
 * its OWN repo, where the emitted config is the only config and the block
 * below is the only thing giving the example test a DOM. Do not teach these
 * templates to detect an in-repo target: the two answers differ because the
 * questions differ, and the in-repo answer is already enforced above.
