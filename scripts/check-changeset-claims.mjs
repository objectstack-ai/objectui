 *       1 = the inputs could not be read, so this run measured nothing
 *
 * ## The defect (objectui#9003, and objectui#7721 / objectui#8617 / objectui#8759 before it)
 *
 * A `.changeset/*.md` body publishes VERBATIM into the CHANGELOG at the next
 * release. Between authoring and release it sits in the tree as ordinary prose
 * that no gate evaluates and nothing re-reads. Four gates read `.changeset/`
 * — presence, no-major, fixed, overwrite — and all four judge STRUCTURE: that a
 * declaration exists, what level it declares, how the workspace classifies it,
 * whether a change touched one it does not own. None of them reads a claim in a
 * body.
 *
 * Three instances were filed and worked one at a time before the mechanism was
 * carded. They split into two sub-shapes that end the same way:
 *
 *   BORN FALSE  - authored against the merge base while describing the head
 *                 (objectui#8759: a sentence counted two occurrences of a thing
 *                 its own diff made three).
 *   WENT FALSE  - true when written, falsified by a LATER merge
 *                 (objectui#7721, objectui#8617).
 *
 * This gate opened covering WENT FALSE ONLY, and said so in its own output. It
 * now carries a SECOND reading for BORN FALSE (objectui#9509), over a different
 * corpus and on a different coordinate — see "The born-false reading" below.
 * ⛔ The two readings are never merged: the went-false reading still excludes a
 * changeset this change adds, because a body naming its own pull request's files
 * is the normal case and reporting it would fire on nearly every change here.
 *
 * ## The born-false reading (objectui#9509) — corpus, coordinate, carve-out
 *
 * objectui#9509 measured three instances in one day across two pull requests.
 * ⛔ None of them was in a pending changeset, and that is the whole reason this
 * reading needed a corpus of its own:
 *
 *   1. objectui#9496, in its PULL REQUEST BODY: a test frame cited as `:281:75`
 *      that the same branch's later edit moved to `:283:75` — and then to
 *      `:299:75`.
 *   2. objectui#9496, in its PULL REQUEST BODY: "recurs exactly twice: `:223`
 *      ... and `:246`", falsified by the 28-line comment block THE SAME DIFF
 *      inserts at `imported-defaults.ts:221`. At the head `:223` is rewritten and
 *      `:246` is at `:274` — and both numbers then land inside the block that
 *      displaced them, so a reader following the citation reaches prose ABOUT
 *      the claim instead of the code it is about.
 *   3. objectui#9495, in a SOURCE DOCBLOCK: "a grep for `shortcut` finds that
 *      member first", falsified by the same diff's own 28-line insertion above
 *      it. ⛔ Out of reach here and deliberately — see the limits below.
 *
 * CORPUS: the prose this change PUBLISHES ABOUT ITSELF. That is the pull request
 * body (read from `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`, or `--pr-body <file>` locally) plus the
 * `.changeset/*.md` bodies this change adds or modifies. ⛔ Not the tree at
 * large: a citation written into an ordinary source file is the differential
 * citation gate's population (`check-new-cross-file-line-citations.mjs`), and
 * this repository treats a second reader over one population as a defect.
 *
 * COORDINATE: a backticked LINE ADDRESS — `some-file.ts:246`, or a bare `:246`
 * continuing a file named earlier in the same paragraph — resolving to exactly
 * one tracked file THIS CHANGE TOUCHES. Same resolution rule as the went-false
 * reading, and for the same reason: an ambiguous spelling names nothing.
 *
 * The question asked of it is arithmetic, and is still not "is this sentence
 * true?":
 *
 *   MOVED    the file is MODIFIED here, and this change's own hunks map the
 *            cited base line to a different head line, or delete it outright.
 *            The number was read from a tree this diff replaced.
 *   UNANCHORED  the file is ADDED here, so the address can only ever have been
 *            read from a tree that exists nowhere but inside this pull request,
 *            and moves again on the next push. Instance 1 is this shape: the
 *            frame moved twice, between revisions of one branch.
 *
 * CARVE-OUT: an address whose own SENTENCE names the tree it was read from is
 * ⛔ never reported. Both pull requests converged on that form independently and
 * objectui#9509 carded it as the durable one: `` `:246` at `b8a006883d`, `:274`
 * at this head ``. A number bound to a sha cannot re-stale, so a gate that
 * reported it would be teaching authors to unbind. ⚠️ The binding is read per
 * SENTENCE, not per paragraph: a sha floating three sentences away binds
 * nothing, and a paragraph-wide window would have exempted instance 2.
 *
 * ⛔ What the born-false reading does NOT cover, so nobody reads it as more:
 *   - A claim with no line address at all. Instance 3 coordinates itself by
 *     ORDINAL ("finds that member first"), and deciding that requires reading
 *     what the sentence means — the one question triage fenced off, below.
 *   - An address into a file this change does not touch. That address may be
 *     false, but nothing about THIS diff made it so; it is the citation census's
 *     population and not this one's.
 *   - A pull request body EDITED without a push. `pull_request` fires on
 *     `opened`/`synchronize`/`reopened`, so a body rewritten on its own is read
 *     at the next push and not before.
 *
 * ## What it judges, and the one thing it refuses to judge
 *
 * Triage fenced this card: "Do not attempt to judge prose truth automatically.
 * The four gates the card enumerates judge presence, bump level and
 * classification - mechanical properties. 'Is this sentence true?' is not one,
 * and a gate that pretends otherwise will be turned off within a month."
 *
 * So the question asked here is mechanical and has nothing to do with truth:
 *
 *   Does this changeset body NAME, in backticks, a file this change touches?
 *
 * Name resolution, not meaning. A backticked span that looks like a path is
 * resolved against the tree at the base commit, and only an UNAMBIGUOUS
 * resolution counts - exactly one tracked file. `package.json` resolves to 47
 * files in this workspace and therefore names nothing definite; a spelling like
 * `flow-node-config.spec-reconciliation.test.ts` resolves to one. That is the
 * whole filter, and it needs no hand-maintained denylist of common names.
 *
 * The output QUOTES the paragraph, never the line. From objectui#8617's landing:
 * the unit that rots is the paragraph, not the sentence - both false halves of
 * that card sat in one Migration paragraph, and correcting either alone would
 * have left the paragraph asserting the same wrong thing.
 *
 * ## Why the coordinate is a FILE NAME and not a symbol or a package
 *
 * Measured over the 25 most recent first-parent commits on `main`, against the
 * 1,384 changesets pending in the tree, counting how many pre-existing changesets
 * each commit would have been asked to re-read:
 *
 *   coordinate                                            median   mean   max
 *   symbol mentioned anywhere in the diff                    191    ---    309
 *   workspace package the diff changes a file in              25    ---    200
 *   identifier declared in exactly one file the diff edits      8   12.6    56
 *   FILE the diff edits, named unambiguously                    1    4.2    23
 *
 * Only the last one is readable. A report of 191 paragraphs is the release-time
 * wall in a different costume, and gets skimmed the same way. Symbols were
 * dropped on that number, not on taste; the runner-up (identifier declared in
 * exactly one edited file) would have caught one more of the historical
 * instances and is named in the "does not cover" list below so the trade is on
 * the record rather than lost.
 *
 * ## Why it can never block
 *
 * There is no `ENFORCE` switch and deliberately so. "A pending changeset names a
 * file you edited" is not a defect - most of the time the sentence is still
 * true. The finding is a REQUEST TO READ, addressed to the one seat that can
 * answer it without re-deriving anything: the one whose own diff is the thing
 * that might have falsified it. A gate that failed a build on this would be
 * failing it for the prose being adjacent, which is exactly the "turned off
 * within a month" shape triage named.
 *
 * An unreadable input is still exit 1, never a pass. Report-only means this gate
 * declines to fail on its FINDINGS, never that it passes without looking
 * (objectstack#4928, objectui#4690).
 *
 * ## The correction path, and the gate that reports it
 *
 * When a re-read does find a falsified claim, correcting the body is the answer,
 * and it is precedented rather than forbidden. Two commits on `main` did it: the
 * `docs(changeset)` commit that corrected two present-tense claims a later pull
 * request falsified, and the one that dropped the stale cardinal from the
 * objectui#8315 changeset. Both are prose-only, both left frontmatter untouched.
 *
 * `check-changeset-overwrite.mjs` WILL report that correction, because it reports
 * every modification of a changeset the change did not add. That report is its
 * case 2 - "You are CORRECTING a declaration on purpose ... Legitimate, and the
 * reason this gate reports instead of failing" - and that gate is report-only, so
 * the correction is not mechanically barred. ⛔ Nothing here weakens it, narrows
 * it, or carves an exemption into it: the two gates are meant to fire together on
 * a correction, one asking for the read and the other recording the write.
 *
 * ## What objectui#9140 measured about this gate, after five live instances
 *
 * objectui#9065 was five WENT-FALSE claims at once. The gate was re-run on each
 * falsifying merge's own range, and the answer split two ways. Both halves are
 * recorded here because each one contradicts something this header assumes.
 *
 * HALF ONE - it named four of the five, and nobody acted on any of them. All
 * four false paragraphs then sat on `main` as pending release-note input until
 * objectui#9065 was filed BY HAND, and three had already been folded into the
 * standing Changesets release PR's staged CHANGELOGs. ⇒ the "REQUEST TO READ"
 * theory of change stated above has a measured delivery record, and on the one
 * shape this gate exists for that record is zero for four. ⛔ That is NOT an
 * argument for making it block - the measurement against blocking is unchallenged
 * and "Why it can never block" still rules. It is the datum whoever revisits that
 * trade needs, recorded rather than lost.
 *
 * HALF TWO - the fifth was invisible, and that is a SECOND historical instance on
 * the runner-up's side of the coordinate trade measured above. The one this gate
 * could not see is exactly the one whose body names no file at all: it coordinates
 * itself by symbol. `--audit` now counts that population - bodies that publish but
 * spell no name this gate can resolve - so the blind spot is re-derived on every
 * run instead of hand-counted per incident (rule #9 in AGENTS.md).
 *
 * ⛔ The coordinate was NOT widened, and the reason is a measurement, not taste.
 * objectui#9140 asked what it would take to bring that fifth instance into the
 * census. Its body reaches a file this gate could resolve through exactly ONE
 * spelling - the stem of a file name - and that one spelling is backticked by a
 * large fraction of the whole pending queue, because it is the name of one of this
 * repo's principal components. Admitting it admits every changeset that mentions
 * that component. Re-measured over the same 25-first-parent-commit population the
 * table above uses, that widening lands in the same band the runner-up was REJECTED
 * in, and it lands there on a channel half one just measured at zero for four. ⇒
 * widening the coordinate is a readability-budget decision, it is open, and it is
 * deliberately not taken here. The numbers are on objectui#9140; ⛔ they are not
 * copied into this header, which is rule #9 applied to this paragraph.
 *
 * ## Where it runs, and where the finding is DELIVERED
 *
 * `changeset-presence.yml`, as a second job. That workflow carries NO path
 * filter, which is what this gate needs and what `changeset-guard.yml` cannot
 * give it: the change that falsifies a pending claim is an ordinary source
 * change, and nothing guarantees it touches `.changeset/**` at all. It needs no
 * install and no build - a checkout, a tree listing and one batched blob read.
 *
 * On a pull request the finding is POSTED TO THAT PULL REQUEST, not left in a
 * job log (objectui#9140, director ruling, maintainer approved). HALF ONE above
 * measured the "REQUEST TO READ" theory of change at zero answers out of four,
 * and the seat that could answer cheaply is the one reading the pull request —
 * so the request is carried to where that seat already is. The channel is the
 * one the Console Performance Budget report uses: `actions/github-script`
 * calling the issue-comments API with the repository's existing
 * `pull-requests: write` grant on `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
 *
 * ⛔ Delivery changes NOTHING about enforcement. Exit is still 0 on findings,
 * the job is still not a required context, and the comment says so in its own
 * first sentences. "Why it can never block" above still rules, and the
 * measurement it rests on is untouched.
 *
 * `--json <file>` is the hand-off: this run's finding set, written once and
 * rendered by `scripts/render-changeset-claims-comment.mjs`. One comment per
 * pull request, updated in place on every re-run rather than stacked — the
 * renderer's own header carries the marker convention and why the marker is
 * plain text rather than an HTML comment.

    ⛔ This is NOT a claim that any of those paragraphs is false. This gate judges name
    resolution, never meaning: it asked whether a body NAMES a file you touched, which is
    as mechanical as asking whether a changeset exists. "Is this sentence still true?" is
    the one question it will not answer, and the one you are being asked to answer.

    Read the PARAGRAPH, not the line. Both false halves of the objectui#8617 claim sat in
    one paragraph, and correcting either alone would have left it asserting the same wrong
    thing.

    If a claim did go false, CORRECT THE BODY. That is precedented on this branch's history
    — the docs(changeset) commit that corrected two present-tense claims a later pull
    request falsified, and the one that dropped the stale cardinal from the objectui#8315
    changeset — and both were prose-only, with frontmatter untouched.
    \`check-changeset-overwrite.mjs\` will REPORT that correction, because it reports every
    modification of a changeset the change did not add. That report is its own case 2,
    "correcting a declaration on purpose ... legitimate", it is report-only, and it is the
    intended shape here: one gate asks for the read, the other records the write.

    ⛔ What this gate does NOT cover, stated so nobody reads it as more:
      - A born-false claim carrying no LINE ADDRESS. The section above this one now reads
        that class (objectui#9509) over the prose this change publishes about itself, but
        only where it spells a coordinate: objectui#9495's "a grep finds that member first"
        is an ORDINAL claim, and deciding it means reading what the sentence means.
      - A claim about anything it does not spell as a file name in backticks: a symbol, a
        package, an installed dependency's version, a count. Symbol matching was measured
        and dropped — it asked for 191 paragraphs per commit, which is the release-time
        wall in a different costume.
      - A file named ambiguously (\`index.ts\`, \`package.json\`). A span that resolves to many
        tracked files names none of them, and this gate does not guess.

    Report-only, with no enforcing switch: a pending changeset naming a file you edited is
    usually still true. The finding is a request to read, addressed to the one seat that can
    answer it cheaply — the one whose diff might have falsified it.`);
