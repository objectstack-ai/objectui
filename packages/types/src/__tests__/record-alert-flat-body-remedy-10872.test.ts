/**
 * `record:alert`'s flat `body` is refused with a remedy the block honours
 * (objectui#10872, batch 3).
 *
 * ## The defect these pin
 *
 * `record:alert`'s message TEXT is `properties.body`, a member of its spec row
 * (`ComponentPropsMap['record:alert']`). A `body` written flat on the node was
 * refused by `BaseSchema`'s objectui#6771 alias refusal, whose message sends the
 * author to `children`. This block renders no child list, and its arm refuses
 * `children` by name (objectui#9256), so an author who followed the message
 * moved the text to a key the validator refuses next and nothing renders.
 *
 * ## What moves, and what does not
 *
 * Only the prescription. The arm restates `body` with an alias refusal naming
 * `properties.body`; the accept set is the one `BaseSchema` gave it, so a flat
 * `body` is still refused with `invalid_type` at `body` on both faces, and
 * `properties.body` still parses. Every row below reads both faces: the
 * tolerant one `objectui validate` runs, and its derived strict twin.
