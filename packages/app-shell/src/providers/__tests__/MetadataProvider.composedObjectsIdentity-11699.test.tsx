/**
 * objectui#11699 — the context value's `objects` list is the same list, entry
 * for entry, for as long as the stored metadata it is built from is the same.
 *
 * ## What was measured
 *
 * On full reloads of a showcase record page (a real ObjectStack backend and a
 * production console build), the page read its record a second time, in
 * sequence. Instrumented, the record-load effect's second run had changed one
 * dependency, `objectDef`, and the new definition was JSON-equal to the old
 * one. Both definitions came out of this provider's `objects` getter at the
 * SAME context version, and neither was the stored item: the getter ran
 * `mergeViewsIntoObjects` + `attachInlineSubforms` on every read, and both
 * wrap every object they touch in a new object. So any re-render of a host
 * that reads `objects` handed its children new objects for unchanged
 * metadata. The record page now keys its read on data (its own pin is
 * `RecordDetailView.recordOpenRequests-11699.test.tsx`); this file pins the
 * provider half (AGENTS.md #10: "a provider ... may not republish an equal
 * payload as a new object").
 *
 * ## What these pins hold, in both directions
 *
 *   - Re-reading at the same version, and another metadata type landing (a new
 *     context value), hand back the same list and the same entries.
 *   - Replacing either stored array — the objects or the views — hands back a
 *     new list that carries the change. A cache that never let go would pass
 *     the first half and fail this one.
 *   - A DISCARDED `useMemo` cache — the context value's own — leaves the list
 *     where it was. React does not discard on its own in this tree (AGENTS.md
 *     #10), so the discard is forced by a module-level proxy, the technique and
 *     the reason of `packages/permissions`' `providerCtxIdentity.discarded.test.tsx`:
 *     every armed `useMemo` is thrown away, not ones picked by a marker. The
 *     case first shows the discard reached the provider (the context value IS a
 *     new object), then that the list did not move. A cache kept in the value's
 *     own `useMemo` would pass the first two bullets and fail this one.
 *
 *     ⚠️ Unlike that file, `useCallback` is NOT discarded here, and that is a
 *     measured choice, not an omission: discarding `bump` re-runs the
 *     provider's preview-mode effect, which lists it as a dependency and, after
 *     mount, clears the WHOLE metadata cache — so the list empties for a reason
 *     outside the getter this file pins. That effect's dependency on a
 *     memoised callback is its own latent AGENTS.md #10 hazard, recorded on
 *     objectui#11699 and not changed here.
 *
 * The fixture makes both helpers wrap: `task` has a list view (merged into its
 * `listViews`), and its `project` field declares `inlineEdit`, so `project`
 * gets a derived form `subforms` entry.
