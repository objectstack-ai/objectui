/**
 * ⭐ THE MEASURED SURFACE OF THE RETIRED-DIALECT FOLD — objectui#8938.
 *
 * objectui#8873 landed the fold at the ingestion choke point per the route
 * ruling, losslessly. What it declared was not what it measured: the changeset,
 * the pull request body and the acceptance all presented a handful of keys as
 * the accepted set, while the fold derives its width at RUN TIME from
 * `FieldSchema.shape` and folds the snake twin of every declared key that has
 * one — the gate keys (`visible_when` / `readonly_when` / `required_when`),
 * `default_value`, `required_permissions`, `delete_behavior`, `external_id`,
 * `depends_on`, and the managed-by lock keys `_lock_*` / `_package_id` /
 * `_package_version` among them.
 *
 * ## Why this file does not write the number down
 *
 * A count in prose is derived once and derived never again (AGENTS.md #9), and
 * this card exists because exactly that happened. So the correction states the
 * RULE and points at this file, and the pins below re-derive the surface from
 * the linked spec on every run:
 *
 *   - the width pin is UNIVERSALLY QUANTIFIED over `FieldSchema`'s declared key
 *     set. Add a camel key to the spec and this file demands its snake twin
 *     fold, with no edit here; replace the derivation with a hand table and it
 *     goes red on the first key the table forgets.
 *   - the enumerated keys of the original declaration are asserted to be a
 *     STRICT SUBSET, so "these four are the accepted set" can never read true
 *     again.
 *
 * ⛔ This file records the width; it does not rule on it. Whether the full
 * width — lock and gate keys included — is intended is the open decision on
 * objectui#8938 (c), which belongs to the director seat on objectui#7650.
 * Narrowing the fold means editing the class pins below on purpose, which is
 * the point of having them.
 *
 * ## The diagnostic — maintainer ruling item 3 (objectui#7650, comment 5572018999)
 *
 * "A loud diagnostic (not a silent drop) for a spelling the choke point cannot
 * fold." The fold's own warning covers the spelling it CAN fold; the three
 * refusals — no declared twin, an ambiguous probe, an occupied canonical key —
 * were silent, and each of them ends with a value no consumer reads. The pins
 * below measure all three, plus the two silences that must stay silent: a
 * spelling that folded (that is the other warning's case) and the reference
 * arm's own keys (that is objectui#6837's).
