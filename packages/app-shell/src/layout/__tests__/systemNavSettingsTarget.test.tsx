/**
 * Sidebar "System Settings" entry — must target `/apps/setup/system`, the host's
 * system landing (objectui#3590).
 *
 * ## The defect, and why both sidebars carried it
 *
 * `AppContent` decides which branch renders by string-matching the pathname:
 * `isSystemRoute = location.pathname.includes('/system')`. Only that flag mounts
 * the host's `extraRoutesNoApp` fragment, where `apps/console/src/AppContent.tsx`
 * declares `<Route path="system" />` (a card-wall hub when this was written; since
 * objectui#3743 a redirect onto the settings hub). A **bare** `/apps/setup`
 * therefore matches no pseudo-route except `isSetupRoute`, falls into the
 * `!activeApp && !isCreateAppRoute && !isSystemRoute && !isMetadataRoute` guard
 * and re-renders the "No Apps Configured" empty state. On a zero-app deployment
 * `/apps/setup` IS that empty state's own URL.
 *
 * Both sidebars pointed their `sys-settings` entry at that bare URL, in clusters
 * whose every OTHER entry already spells `/apps/setup/system/...`:
 *
 * - `AppSidebar.systemFallbackNavigation` rendered ONLY when `activeApp` was
 *   falsy, and `activeApp` there was `matched || activeApps[0]` — falsy exactly
 *   when the deployment had zero active+visible apps. So its head entry was dead
 *   in the one situation the cluster existed for. Its test left this file with
 *   the component (objectui#5817).
 * - `UnifiedSidebar.homeNavigation`'s Administration cluster is the `/home`
 *   admin nav added so a fresh env (no apps yet) still has a real menu —
 *   `resolveLandingPath([])` sends exactly that user to `/home`. Same head entry,
 *   same bare URL.
 *
 * These assert the URL the entry CARRIES, not a navigation: what the URL then
 * resolves to is `AppContent`'s question, and is pinned end-to-end (click →
 * mounted host landing) in `console/__tests__/AppContent.noAppsCta.test.tsx`, and
 * with the console host's real routes in `apps/console`'s
 * `src/__tests__/AppContent.systemHubRoutes.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## The measurement this file used to carry, and what replaced it (objectui#3609)
 *
 * When #3590 corrected `UnifiedSidebar`'s entry, that entry was not reachable:
 * the home arm hand-rolled `homeNavigation.map(item => <Link to={item.url ||
 * '/home'}>)` with no recursion, so the whole `type: 'group'` cluster collapsed
 * into one row pointing at `/home` and no child reached the DOM. Rather than
 * assert an href that never rendered, #3590 left a MEASUREMENT pin asserting the
 * broken shape — `Administration` carrying `href="/home"`, `System Settings`
 * absent — designed to go red the moment the group rendered its children.
 *
 * #3609 made it red by routing the home arm through the same
 * `NavigationRenderer` the app arm uses. The pin is therefore GONE, not
 * duplicated: it is replaced below by the real assertions it was standing in
 * for, so the repo pins the fix instead of pinning both the bug and the fix.
 *
 * ## The `Datasources` entry (objectui#3660)
 *
 * `ADMINISTRATION_ENTRIES` used to spell that entry
 * `/apps/setup/component/metadata/resource?type=datasource` — a legacy *alias*,
 * not a page, whose route element `<Navigate>`s straight on to
 * `/apps/setup/metadata/datasource`. Both sidebars were re-pointed at that
 * destination, and this file's expectation is REWRITTEN to match (same
 * discipline as above: replace the old shape, do not keep it alongside). The
 * `AppSidebar` test this file carried then gained the matching assertion at the
 * same time; that test left with the component (objectui#5817).
 *
 * ## The `Object Manager` entry (objectui#3739)
 *
 * #3660 re-pointed `sys-datasources` and stopped there; `sys-objects`, the entry
 * declared on the line immediately ABOVE it in both sidebars, kept spelling
 * `/apps/setup/system/metadata/object`. That is a legacy alias too — served by
 * `apps/console`'s `MetadataRedirect`, which `<Navigate>`s onto
 * `/apps/setup/metadata/object` — so the same redundant hop survived on the
 * neighbouring click target. Both literals were re-pointed at the destination,
 * and the expectation here is REWRITTEN rather than kept alongside, exactly as the
 * `Datasources` note above describes.
 *
 * Note what this file does NOT claim: that the URL resolves in one hop. That is
 * a property of the URL, not of the producer, and is measured once per family in
 * `systemNavDatasourcesHop.test.tsx` / `systemNavObjectsHop.test.tsx`. Here the
 * assertion is string equality on the href `UnifiedSidebar` emits — which is the
 * half that can drift, since the component holds its own literal.
