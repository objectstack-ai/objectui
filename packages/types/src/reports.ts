/**
 * @object-ui/types - Report Presentation Schema
 *
 * Defines the ObjectUI runtime *presentation* layer for reports:
 * sections, toolbar config, schedule UI, conditional formatting,
 * export presets, etc. These are UX enhancements that the
 * `@objectstack/spec` UI Protocol intentionally does not prescribe.
 *
 * ## Layering
 *
 * - **Protocol / definition:** `./spec-report.ts` re-exports the
 *   authoritative spec `Report` under `SpecReport`. JSON authored
 *   against the spec must work with ObjectUI without rewriting.
 *
 * - **Presentation (this file):** `ReportComponentSchema`, `ReportSection`,
 *   `ReportScheduleConfig`, etc. Drive the legacy `ReportRenderer` /
 *   `ReportViewer` / `ReportBuilder`. Will be gradually thinned as
 *   spec-native renderers take over (see plugin-report roadmap).
 *
 * Use {@link specReportToPresentation} (from `./spec-report`) to
 * convert a spec `Report` into this presentation shape during the
 * migration window.

   * lookup, reference, email, url, phone, image, richtext, json, datetime,

   * editor autocomplete offered a spelling the renderer refuses with a
   * tombstone. It moves in lockstep with its runtime twin
   * `ReportFieldSchema.type` (`packages/types/src/zod/reports.zod.ts`); the two
   * report faces are never split. Write an owner column as

   * JSON document can author that shape, and nothing ever read the key off a

   * `dataset` instead (ADR-0021). Measured zero authored occurrences in this
   * repo and in the sibling `objectstack` checkout, whose authored reports all
   * bind `dataset` — that measurement is the ruling's own deprecation-window
