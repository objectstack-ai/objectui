/**
 * Retirement pin — `UnifiedViewConfig.chart` is RETIRED (objectui#12063,
 * ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).
 *
 * ## What retired, and why
 *
 * The member declared the list-view chart's pre-ADR-0021 inline query:
 * `chartType` beside `xAxisField`, `yAxisFields`, `aggregation`, `series`,
 * `config` and `filter`. objectui#6152 round 15 retired every route that read
 * those axes, every list-view door refuses them by name, and nothing read or
 * wrote the member. The triage ruling on objectui#12063: with zero consumers it
 * retires with a tombstone that names the spec's list chart block (`dataset`,
 * `values`, `dimensions`, `chartType`) as the remedy. The census is recorded on
 * the card's pull request as a one-time reading; this file keeps the contract.
 *
 * ## Why a tombstone and not a deletion
 *
 * `UnifiedViewConfig` keeps a `[key: string]: any` index signature, so a
 * DELETED member would read `any` and admit every value, a fresh literal
 * included. Row (b) pins that consequence on an undeclared key, so the reason
 * is a reading and not prose. The interface has no zod mirror, so the
 * TypeScript face is the only face to retire.
 *
 * ## Two instruments, and which half each one reads
 *
 * The `Expect` / `Equal` aliases and the `@ts-expect-error` directives are
 * TYPE-level: `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` (the third leg of this package's
 * `type-check` script) reads them, and a revived or re-widened member fails
 * there, on an unused directive or on a `false` row. vitest strips types and
 * reads none of it. The `ListChartConfigSchema` rows are RUNTIME and vitest
 * reads them: they keep the remedy the tombstone names a live, parsing block.
 * A green run of either one alone says nothing about the other.
