title: "Field Registry"
---

Object UI uses a **Field Registry** system to decouple the core engine from specific UI implementations of fields. This allows for rich extensibility and plugin support.

## Concept

The `@object-ui/fields` package serves as the "Universal Language" for rendering values. 

When a component like `<ObjectGrid>` needs to render a `date` field, it doesn't import a DatePicker directly. Instead, it asks the registry:

> *"Hey, give me the component responsible for rendering type 'date'."*

This architecture allows you to:
1.  **Override standard fields** (e.g. replace the native date picker with a fancy one).
2.  **Add new field types** (e.g. add a `rating` or `signature` field).
3.  **Keep bundles small** (heavy components like Code Editors are loaded only if their plugin is registered).

## Usage

### 1. Registering a Custom Field

You can register a custom renderer globally, typically at your app's entry point.

```tsx
// src/setup.tsx
import { registerFieldRenderer, type CellRendererProps } from '@object-ui/fields';

const MyRatingField = ({ value, onChange }: CellRendererProps) => {
  return (
    <div className="rating">
      {[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(star => (
        <span 
          key={star} 
          onClick={() => onChange?.(star)}
          style={{ color: star <= value ? 'gold' : 'grey' }}
        >
          ★
        </span>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

// Register it
registerFieldRenderer('rating', MyRatingField);
```

### 2. Using in Schema

Once registered, you can simply use the new type in your JSON schema.

```json
{
  "type": "form",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "customer_satisfaction",
      "type": "rating", 
      "label": "Satisfaction"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Standard Fields

Object UI comes with built-in support for the standard [ObjectStack Protocol](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectstack/tree/main/packages/spec) types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `text` | Single line text |
| `textarea` | Multi-line text |
| `number` | Numeric input |
| `currency` | Currency formatting |
| `percent` | Percentage values |
| `date` | Date picker |
| `datetime` | Date & Time picker |
| `boolean` | Checkbox / Switch |
| `select` | Dropdown |
| `lookup` | Reference to another object |
| `master_detail` | Parent-child relationship |
| `user` | Person picker — searches the `sys_user` object (a lookup specialized to users) |
| `owner` | Record owner — a `user` field, typically read-only and stamped with the current user |

## What a number field silently rewrites

`number`, `currency`, `percent` and `geolocation` render a native
`type="number"` input. The browser — not ObjectUI — decides what that box will
accept, and it rewrites some entries **before any widget code runs**. Two
different things can happen, and only one of them is announced.

### Announced: text the browser cannot read

If the box is left holding something that is not a complete number, the browser
reports `validity.badInput` and these widgets now say so: the control is marked
`aria-invalid="true"` and a message is drawn under it —

> Not saved: the text in this box is not a number. Enter a plain decimal (example: 1234.56).

The sentence follows the reader's language (objectui#8148) — it resolves through
the `fields.number.badInput` locale key, so a console running in Chinese,
Japanese or Arabic refuses in that language. The example numeral is the
widget's own (`1234` for `number`, `1234.56` for `currency`, `12.5` for
`percent`, `30.2741` / `120.1551` for the two `geolocation` boxes) and stays
verbatim in every language.

Measured in Chromium 141, typing any of `1e`, `1e-`, `1e+`, `5e`, `-`, `.`,
`+`, `-.` or `e` leaves the box **visibly displaying** what was typed while its
value reads empty. Before this was announced, the field simply stored nothing
and said nothing.

### ⚠️ NOT announced: entries the browser silently truncates

This is the important limitation, and it is deliberate rather than an oversight.

| you paste / type | the field stores |
|---|---|
| `1.2.3` | `1.23` |
| `0x10` | `10` |
| `12abc` | `12` |

**No warning is shown for these, and no widget-side check can add one.** The
browser filters the keystrokes or the pasted text as it arrives, so by the time
ObjectUI sees the field the discarded characters are already gone — there is
nothing left to detect. This is native `type="number"` behaviour; recovering it
would mean giving up the numeric keyboard on mobile and the `min`/`max`/`step`
spinner on every numeric field in the product.

⛔ **So do not read "no warning" as "the value is correct."** A warning means the
browser could not read the box at all. Silence means the browser read
*something* — which may be less than you typed. When exact input matters
(reference codes, serial numbers, anything where `1.2.3` is meaningful), declare
a `text` field, not a numeric one.

## Using Renderers in Custom Components

If you are building your own custom component (like a Kanban board card), you can leverage the registry to render fields without reinventing the wheel.

```tsx
import { getCellRenderer } from '@object-ui/fields';

export const KanbanCard = ({ task }: { task: { name: string; assignee: string } }) => {
  // Get the standard renderer for a 'user' type field
  const UserRenderer = getCellRenderer('user');
  
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h3>{task.name}</h3>
      <div className="assignee">
        <UserRenderer 
          value={task.assignee} 
          field={{ type: 'user', name: 'assignee' }} 
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
