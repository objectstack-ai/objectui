/**
 * File field value shapes (ObjectStack ADR-0104 D3 wave 2).
 *
 * A `file`/`image`/`avatar`/`video`/`audio` field value reaches the UI in one
 * of three forms, and every widget that renders one has to cope with all
 * three — so the rules live here once rather than being re-derived per widget.
 *
 *  1. **Reference** — a bare `sys_file` id string. The form the backend stores
 *     once file-as-reference is adopted.
 *  2. **Expanded** — `{ id, name, size, mimeType, url }`, what the read path
 *     returns after resolving a stored reference. Note `mimeType`: this comes
 *     from the platform's spec-owned `FileValueSchema` and is **camelCase**.
 *  3. **Legacy inline blob** — `{ file_id?, name, original_name, size,
 *     mime_type, url }`, the pre-reference shape this package used to build
 *     itself, with **snake_case** `mime_type`.
 *
 * That casing split is the whole reason this module exists: a widget reading
 * only `mime_type` silently stops recognising images the moment the backend
 * starts returning the expanded form, and the failure looks like "thumbnails
 * disappeared" rather than anything pointing at a value shape.
 *
 * ## Submitting
 *
 * A completed upload is submitted as the **bare `sys_file` id** the adapter
 * surfaced in `meta.fileId` — the reference form, and the only form the stored
 * contract admits (`valueSchemaFor(field, 'stored')` is the id-only
 * `FileReferenceIdValueSchema` since spec `17.0.0`; ADR-0104's 2026-09-05
 * addendum fixes the physical column to a string column holding that bare id).
 * When no `fileId` came back — the object-URL default `useUpload()` falls open
 * to, an S3/Azure-style adapter that mints no `sys_file` row, a custom adapter
 * that dropped it — the submit is **refused** with {@link UploadIncompleteError}
 * and ⛔ no inline blob is sent: the legacy `{ name, original_name, size,
 * mime_type, url }` object is a shape no deployment's stored contract accepts
 * (admitted warn-first only on a deployment that has not yet verified its
 * file-as-reference migration, rejected with `invalid_type` everywhere else),
 * so sending it turned an upload into a save refused by the backend
 * (objectui#7699). ADR-0104's dual-read window is a READ rule: a legacy blob
 * already on a record still renders through `readFileValue`; nothing here
 * writes a new one. Action params already POST a bare fileId; record field
 * values are on the same contract.

 * against a faithful copy, so reference identity is the only check that can tell
 * a re-export from a fork. It is asserted in
 * `__tests__/spec-symbol-batch7.test.ts`.
 *
 * Why it matters that this one is shared rather than duplicated: the regex is a
 * WIRE decision. Widening it server-side (say, ids grow past 64 chars) while a
 * copy here keeps the old bound turns every new id into "not a reference", and
 * `fileValueForSubmit` then refuses every upload as incomplete — loud, but
 * pointing at the adapter while the cause is a regex two packages away.
