/**
 * The Flow Runs flow picker is the shared `Select` (objectui#11865).
 *
 * The page picked the flow to test with a browser-native select, beside the
 * shared Radix `Select` the rest of the console picks with. The card asks for
 * one control for one kind of choice, surface by surface.
 *
 * What is pinned:
 *   - the picker IS the primitive (a Radix combobox trigger), shows the picked
 *     flow, and no native select is left;
 *   - the trigger's accessible name is what the native control's was;
 *   - every flow, picked, is the one Run Flow executes and whose runs are
 *     listed, the same calls the native control led to, compared as JSON text;
 *   - a flow a Refresh no longer lists is what the trigger shows;
 *   - the keyboard alone opens the picker and selects.
 *
 * Read-only: the page has no such state.
 *
 * DIRECTION, observed against the native control: every pin here but the name
 * pin is red there, because each one reads the picker as the primitive's
 * trigger. What makes the call pins guards of "the conversion changed nothing
 * the page runs" is the literal each compares against: a `change` event on the
 * pre-conversion page's native control, then the same Run Flow click, led to
 * those same calls, read once on that page with these fixtures. The name and
 * the Refresh reading were taken there the same way.
 *
 * A pick reloads the flow list (the page's `loadFlows` depends on the picked
 * name), so the picker unmounts while the list loads and mounts again: each
 * case finds the trigger afresh after a pick, as a user's next look would.
