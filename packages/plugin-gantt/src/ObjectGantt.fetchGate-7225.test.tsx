 * objectui#7225 ask 2 — the gantt's DUPLICATE query is gated (maintainer
 * ruling B, 2026-09-02; objectui#6482's undischarged gating half).
 *
 * Before this, `reload` listed `objectSchema` in its dependency list, so a
 * mount issued TWO `find` calls: one before the object schema settled, with
 * `buildExpandFields` seeing no fields and therefore NO `$expand` at all, and
 * one after. Measured on this component with an instrumented adapter over
 * three latency profiles — invariably 2 `find` and 1 `getObjectSchema` per
 * load, expand sets `[null, ['owner']]`.
 *
 * ⭐ Why gating pays HERE, per #6482's own per-component standard (it measured
 * three profiles and found the cost differs by component, so the table is not
 * an argument on its own): the gantt is not the mild kanban-style "round trip
 * bought and thrown away". Whenever the metadata read is the slower of the two
 * — the common case on a cold `MetadataCache` — the user sees the full
 * THREE-STEP PAINT: raw foreign-key ids, back to the loading placeholder, then
 * the expanded rows.
 *
 * ⛔ GATING IS NOT CAPPING. objectui#7210's ruling a' put a row ceiling on
 * these queries and that is a different change on the same lines; this file
 * asserts only HOW MANY queries go out and whether the first one carries its
 * expansion. The ceiling has its own pin
 * (`ObjectGantt.rowCeiling-7210.test.tsx`).
 *
 * ⚠️ The gate is only safe because the schema resolution now SETTLES ON EVERY
 * EXIT (objectui#7232): the component's own effect used to return without
 * settling on `!effectiveDataSource`, on `!resource` and in its `catch`, which
 * cost nothing while nothing waited on it — and would hold a gated query open
 * FOREVER. `useSettledSchema` settles on all three, and the last two cases
 * below are that trap, pinned: a chart that never loads is the failure this
 * file exists to make impossible.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — prediction MISSED, reported rather than adjusted.
 * Predicted before running: deleting
 * `if (recordQueryDerivesExpand && !objectSchemaReady) return;` from
 * `ObjectGantt` turns the first two cases red and leaves the two
 * settle-on-every-exit cases green — 2 failed / 3 passed. OBSERVED:
 * **4 failed / 1 passed**. Direction as predicted, magnitude higher, and the
 * reason is worth writing down: the prediction assumed the second query came
 * from `objectSchema`'s identity changing, so a definition that settles as
 * `null` (no `getObjectSchema`, or a read that threw) would still produce one
 * query. It does not. The second query comes from `objectSchemaReady` being in
 * the effect's DEPENDENCY LIST — it flips `false` to `true` on every path,
 * including both settle-with-nothing paths, so with the early return deleted
 * the effect re-runs and reloads a second time in all four adapter cases. The
 * inline-`value` case is the one that stays green, since it never queries at
 * all. The gate line and the dependency are two halves of one mechanism, and
 * the ablation only removed one of them.
