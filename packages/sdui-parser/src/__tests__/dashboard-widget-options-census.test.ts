/**
 * ObjectUI — the renderer-consumed-keys census, re-measured every run
 * (objectui#5709)
 *
 * `CONSUMED_WIDGET_OPTION_KEYS` is a hand-pinned list, and a hand-pinned list
 * about SOMEONE ELSE'S code is wrong the day that code moves. The 2026-08-23
 * ruling made the census the load-bearing half of the warning ("a false
 * positive on a key that IS consumed is worse than no warning"), so this file
 * re-derives every input the list was pinned from, on every test run:
 *
 *  1. the DECLARED set, from the installed `@objectstack/spec` schema — the
 *     same source the platform's save gate parses with;
 *  2. the CONSUMED set, extracted from `DatasetWidget.tsx` source text — the
 *     one component every spec-legal (dataset-bound) widget renders through.
 *     It is the declared five and nothing else: `description`, the metric
 *     sub-caption objectui#7293 read here, is retired at both ends
 *     (objectui#11389, ruling C), so the accepted set, the declared set and
 *     the measured read set are one set;
 *  3. the ABSENCE of the retired sub-caption's readers across
 *     `plugin-dashboard`, with a lit control on the same scan;
 *  4. a repo tripwire for NEW files that start reading `widget.options`.
 *
 * ## What the instrument can and cannot see — read before trusting a verdict
 *
 * The extractor is a TEXT census: it matches `options.<identifier>` in one
 * file whose `options` binding it first proves to be the widget-options bag,
 * and it counts comments as reads. Both biases point the SAFE way (a key
 * wrongly counted consumed draws no warning — a false negative, never a false
 * positive). What it CANNOT follow is a consumption shape with no `options.`
 * spelling: a spread (`{ ...options }`), a destructuring (`const { x } =
 * options`), a computed access (`options[k]`), or the bag passed wholesale to
 * a helper. Those shapes exist in this repo — on the LEGACY (non-dataset)
 * dispatch branches the warning deliberately skips — so the census stays
 * honest by REFUSING them where it measures: their appearance in
 * `DatasetWidget.tsx` fails this file loudly instead of silently
 * under-counting. The tripwire has its own stated blind spot: it matches the
 * receiver spelling `widget.options` / `widget?.options`, so a read through a
 * renamed receiver is invisible to it (`legacyRetiredWidget.ts`'s
 * `w.options?.data` is the known live example — on a branch the warning
 * skips). It exists to catch new FILES joining the surface under the common
 * spelling, not to be a proof.
 *
 * Maintenance cost, measured while building it: when a renderer gains or
 * loses a consumed key, this file goes red and the fix is editing ONE array
 * (`CONSUMED_WIDGET_OPTION_KEYS`) plus its census notes; when the spec
 * declares a new key, same; when a new file starts reading the bag, the
 * tripwire's allowlist is the edit. The scan itself is ~70ms over ~1.5k
 * files.
