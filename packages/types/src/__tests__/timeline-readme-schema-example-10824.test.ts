/**
 * The "Schema-Driven Usage" example on `@object-ui/plugin-timeline`'s README
 * must survive the contract this package ships — `safeValidateSchema` from
 * `@object-ui/types/zod`, the call `objectui validate` makes (objectui#10824).
 *
 * ## The hole this closes
 *
 * The README taught its node as `component: 'timeline'`. Every node in this
 * protocol is keyed by `type`, so `safeValidateSchema` refused the document
 * exactly as a reader would copy it (`invalid_union` at `type`), and the page
 * ships on npm — `README.md` is in that package's `files`. No gate was asking:
 *
 *   - `check:doc-types` judges `type` string literals, and a node spelled with
 *     `component` has none, so there was nothing for it to judge;
 *   - `check:readme-exports` judges import bindings, not metadata literals;
 *   - `check:doc-snippets` compiles fenced code against the built `dist/`, and
 *     this block is an unannotated `const schema = { … }` literal, so nothing in
 *     it is a type the compiler could refuse.
 *
 * So this file asks the one question nobody was asking of this page: does the
 * example it teaches validate. `plugin-dashboard`'s
 * `readme-dashboard-examples-spec-valid.test.ts` asks the same of that
 * package's README, and this is that pattern applied here, not a new one.
 *
 * ## Why BOTH faces are read
 *
 * The tolerant face is `.passthrough()`: a key it does not declare is kept and
 * judged by nothing. So on its own it cannot tell "every key the page teaches is
 * declared" from "the page teaches `type` AND a stray key nobody reads" — a
 * README that said `type: 'timeline', component: 'timeline'` would pass it. The
 * strict authoring face (`StrictAnyComponentSchema`, objectui#8345) closes every
 * object to its declared keys, so it is the reading that answers the second
 * question. Both are asserted; the tolerant face is the card's criterion and is
 * asserted first.
 *
 * ## Why the block is EXTRACTED and evaluated, never mirrored here
 *
 * A copy of the example in this file would be a second, hand-kept twin of the
 * page — the construction that let the page drift in the first place. So the
 * block is read out of `README.md` on every run: the section is bounded by its
 * own `##` heading, fence pairing is `scripts/markdown-fence-scan.mjs` (the
 * repository's one answer to "does this line open a fence, and what closes
 * it"), and the literal is evaluated as JavaScript, which is what reads its
 * comments and trailing commas the way a reader's editor does. A block the
 * harness cannot find or cannot evaluate FAILS; it is never skipped, because an
 * unexaminable block that reads as a clean one is the shape the doc-gate family
 * exists to prevent (objectui#4846).
 *
 * ## Why it lives here and not in `packages/plugin-timeline`
 *
 * It reads a file off disk, and `packages/plugin-timeline/tsconfig.test.json`
 * names no `node` types, so a `node:fs` import there does not type-check — the
 * reason that package's `metaFields` source pin lives elsewhere too. This
 * package's test config names them, owns both faces the document is judged
 * against, and already reads another plugin's README the same way
 * (`calendar-flat-color-allday-8466.test.ts`).
