/**
 * The DISPLAY half of the three rich-content field types — `markdown`, `html`
 * and `richtext` — and the single table that says which pipeline each one
 * reads through.
 *
 * ## Why this is its own module (objectui#5498)
 *
 * These two renderers used to live in `../index.tsx`, which meant the only way
 * to reach them was through the barrel — and the barrel is what registers
 * `RichTextField`, so the widget could not import them back without a cycle.
 * The readonly branch of `RichTextField` therefore rendered `{value}` as a
 * React TEXT CHILD and showed a user the markup SOURCE of their own field: a
 * `markdown` field's asterisks and hashes, a `richtext` field's tags. Every
 * OTHER read surface — grid, kanban card, gallery, related list, dashboard
 * record panel, record detail read mode — dispatches through `getCellRenderer`
 * and rendered the same stored bytes FORMATTED, so one field disagreed with
 * itself depending on which surface the user was looking at.
 *
 * Extracting them here is what lets both sides consume the SAME components:
 * `getCellRenderer`'s table spreads {@link RICH_TEXT_CELL_RENDERERS}, and the
 * widget's readonly branch indexes it. There is one dispatch table for these
 * three types, not two that can drift — which matters because drift is exactly
 * how objectui#5452 happened (`richtext` pointing at the markdown pipeline).

/**
 * The text a rich-content cell formats, or `undefined` when the record holds
 * nothing to format (objectui#8580).
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` types all three rich-content fields as a plain string
 * (`STRING_VALUE_TYPES`; the write seam is `z.string()`), the same value
 * class as `text` / `textarea` / `code`. Both renderers below used to test the
 * RAW value (`value == null || value === ''`) and then `String()` it, which is
 * how the two off-contract shapes the census measured came out:
 *
 *   - `[]` passed the guard and `String([])` is `''`: the markdown pipeline
 *     drew a childless `prose` DIV (its Suspense fallback a childless SPAN),
 *     the HTML pipeline a childless `prose` DIV. Nothing drawn and no
 *     accessible name, where every other text-like type already answered
 *     with the shared `EmptyValue` — the objectui#8481 class, one family over.
 *   - `{}` passed and `String({})` is `[object Object]`: a coercion artefact
 *     no sibling prints (`text` prints `[Object]`).
 *
 * Two shapes, two rulings, one mechanism: test the COERCED text, exactly as
 * `TextCellRenderer` does. `[]` coerces to `''` and holds no string, so the
 * cell has no value and says so. `{}` is NOT swept into the affordance — the
 * record is storing something, so "No value" would be false — and is not
 * `String()`'d either: it takes the string class's existing answer for an
 * object (`coerceToSafeValue`: the display name when the object carries one,
 * `[Object]` otherwise), and that text is then formatted like any other. A
 * populated string is returned verbatim by `coerceToSafeValue`, so the
 * populated branch of each renderer below — and the HTML sanitiser it runs
 * through — sees the same bytes it always did.

 * COMPLETELY EMPTY cell, because a richtext value is entirely HTML and this
 * pipeline drops all of it; see {@link HtmlCellRenderer}, which is where that
 * type belongs. Loosening this pipeline to pass raw HTML through would have
 * "fixed" one type by moving every `markdown` cell's trust boundary.
 *
 * What the cell holds is decided by {@link richTextSource} (objectui#8580):

 * HTML/WYSIWYG", the showcase seed's own specimen is
 * `<p>Rich <strong>text</strong></p>`, and this repo's designer bridge already
 * maps `richtext` onto its `html` type. {@link sanitizeHtml} above removes
 * script/style/iframe/object/embed blocks, inline event handlers and

 * emits — headings, paragraphs, emphasis, lists, links, quotes all survive, so
 * routing `richtext` here restores the content rather than trading a blank cell

 * `[]` is the No-value affordance, never a childless `prose` container, and
 * an object is the text the string class prints for it. The populated branch
 * stays on {@link sanitizeHtml}: a stored string comes back from
 * `richTextSource` verbatim, so the bytes that reach the sanitiser are the

 * ## Why this export exists
 *
 * objectui#4831 asked, in its own body, whether the hand-written type lists
 * that keep omitting the third of this widget's three registry keys should
 * become "every type that resolves to the long-text widget". It was answered
 * by adding one literal, and the omission recurred (objectui#4250,
 * objectui#8438). This is that question answered in the other direction: a
 * consumer that spreads this list cannot omit a key, because it never names
 * one. Adding a fourth key to {@link RICH_TEXT_CELL_RENDERERS} extends every
 * such consumer in the same commit that adds the key.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is NOT a general "long text" list and must not be used as one:
 * `textarea` renders a `<Textarea>` too and is deliberately absent, because it
 * is a different widget with its own registry key and its own metadata face.
 * The invariant this list states is narrower and exact — *these are the keys
 * `RichTextField` serves*.
