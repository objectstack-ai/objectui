 * objectui#8253 — the host `tree` view config is EXPORTED, and this file is
 * what stops the next refactor un-exporting it in silence.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `tree` is a host-composition-only view type (objectui#5321, ruling B): it is
 * on neither authored union, so the branch runs only when a host passes a
 * `views` prop. On that path a per-view `tree` block is read — and its only
 * description anywhere was the module-local, non-exported `interface TreeConfig`
 * in `ObjectTree.tsx`. The live host is the console: it stores view records and
 * passes them as `views`, and its create-view dialog offers `tree`. So a real
 * consumer wrote this block with no type to write it against, and a misspelled
 * `parentFeild` was admitted by the views entry's `[key: string]: any`, read by
 * nobody, and reported by nothing. Declared ≠ enforced, class (c).
 *
 * Ruled on objectui#8253 (director seat, decision batch #78, 2026-09-07,
 * maintainer 「同意」), option (a): `packages/types` exports the config, the
 * module-local copy becomes an import of it, and ⛔ there is no second copy.
 *
 * ## What objectui#8841 changed here
 *
 * objectui#8253 shipped that export as a hand-written interface — a copy of the
 * protocol's `ListView.tree` block under a second name — and the copy declared a
 * fifth key, `titleField`, that `@objectstack/spec@17.4.0` REFUSES there. The
 * pins in this file did not catch it because the census was a LITERAL KEY LIST
 * maintained beside the type: the list was written to match the drift, so it
 * agreed with the defect. objectui#8841 re-derives the type from the protocol
 * and re-pins the census as PARITY WITH THE PROTOCOL — plus a runtime leg that
 * reads the installed `TreeConfigSchema` by content, because a compile-time pin
 * on a derived alias can only restate its own derivation.
 *
 * ## Why the import below says `@object-ui/types` and not `../../types/src`
 *
 * This is the load-bearing part of the pin, not a style choice. This package's
 * `tsconfig.test.json` sets `"paths": {}` precisely so `@object-ui/*` resolves
 * through the WORKSPACE DEPENDENCY rather than through the root tsconfig's
 * source-tree mapping — so the specifier below is resolved the way a published
 * consumer resolves it: `packages/types/package.json` `exports["."].types` →
 * `dist/index.d.ts`. A pin that imported `'../../types/src/views'` would never
 * touch `dist` or the `exports` map and would stay green through a barrel that
 * had stopped re-exporting the name, or an `exports` map that had stopped
 * publishing the entry. This one goes red for both.
 *
 * ⚠️ Consequence, and it is deliberate: `@object-ui/types` must be BUILT before
 * `pnpm --filter @object-ui/plugin-tree type-check` means anything. A stale
 * `dist/*.d.ts` lies in both directions.
 *
 * ## The assertions are compile-time; vitest alone would not catch a broken pin
 *
 * Same mechanism as `types/src/__tests__/drill-down-config-declared-keys.test.ts`:
 * `tsconfig.json` excludes tests (they must not emit into `dist`) and
 * `tsconfig.test.json` picks them back up, chained off the package's
 * `type-check` script. Vitest strips types without checking them. The runtime
 * `expect` at the foot of each type-level case is a marker, ⛔ never the pin.
