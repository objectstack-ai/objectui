/**
 * Approvals Inbox — a reference that neither resolves nor carries a snapshot
 * title renders a CAUSE-FREE affordance, never the opaque record id
 * (objectui#8631).
 *
 * ## The defect, and the fence around its fix
 *
 * objectui#7108 tombstones the class the platform FLAGS (`status: 'cancelled'`
 * + `cancel_reason: 'record_deleted'`). A terminal (`approved` / `rejected`)
 * row carries no such flag and never will — the upstream cancel path names
 * `status: 'pending'` in its `where` — so a terminal row whose record no longer
 * resolves kept degrading to the opaque record id.
 *
 * The triage ruling is a neutral affordance plus an explicit fence: ⛔ do not
 * distinguish "deleted" from "not visible", because that distinction is an
 * existence oracle the platform declines to answer everywhere else. So the
 * cases below pin BOTH halves — the affordance is present on every surface,
 * and it says nothing about the cause.
 *
 * ## What each case measures, and why a weaker pin would pass on worse code
 *
 * - "no raw id" alone passes on a row that renders NOTHING, which costs the
 *   approver the fact that an approval exists — strictly worse than the id. So
 *   presence, text and the survival of the rest of the row are all pinned.
 * - The negative control is the fence itself, pinned as a test rather than as a
 *   comment: the rendered TEXT carries neither a deletion word nor a
 *   permissions word, and the DOM carries the record id in neither form (the
 *   truncated one it displayed nor the full one it used to hang in a `title`
 *   attribute on every row). ⚠️ That control is `en`-only, deliberately and
 *   with the alternative refused — the case itself states exactly what the
 *   other nine packs are and are not checked for, so this paragraph is not
 *   the last word a reader gets on the fence's coverage.
 * - The discriminating fixture rows are the two this must NOT touch: a row
 *   whose snapshot kept a business identifier (objectui#5211 keeps showing it
 *   and only withholds the link) and a row the SERVER marked `record_deleted`
 *   (which keeps the platform's own stronger sentence). A widened predicate
 *   reds one of those two.
 *
 * ## Fixture notes
 *
 * The probe's answer FUSES the two causes exactly as the platform's read path
 * does: the deleted record and the merely-invisible ones are all simply absent
 * from the `id in (…)` read, and nothing in the answer separates them.
 *
 * `queryAllByText` / `within(row)` throughout, never a bare `queryByText`: the
 * inbox renders each request twice (desktop table + mobile card), so a bare
 * query THROWS on the multiple match rather than reporting a miss.
 *
 * No build artifact sits between the edit and this test: the root Vitest config
 * aliases every `@object-ui` specifier at that package's source directory, and
 * the page, the probe and the affordance under test are this app's own source.
