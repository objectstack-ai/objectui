/**
 * The metadata-admin form **authoring surface**, in ONE declaration.
 *
 * `FormFieldSpec` is what an author may write on a form-layout field. It has
 * two consumers and they used to hold two different descriptions of it:
 * `SchemaForm.tsx` declared it as the element type of `FormSectionSpec.fields`,
 * and `widgets.tsx` declared its own inline copy as `WidgetProps.fieldSpec`.
 * The copies disagreed — the widget-side one declared `dependsOn`, which
 * `field-selector` and `dynamic-config` read as required configuration, and
 * the authoring-side one did not — so the only configuration that makes those
 * widgets work did not type-check for anyone who typed their spec
 * (objectui#5040). One value travelled down one channel and was described twice.
 *
 * It lives in a leaf rather than in `SchemaForm.tsx` because the import runs
 * the other way: `SchemaForm.tsx` imports `./widgets.js`, so a back-edge from
 * `widgets.tsx` would close a cycle. A module that imports nothing at RUNTIME is
 * importable from both sides. `SchemaForm.tsx` re-exports all three names, so the
 * surface every existing importer reaches for is unchanged.
 *
 * ## The two containers above the leaf (objectui#5596)
 *
 * `FormSectionSpec` and `FormViewSpec` were hand-declared TWICE for the same
 * reason and with the same result: once in `SchemaForm.tsx`, once in
 * `apps/console`'s `FormPage.tsx`. Unlike the field spec, whose console copy was
 * a clean subset, these two had already drifted in BOTH directions -- so neither
 * was a subset of the other and there were two live answers to what an author
 * may write:
 *
 *   FormSectionSpec  app-shell had `description`/`visibleWhen`/`visibleOn`; the
 *                    console had none of them. The console's `columns` admitted
 *                    the string arm (`'1'|'2'|'3'|'4'`); app-shell's took
 *                    numbers only.
 *   FormViewSpec     the console had `label`/`groups`/`sharing`/`submitBehavior`;
 *                    app-shell stopped at `type` plus `sections`.
 *
 * Both are now DERIVED from `@objectstack/spec`'s own `FormSection` / `FormView`
 * rather than restated, which is the repo's sanctioned form for a spec-shaped
 * local type (`scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs`). The import is
 * `import type`, so this module still pulls in nothing at runtime and the leaf
 * property above is unchanged.
 *
 * Deriving decides the drift by asking the contract instead of a reader:
 * `columns` DOES admit the string arm (`FormSectionSchema.columns` is a union of
 * `z.enum(['1','2','3','4'])` with the four numeric literals, folded to a number
 * by its own transform), so app-shell's numbers-only declaration was rejecting
 * metadata the platform accepts -- objectui#5040's symptom, not a deliberate
 * narrowing. `description`, `visibleWhen`, `visibleOn`, and also `name` and
 * `pane`, are likewise spec keys that simply went undeclared on one side or the
 * other.
 *
 * ## Why DERIVED-WITH-NAMED-NARROWINGS and not a bare re-export
 *
 * A bare `export type FormSectionSpec = FormSection` would put two different
 * answers INSIDE one document, one nesting level apart, because the spec writes
 * its containers in vocabularies the converged leaf above deliberately does not
 * use:
 *
 *   - `FormSection.label` / `.description` are the spec's `I18nLabel`
 *     (`string | InlineLocaleMap`). `FormFieldSpec.label` -- already converged,
 *     already landed -- is `string`, because both renderers put the value
 *     straight into a text slot and neither resolves a locale map. A section
 *     admitting `{ en: 'x' }` above a field refusing it is the same defect class
 *     this file exists to close.
 *   - `FormSection.visibleWhen` / `.visibleOn` are the spec's `ExpressionInput`
 *     (`dialect` REQUIRED and enum-typed, `source` optional, plus `ast`/`meta`).
 *     The predicate that actually reaches an evaluator here is
 *     {@link VisibilityPredicate} -- `dialect` optional, `source` required --
 *     which is the shape `@object-ui/core`'s `evalFieldPredicate` takes.
 *   - `FormSection.fields` elements are the spec's `FormField` (29 keys), not
 *     the 26-key {@link FormFieldSpec} objectui#5542 converged and pinned.
 *     Re-pointing that position is what would silently re-open #5542.
 *   - `FormFieldSpec.options` elements are the spec's `SelectOption`, with
 *     `visibleWhen` re-pointed to {@link VisibilityPredicate} and `default`
 *     dropped (objectui#6247). This was the last position still hand-written
 *     rather than derived, and what it cost is written out at that key: two of
 *     the spec's five option keys were dropped by SILENCE, which is how a
 *     legally-authored per-option `visibleWhen` came to parse clean and render
 *     inert.
 *
 * So every key the two layers agree on comes FROM the spec and cannot fall
 * behind it, and each position where this layer is deliberately narrower is
 * named in an `Omit` list and restated once, next to its reason.
 * `form-spec.containers.test.tsx` pins both halves: that the derived keys really
 * are the spec's, and that each narrowing still refuses the arm it means to
 * refuse. Its console twin, `FormPage.viewSpec.test.ts`, pins the same two
 * types back out of that app's own renderer signature.

   * It was a hand-written `{ label; value; color? }` triple: three of the

   * named narrowing — the one element type in this file that the header's
   * "every key the two layers agree on comes FROM the spec" rule had never

   * could legally write a per-option predicate into a `*.form.ts`, have it

   * really does declare it), and get a narrowing that this renderer then
   * ignored: accepted, stored, shipped, inert — ADR-0049's declared≠enforced,
   * and failing in the PERMISSIVE direction (the option stayed offered).
   *
   *   - `visibleWhen` is RE-POINTED, not dropped: the spec's `ExpressionInput`
   *     makes `dialect` required and `source` optional, while the predicate
   *     that actually reaches an evaluator here is {@link VisibilityPredicate}
   *     (`dialect` optional, `source` required) — the same re-pointing, for the
   *     same reason, that `FormSectionSpec` already makes for its own
   *     `visibleWhen` / `visibleOn`. One vocabulary per document.
   *   - `default` stays DROPPED, and now says so. Nothing on this surface reads
   *     it: none of the three controls that consume `options` seeds a value
   *     from it, so declaring it here would advertise an authoring key this
   *     renderer does not honour — the very shape the `visibleWhen` half of
   *     this comment exists to close.

   *     ⚠️ RULED 2026-08-28 (objectui#6263 / objectstack#12868, executed

   *     question this file is holding open: the FORM-VIEW option vocabulary
   *     does not accept a per-option `default`, and the drop above is now the
   *     ruled shape rather than a pending decision. **Where the pre-selected
   *     choice IS declared:** on the OBJECT definition — the field's
   *     `defaultValue`, or the object option's own `default: true`, which the
   *     engine honours on the insert path (`applyFieldDefaults` falls back to
   *     the option marked `default: true` when the field declares no
   *     `defaultValue`; `defaultValue` wins when both are declared —
   *     objectstack#7246, ruled `enforce`, PR #7388). That is why
   *     `SelectOptionSchema` still carries the key and only this reference site
   *     narrows it: one surface honours it, this one deliberately does not, and
   *     a second default contract here is what the 2026-08-10 ruling's objectui
   *     rider told the console not to grow.
   *
   *     ⛔ Removing `'default'` from the `Omit` below re-admits it. That is now
