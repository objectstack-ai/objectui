# Feeds the hook the same JSON payload shape Claude Code delivers on PreToolUse and asserts
# the block/allow verdict per command. Hermetic: it builds its OWN throwaway git repo, a
# linked worktree of it, and a non-repo directory under $TMPDIR, so the matrix never depends
# on which machine or which checkout it runs from. Needs jq and git and nothing else — no
# install, no build, no network. Exit 0 = all cases hold.

# Mirrors .claude/hooks/guard-shared-stash.selftest.sh case-for-case in shape.
