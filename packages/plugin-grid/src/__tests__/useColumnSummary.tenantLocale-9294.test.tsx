 * objectui#9294 — every arm of the grid column-summary footer formats in the
 * TENANT's locale, not the MACHINE's.
 *
 * `formatSummaryLabel` handed `Intl` an `undefined` locale at seven call
 * sites. `undefined` does not mean "no opinion" — it means the locale of the
 * machine the code happens to be running on, which is neither of this
 * renderer's two locale channels. `useDisplayLocale`'s own doc comment names
 * this as the one thing a caller must not do, and every date, number and
 * currency renderer goes through that hook for exactly that reason.
 *
 * The harm is sharper than the percent-sign move its parent card repaired.
 * A sign changing sides is visible; a decimal separator changing is not:
 *
 *                     currency      plain
 *   de-DE (correct)   1.235 EUR     1.234,5
 *   machine(en-US)    EUR1,235      1,234.5
 *
 * A `de-DE` tenant reads `1,234.5` and parses it by German convention as
 * 1.2345 — three orders of magnitude out, on a CURRENCY TOTAL, and legible as
 * a perfectly ordinary German number the whole way.
 *
 * ── What this file measures: READ THE ROWS, NOT THE CELLS ────────────────
 * The defect is not "this cell renders the wrong bytes" — it is "this cell
 * does not move at all when the tenant locale moves". So the headline table
 * below asserts MOVEMENT: for every arm, the `de-DE` and `tr-TR` readings must
 * differ from the `en` one. Under the defect all three are the machine's
 * `en-US` and the row is flat; a per-cell snapshot suite would pass happily
 * while measuring nothing at all about the locale channel.
 *
 * ⭐ Movement alone is blind to a repair that threaded SOME varying locale
 * rather than the tenant's. That is what the agreement table is for: its
 * right-hand side is computed from the tenant tag under test in the same run,
 * so it can only pass while the tenant channel is the live one. The two tables
 * are a pair — neither is sufficient alone.
 *
 * ── The lit control ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⭐ The `colType === 'percent'` arm is ALREADY fixed (objectui#9269, landed
 * as PR objectui#9293) and is deliberately untouched by this card. It is
 * therefore the control that proves the fixture really moves the locale: it
 * moves on the unmodified base tree. **If the control row is flat, the wrapper
 * is inert and every other row in this file is NOT MEASURED — not a negative
 * answer.** Its case runs first and says so in its own name.
 *
 * ── Which rows can actually fire ────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⛔ The `en` rows are NOT controls. This measuring container's machine locale
 * is `en-US`, and `en` and `en-US` were measured to render every fixture in
 * this file identically, so an `en` row reads the same whether the tenant tag
 * arrived or not. They are overshoot detectors. The rows that MOVE — and
 * therefore the ones that measure the repair — are `de-DE` and `tr-TR`, which
 * both swap the grouping and decimal marks against `en`, and which disagree
 * with each other on where a currency symbol sits.
 *
 * ── Directions, predicted in writing BEFORE the first run ───────────────
 *   the lit control (percent column)   GREEN on the base tree — it is already fixed
 *   movement, all seven other sites    RED   on the base tree — flat rows
 *   agreement @ en, every site         GREEN on the base tree — machine is en-US
 *   agreement @ de-DE / tr-TR          RED   on the base tree
 *   tr-TR currency, absolute bytes     RED   on the base tree
 *   the prefix probes                  GREEN on the base tree
