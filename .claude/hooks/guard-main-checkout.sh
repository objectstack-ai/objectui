# guard-main-checkout.sh — PreToolUse guard enforcing AGENTS.md worktree-first rule.
# Blocks Edit / Write / NotebookEdit unless the file being edited lives in a dedicated
# git WORKTREE — not the shared primary checkout.
#
# Why: this repo (and its sibling repos) are edited by MULTIPLE agents at once. The
# shared primary checkout has its HEAD switched and its tree reset *under you*, silently
# clobbering uncommitted work. A feature branch on the shared checkout is NOT enough —
# it still gets switched under you. Only a dedicated per-task worktree is isolated.
#
# Hardened over the original guard (holes agents fell through):
#   1. Checks "am I in a linked worktree?" — not merely "branch != default". A feature
#      branch on the shared checkout no longer passes.
#   2. Checks the EDITED FILE's repo — not just $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR — so sibling repos
#      edited from this session are guarded too.
#   3. Resolves the file's nearest EXISTING ancestor dir, so creating a new file in a
#      new directory can't fail-open past the guard.
#   4. Reads the path from the key the ROUTED TOOL actually carries — a per-tool table,
#      not one hard-coded key — and blocks rather than guessing when a routed tool's
#      payload does not carry it. A guard that learns nothing from the payload and falls
#      back to judging the session's directory returns a verdict that is constant per
#      session and wrong in BOTH directions, decided by where the session happens to be
#      rooted rather than by anything about the edit.
#
# Deliberate exception (a human quick-fix that still lands via PR): OS_ALLOW_MAIN_EDITS=1.

⛔ Blocked: a $tool payload carrying no "$key" — this guard cannot tell which file is being written.

$tool is routed to this guard by .claude/settings.json, and this guard reads that tool's
path from .tool_input.$key. An absent value means the tool's input schema has moved under
the guard. Falling back to the session's directory would make the verdict a constant per
session — right or wrong purely by where the session is rooted, not by the edit — so this
blocks instead.

Fix the row for $tool in this hook's known_path_keys table, then re-run
.claude/hooks/guard-main-checkout.selftest.sh.
