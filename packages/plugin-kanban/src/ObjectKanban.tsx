 * (ADR-0079) rather than a field of its own.
 *
 * ## `''` MEANS UNSET (objectui#8308) — the one thing nothing used to say
 *
 * `cardTitle` names a record FIELD, and `''` cannot name any field, so an empty
 * string has no meaningful reading on either key: it can only be the residue of
 * an empty input — an authoring surface that writes a cleared text box back as
 * `''` instead of dropping the key, or a stored view whose kanban block
 * round-trips an unset value the same way. So `''` falls through exactly as an
 * absent key does, and `cardTitle` wins when it is NON-EMPTY. That extends the
 * precedence `index.tsx` already publishes in prose — "`cardTitle` wins when
 * both are authored" — to the single case that prose never covered, and it is
 * the ONLY reading under which the empty string is not silently taken for a
 * field name no record can have.
 *
 * ## Why this is a function and not two operators
 *
 * The two read sites — the card list's `effectiveData` memo and the
 * record-detail drawer's heading — used to spell this same fallback with two
 * DIFFERENT operators, `||` in one and `??` in the other. Those two differ on
 * exactly the falsy-but-present values, and on a string key that value is `''`,
 * so a board authored `{ cardTitle: '', titleField: 'name' }` titled its CARDS
 * from `name` while its DRAWER heading fell through to the `Record #<id>` floor:
 * one authored document, two answers to one question.
 *
 * Making the two operators agree would have repaired those two sites and left
 * the property that produced them — the pair is readable ad hoc, anywhere —
 * fully intact, so a third read site would invent a third precedence. Every
 * read of the pair goes through here instead; the source census in
 * `__tests__/ObjectKanban.titleFieldPrecedence-8308.test.tsx` reddens on a
 * property read of either key outside this function.
 *
 * Exported for unit testing and kept pure (no React), like

   * ## Why it is one arm again
   *
   * objectui#7322 item ② widened this to a two-arm union because `index.tsx`
   * registered ONE renderer under TWO keys with DIFFERENT declared node types,
   * so naming either alone made the prop lie about half the nodes the component
   * served. That note closed with a standing condition: *"⛔ Do not narrow this
   * back to one arm without first removing a registration."*
   *
   * ⇒ The registration WAS removed. objectui#8802 retired the bare `kanban`
   * node type key (maintainer ruling 2026-09-09) and `KanbanSchema` retired
   * with it, so the union's second arm no longer names anything the registry
   * dispatches here. The condition is met, and this is the narrowing it
   * authorised.
   *
   * ## What that costs, measured rather than waved past
   *
   * `ObjectKanban` reads thirteen keys off `schema`. `ObjectKanbanSchema`
   * declares `objectName`, `groupBy`, `limit`, `cardFields`, `titleField`; the
   * retired arm was the only declaration of `columns`, `cardTitle`,
   * `swimlaneField` and `grouping`. Those four now resolve through
   * {@link BaseSchema}'s `[key: string]: any` — as `filter` always has, and as
   * every one of them ALREADY did on an `object-kanban` document, which was
   * never judged by the `kanban` arm. ⇒ No `object-kanban` node changes
   * meaning; what changed is that `kanban` nodes no longer exist.
   *
   * `__tests__/object-kanban-component-props-7322.test.ts` derives the
   * registered key set from `index.tsx` off disk and goes red if the prop and
   * the registrations ever stop agreeing.

      // the object definition resolved, so that query carried no `$expand` and
      // the first paint was rendered from raw lookup ids. That half is gone —
      // the record query is now gated on the definition (see the fetch effect
      // above), so the board's own rows arrive expanded or not at all.
      //
      // The suppression is NOT thereby redundant, because unexpanded rows still
      // reach this function from sources the gate does not sit in front of:
      //
      //   1. `data` handed down by a parent. Measured, not assumed: ObjectView
      //      hosts the board this way and its own query goes out as
      //      `{ $top: 100 }` — it reads the schema through a ref that is still
      //      empty on the one run it makes, so it never injects `$expand` at
      //      all. Every card in that path is built from raw ids.
      //   2. `bind` / inline `schema.data` — author-supplied rows, expanded by
      //      nobody.
      //   3. An adapter or backend that ignores `$expand`, or a single lookup
      //      it cannot resolve (a dangling reference), which comes back as the
      //      bare id inside an otherwise expanded row.
      //
      // So the coupling the two issues share is real and stays recorded: the
      // display heuristic and the fetch ordering move together. What changed is

  // `navigation`), and made the size buckets unreachable there. Omitting both
  // leaves `resolveOverlayWidth` returning `undefined`, which is what
  // RecordDetailDrawer's own `width` default is for; that default is the
  // identical `min(960px, 60vw)`, so this is a zero-pixel change on every
  // viewport. The absent width is deliberate, not an oversight — do not
  // "restore" it. Pinned by `ObjectKanban.navWidthDefault.test.tsx`, both
  // halves, because the equivalence now depends on the drawer's default too.

  // Deliberately NOT converged on `size: 'lg'` either: that bucket is
  // `min(92vw, 960px)`, which agrees with the above only at viewport >= 1600px
  // and is up to 53% wider below it. That move is a real behaviour change, and
  // it was RULED AGAINST: objectui#6584, 2026-08-27 — stays on the CSS
  // literal; no bucket convergence. All four surfaces (gantt, kanban,
  // calendar, RecordDetailDrawer) keep today's pixels. The question is
