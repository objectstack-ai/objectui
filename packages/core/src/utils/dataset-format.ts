 * Every line of date rendering below happens in `./date-display.ts`, which is
 * where `@object-ui/fields`' `formatDate` / `formatDateTime` now live and what
 * `DateCellRenderer`, `ObjectGrid`'s date cells and `ObjectGantt`'s tooltips
 * call. Writing the date convention HERE instead is the mistake this file's
 * own header is about: objectui#4576, where a percent convention had one copy
 * in a list cell and another in this function, both correct, and a German
 * session read `1.234,5 %` in the cell beside `1.234,5%` in the measure. One
 * date convention, one home, nothing to drift.
 *
 * The date/datetime split mirrors `ObjectGantt.tsx`'s sniffed-ISO dispatch
 * verbatim, because that site is already the repo's answer to this exact
 * situation: an ISO string arriving with NO field type attached. A measure is
 * that situation by construction — the analytics result carries a column, not
 * a field definition — so the absolute locale form is taken rather than
 * `DateCellRenderer`'s `|| 'relative'` default, which is keyed on knowing the
 * value is a `date` FIELD in a row.
 *
 * ── `format` is honoured on BOTH arms, by different means (objectui#8352) ──
 * The accepted vocabulary is `'short'` and `'relative'` on EITHER arm, and
 * every other string — including `'compact'`, including a date PATTERN such as
 * `'YYYY-MM-DD'` — falls to that arm's default face. The two arms reach that
 * one vocabulary differently, and the difference is the whole of #8352:
 *
 *   - The DATE arm threads `format` onward, into `formatDate`'s positional
 *     STYLE parameter. That is the same mapping `DateCellRenderer` makes from
 *     `field.format` and the same one `plugin-dashboard`'s `recordFields`
 *     makes for a date-shaped format.
 *   - The DATETIME arm SELECTS a formatter above, because it has nothing to
 *     thread into: `formatDateTime(value, options?)` has no style parameter,
 *     so before #8352 this arm could not honour `format` even in principle —
 *     it dropped it, and `format: 'relative'` on a `Field.datetime` measure
 *     rendered the absolute face with no diagnostic.
 *
 * ⚠️ Threading `format` into `formatDateTime`'s `options.style` is NOT the fix
 * and was measured before this one was written: that key's vocabulary is
 * `'compact'` alone, so the pass-through would honour the one word the date
 * arm does NOT honour while still ignoring both words it does — the defect
 * inverted, not closed. Widening the signature was refused separately: it is a
 * published one (see {@link formatDateTime}'s note on why the positional shape
 * was refused there), and the parity #8352 asks for is reachable from the call
 * site without touching it.
 *
 * Which FACE each honoured word selects is per-arm, because the two arms
 * render different types and a datetime's own resolution is part of its datum:
 *
 *   - `'relative'` → `formatRelativeDate` on both arms, the same function, so
 *     an in-window value reads `In 2 days` in either column. Its ±7-day
 *     fallback is inherited rather than re-decided here — an out-of-window
 *     value renders the absolute DATE face on both arms. Re-deciding that
 *     window at this call site would put a second copy of the convention in
 *     this file, which is objectui#4576 exactly.
 *   - `'short'` → the dense narrow-card face of the arm's own type:
 *     `formatDate`'s `'short'` (`Sep 11, '26`) for a date, `formatDateTime`'s
 *     `'compact'` (`9/11/2026 9:30 am`) for a datetime. The datetime face
 *     keeps the time, and it is byte-identical to what every `datetime` CELL
 *     paints, so a measure tile and a grid cell showing the same instant
 *     agree — objectui#4576's rule again, in the other direction.

 * See the `format` note on {@link formatMeasure}.

/**
 * Format a MEASURE value. Currency comes from the field's declared `currency`
 * (locale-correct symbol via `Intl`), NOT from a "$" baked into the format
 * string — an amount with no declared currency must render as a plain number,
 * never a misleading "$". The numeral `format` hint (e.g. "0,0", "0.0%")
 * controls grouping / decimals / percent; it can't be baked into the row value
 * server-side (the same number feeds charts), so it is applied here.
 *
 * `locale` is the BCP-47 tag of the active display locale — in React, whatever
 * `useDisplayLocale()` returns. It is optional and LAST so every existing call
 * keeps compiling, and omitting it reproduces the previous output byte for
 * byte (the old code passed a literal `undefined` to `Intl`, which is exactly
 * what an omitted argument passes now).
 *
 * Before objectui#4566 there was no way to pass one: all three formatting sites
 * here hard-coded `undefined`, which is neither of the repo's two locale
 * channels — it is the MACHINE's locale. A German session read a KPI as
 * `1,234.5` beside a grid cell rendering the same number as `1.234,5`, and
 * inverted separators read as a different number, not an unstyled one.
 *
 * ── This routes through `formatDisplayNumber` (objectui#4576) ──
 * It did not always. #4566 measured the option mapping across 32,760
 * value × format × currency × percentScale × locale combinations and found it
 * LOSSLESS — routing changes no byte of output, because the policy layer
 * `formatDisplayNumber` adds over plain `Intl` is grouping suppression keyed on
 * a field's declared `scale`, and a measure has no `scale` to feed it (decimals
 * here come from a numeral format PATTERN, so grouping stays on and the two
 * agree everywhere). What blocked it was the PACKAGE BOUNDARY: the formatter
 * lived in `@object-ui/i18n`, which depends on `i18next`/`react-i18next` and
 * peer-depends on React, while this package is the React-free engine (AGENTS.md
 * §3: "No UI-lib deps. Logic only.") and a runtime dependency of React-FREE
 * consumers — the `object-ui` VS Code extension and `@object-ui/data-objectstack`.
 *
 * #4576 removed the boundary rather than working around it: `formatDisplayNumber`
 * is pure, so it moved DOWN into this package (`./number-display.ts`) and
 * `@object-ui/i18n` re-exports it. The duplicate implementation this file used
 * to carry is gone, and with it the drift that duplicate produced — see the
 * percent note in the body, and {@link percentDisplayValue}'s promise, which
 * is true again.
 *
 * ── Date-valued measures (objectui#7178) ──
 * `min` / `max` over a date or datetime field is a legitimate measure, and it
 * used to render its stored value verbatim: the guard above returned
 * `String(v)` for anything non-numeric BEFORE `format` was read, so a KPI tile
 * showed `2026-07-04T07:00:00.000Z` in `text-2xl` and wrapped it over two
 * lines. A date-shaped value now routes through {@link formatMeasureDate} to
 * the display path list cells use; nothing about the numeric path moved.
 *
 * ⚠️ What `format` can and cannot say for those values, measured rather than
 * assumed, and stated PER ARM — a date-shaped measure takes one of two arms in
 * {@link formatMeasureDate}, and this paragraph used to describe only one of
 * them while reading as though it described both. That cost a card: an
 * objectui triage pass read the undifferentiated claim, concluded the defect
 * was already fixed, and downgraded objectui#8352, which a driven browser run
 * then refuted. The two arms agree TODAY, but only because #8352 made them; a
 * universal sentence here is what hid the disagreement before, so it is not
 * coming back even now that it would be true.
 *
 * The shared date path takes a named STYLE, not a date pattern. On BOTH arms
 * the honoured vocabulary is `'short'` and `'relative'`:
 *
 *   - `Field.date` (`2026-09-08`) — honoured by threading `format` into
 *     `formatDate`'s style parameter. The same words `DateCellRenderer`
 *     honours from `field.format` for the same field.
 *   - `Field.datetime` (`2026-09-01T00:00:00.000Z`) — honoured by SELECTING a
 *     formatter, because `formatDateTime` has no style parameter to thread
 *     into (objectui#8352). Before that card this arm honoured NOTHING: it
 *     dropped `format` entirely, so `'relative'` rendered the absolute face.
 *
 * Every other string falls to that arm's default face — a PATTERN like
 * `format: 'YYYY-MM-DD'` is accepted by the schema, reaches this function, and
 * renders the locale default, and so does `'compact'`, which is
 * `formatDateTime`'s own vocabulary but not this path's. The pattern part is
 * not new behaviour introduced here: `plugin-dashboard`'s `recordFields`
 * already routes a date-shaped `format` into the same style slot and gets the
 * same locale default. Closing it would mean teaching the shared path a
 * pattern grammar, which is a change to the path itself and to every list cell
 * that reads it — not a measure concern, and not either card.
 *
 * ⚠️ `'relative'` renders the ABSOLUTE face for a value more than ±7 days from
 * today, on both arms, by `formatRelativeDate`'s own design. That is correct
 * output, not a regression — but it also means an out-of-window value is
 * useless for testing this path, because it renders identically whether
 * `format` is honoured or dropped. Both readings that missed #8352 were taken
 * on 40–60-day-old data.

/**
 * Build the record-list filter for a drilled dataset bucket (ADR-0021 D2).
 *
 * Each drillable dimension maps to its underlying object field, filtered by the
 * dimension's RAW grouped value (from the server's parallel `drillRawRows`, NOT
 * the visible row which carries the display LABEL — a select/lookup label would
 * mis-filter). The render-time `runtimeFilter` is ANDed in so the drilled list
 * stays within the same slice the aggregate was computed over.
 *
 * ## What the EMPTY bucket means, and why it is spelled `{ $null: true }`
 *
 * A drill must return exactly the rows the clicked bucket COUNTED. The empty
 * bucket is the one the aggregate grouped rows with NO VALUE for that dimension
 * into, so the drill means "this dimension has no value" — NOT "this dimension
 * holds the literal value null". Those are different row sets, and the
 * difference is measurable rather than theoretical: against `ValueDataSource`'s
 * matcher over rows `{owner:'alice'}` / `{owner:null}` / `{}` (no `owner` key),
 * `['owner','is_null',true]` selects the explicit-null row AND the missing-key
 * row, while an equality test against `null` selects only the explicit-null one
 * and drops the row that has no `owner` at all. The bucket counted both, so
 * is-null is the one that agrees with the number the user clicked.
 *
 * ⇒ every empty authoring — `''`, `null` and `undefined` alike — becomes ONE
 * spelling, `{ [field]: { $null: true } }`, which `convertFiltersToAST` lowers
 * to `[field, 'is_null', true]`. The three are not told apart because the
 * server already merged them into the single bucket the user clicked; there is
 * no second bucket here for a second spelling to address.
 *
 * ⚠️ This value used to be a bare `null`, and that is the defect objectui#9085
 * records: `convertFiltersToAST`'s OLDEST pinned behaviour is to SKIP a key
 * whose value is `null` / `undefined` (pinned as "should skip null and
 * undefined values"), so the constraint was dropped on the way to the wire and
 * the empty-bucket drill answered with a SUPERSET — every row, silently. The
 * repair is here at the PRODUCER and ⛔ not at that converter: the skip is
 * relied on by other producers, and changing it would move every caller's
 * meaning at once (objectui#9020 ruled it stays). `$null` is not a new
 * vocabulary either — it is a declared spec operator this dialect already
 * lowers, and the one spelling that says the same thing on BOTH of
 * `ValueDataSource`'s routes, where a bare `null` said "only an explicit null"
 * on the plain-object route and "no constraint at all" on the AST route.
 *
 * ⚠️ Known BOUNDARY, unchanged by this and deliberately not widened: the drill
 * "escape hatch" (the host's `openRecordList`, which serializes a drill filter
 * into `filter[...]` URL params) has NO spelling for is-null — its operator
 * vocabulary is equality plus four range bounds — so it drops this condition
 * exactly as it already dropped the bare `null`, byte-for-byte the same query
 * string. That surface is a superset today and stays one; closing it needs a
 * URL-dialect operator on both the write and the read side, which is its own
 * card.
 *
 * A time-bucketed date dimension (#1752) drills by RANGE, not equality — a
 * humanized bucket ("2026-Q2") can't be exact-matched, so the server sends a
 * half-open `[gte, lt)` per date dim in `rawRanges` instead of a raw value.
 * Each becomes an ObjectQL range operator object (`{ $gte, $lt }`) so the drill
 * scopes the list to the clicked time bucket instead of every bucket (which the
 * old date-dim skip degraded to — a superset).
 *
 * ## The widget filter is CONJOINED, not spread (objectui#9137)
 *
 * ⛔ `runtimeFilter` is composed through {@link composeDrillFilter}, never by
 * spreading it into the object literal below. Spreading is correct only for the
 * OBJECT arm; this parameter's declared producer sends the ARRAY arm. The
 * dashboard's `DashboardWidgetSchema.filter` docblock states it outright —
 * "objectui passes an ObjectQL FilterNode array here, not the spec's
 * `FilterCondition` envelope" — and `DatasetWidget`'s guard admits it
 * (`typeof [] === 'object'` and `Object.keys(['x']).length === 1` are both
 * true), so the array arm reached this line unfiltered. Spreading an ARRAY
 * yields INDEX keys: `[['region','=','emea']]` became
 * `{ '0': ['region','=','emea'] }`, which is not a condition anyone can honour.
 *
 * ⚠️ MEASURED, and it is NOT the silent superset the sibling sites had. An
 * index key is not dropped on the way to the wire — every sink in circulation
 * refuses it LOUDLY, because a bare array is not a legal equality comparand
 * (objectui#8530 / objectui#8514): `convertFiltersToAST` THROWS
 * `FilterOperatorError`, `driver-sql` answers `400 INVALID_FILTER`, and
 * `ValueDataSource`'s matcher selects NOTHING. Against rows scoped
 * `region = 'emea'`, drilling the `stage = 'won'` bucket returned `(none)`
 * where the widget alone returned three rows and the conjunction returns the
 * right two. So the widget's conditions were not merely lost — the drill was
 * dead in the array arm. The failure is fail-CLOSED here, and this is the third
 * site of the class objectui#8944 (chart) and objectui#9024 (pivot) removed.
 *
 * Three properties of THIS site, each confirmed rather than assumed — it is not
 * a copy-paste of the other two:
 *
 * 1. The return stays a NON-optional `Record<string, unknown>`, because callers
 *    do not expect `undefined`. `composeDrillFilter` answers `undefined` when
 *    both sources are empty, so that one case is spelled `?? {}` — the same
 *    empty object this function already returned for a bucket with no dims.
 * 2. Range operators SURVIVE. A time-bucketed dim contributes
 *    `{ $gte, $lt }`, and the composition re-spells it as two `$and` children
 *    on the same field (`[{d:{$gte}},{d:{$lt}}]`) rather than losing a bound;
 *    the selected rows are identical, and `serializeDrillFilterParams` walks
 *    `$and` (objectui#8944) so both bounds still reach `filter[d][gte|lt]`.
 * 3. `runtimeFilter` is declared `unknown`, which is what the two consumers
 *    actually hand it — `any` from the dashboard, `Record<string, unknown>`
 *    from `DatasetReportRenderer`. Widening the PARAMETER is what admits both
 *    without a cast; ⛔ neither consumer's own type is changed by this.
 *
 * ⚠️ Conjunction changes one behaviour deliberately: a field named by BOTH the
 * widget filter and the clicked bucket used to be overwritten by the bucket,
 * and now both conditions apply. That is the point — a drill may narrow the
 * widget's scope and may never widen it — and it is the posture the chart and
 * pivot sites already ship.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Only the COMPOSING leg moves; the identity leg is left byte-identical
 *
 * The sink is asked only when there IS a second source. That is this site's
 * one departure from `ObjectChart` / `ObjectPivotTable`, which call it
 * unconditionally, and it is deliberate rather than a shortcut: the spread
 * this replaces only ever ran when `runtimeFilter` was present, so the
 * no-widget-filter path carries no defect to repair.
 *
 * ⚠️ Routing it anyway was MEASURED and rejected. `composeDrillFilter`'s own
 * note — "a lone surviving source lowers back to exactly the flat object the
 * spread produced" — holds only for a source of ONE condition; with two it
 * lowers to `$and`, because `convertFiltersToAST` emits one node per condition
 * and `parseFilterAST` cannot fold two nodes back onto one key. A `{ $gte,
 * $lt }` range is two conditions on its own, so even a single date bucket
 * re-spells. Sending the identity leg through the sink therefore re-shaped
 * every multi-condition dataset drill — including the controls objectui#9085,
 * objectui#4056, objectstack#5473 and #1752 pin on paths this card does not
 * touch — for ZERO change in the rows selected or the `filter[...]` params
 * emitted. ⛔ Do not "simplify" this to an unconditional call without redoing
 * that measurement.
 *
 * Shared by the dashboard `DatasetWidget` and the report renderer so a drill
 * filters identically (and correctly, including lookups) on both surfaces.
