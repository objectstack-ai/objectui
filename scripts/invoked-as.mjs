/**
 * invoked-as -- the ONE answer to "was this module run, or imported?"
 *
 *   node scripts/invoked-as.mjs --self-test
 *
 * Every CLI script in `scripts/` has to separate "node ran me" from "something
 * imported me" before it decides whether to do anything. Left to a hand-typed
 * comparison of `process.argv[1]` against `import.meta.url`, those answers
 * drift: in the objectstack tree this module was ported FROM (#5984) they had
 * reached ELEVEN distinct spellings across 33 files -- measured, not estimated
 * -- and nine of the eleven were wrong, in a direction nothing in CI can see.
 *
 * THIS repository has since been swept, and a gate here enforces the rule. Read
 * "## What enforces this, and what it took to get here" below for the numbers
 * and the commit they were taken on. Two paths this header names are
 * objectstack's and do not exist here; each is labelled where it appears.
 *
 * ## The bug every hand-typed spelling had
 *
 * **Node resolves symlinks for the module graph but leaves `process.argv[1]`
 * as the caller typed it.** Reach a script through a symlink and the two name
 * different paths, the guard answers `false`, and the script does NOTHING --
 * with exit 0 and no output.
 *
 * That is the silent-success direction this tree treats as worse than no check
 * at all. The CI wrappers spawn these tools and hold `result.status` only, so
 * an inert child is a GREEN gate. Measured HERE, on a real blocking gate, with
 * one guide file made deliberately wrong so that the direct run is RED:
 *
 *   node scripts/check-skills-paths.mjs
 *     direct  : exit=1, 696 bytes naming the dead path and how to fix it
 *     symlink : exit=0, no output at all
 *
 * Same tree, same defect, same gate -- reached through a symlink it reports the
 * clean answer, and a wrapper holding `result.status` cannot tell that apart
 * from a pass. `check-skills-paths.mjs` CARRIED the no-realpath spelling when
 * that was measured, as did 27 of its neighbours; every one of them routes
 * through `isEntrypoint` now -- see below for what closed them, and what keeps
 * them shut.
 *
 * The same measurement in objectstack, where this module came from, lands on a
 * gate whose exit codes make it worse still: `scripts/pm/check-governed-merges.mjs`
 * prints "GOVERNED -- no seat arms auto-merge" with exit 3 directly and exits 0
 * with no output through a symlink -- and its `EXIT_TEST_NOT_GOVERNED` is also
 * 0, so the two opposite verdicts collapse to one status and a seat reading the
 * status gets a clearance to arm auto-merge from a tool that never ran. That
 * file and that directive number are objectstack's; neither exists here.
 *
 * ## The two other directions the copies failed in
 *
 * **Basename matching** -- `import.meta.url.endsWith(argv[1].split('/').pop())`
 * and `argv[1].endsWith('qa-rollup.mjs')`. These survive a symlink that keeps
 * the basename, so they look fine, but they answer TRUE for ANY entry script
 * sharing the basename: they fire on IMPORT. The failure is the opposite
 * direction -- a module that runs its whole CLI inside someone else's process.
 *
 * **Percent-encoding** -- `new URL(import.meta.url).pathname === argv[1]`
 * compares an ENCODED pathname against a raw argv, and
 * ``new URL(`file://${argv[1]}`)`` bypasses the encoder `pathToFileURL`
 * applies. Both go inert on any checkout path containing a character that
 * needs encoding, with no symlink involved at all. Measured: a `#` in any
 * parent directory name is enough.
 *
 * ## The shape that survives
 *
 * Two comparisons. The plain `resolve` equality is the fast path and answers
 * the ordinary case. The `realpath` comparison is the half that keeps a
 * checkout REACHED THROUGH A SYMLINK from reading as "imported". It falls back
 * to `false` rather than throwing -- an entry path that cannot be read is not
 * this module.
 *
 * Comparing resolved PATHS (never URL strings) is what keeps percent-encoding
 * out of the answer entirely: there is no encoder to disagree about.
 *
 * ## Why callers should reach for `isEntrypoint`, not `invokedAs`
 *
 * `isEntrypoint(import.meta.url)` takes ONE argument and reads `process.argv`
 * itself, so a call site has nothing left to spell wrongly -- no `argv[1]`, no
 * `fileURLToPath`, no comparison. `invokedAs` is the testable core underneath
 * it, exported so the predicate is pinned by cases rather than trusted by
 * reading.
 *
 * ## What enforces this, and what it took to get here
 *
 * `scripts/check-entry-guard.mjs` enforces the rule: a `process.argv[1]` in an
 * entry-guard position anywhere in `scripts/**` outside this module is a
 * failure. It is wired in `package.json` as `check:entry-guard` and run by
 * `.github/workflows/lint.yml` BEFORE `pnpm install`, so an install failure
 * cannot take the gate down with it. `scripts/__tests__/entry-guard-wiring.test.ts`
 * pins that wiring rather than the numbers, because a gate nobody runs is
 * indistinguishable from a gate that passes.
 *
 * Measured on `2dc4aa709`. Naming the commit is the point: these are a
 * SNAPSHOT, and an older snapshot left standing in the present tense is exactly
 * what this section had to be rewritten to fix.
 *
 *   pnpm check:entry-guard                      -> 47 scripts/ files scanned, no
 *                                                  guard outside the baseline;
 *                                                  0 still hand-type one
 *                                                  (SHRINK-ONLY); 42 export
 *                                                  bindings, 42 inert on import
 *   git grep -l 'isEntrypoint' -- scripts       -> 40 files
 *   git grep -l 'process.argv\[1\]' -- scripts   -> 3 files
 *
 * Those three are this module -- the one place allowed to read `argv[1]` -- and
 * `check-entry-guard.mjs` and `js-comment-mask.mjs`, which carry the broken
 * spellings as FIXTURE data rather than as guards; the gate's comment/string
 * masking is what tells those apart from the real thing.
 *
 * The history, because the figures above only mean something against it. This
 * module arrived from objectstack (#5984) with prose describing OBJECTSTACK'S
 * tree: it named a gate that did not exist here and a sweep that had not
 * happened here. Measured then, on `7c96c9420`: `check-entry-guard` appeared in
 * exactly ONE place, the paragraph claiming it; `isEntrypoint` had a single
 * adopter (`scripts/pm/check-half-states.mjs`); and 29 hand-typed guards stood
 * in NINE textually distinct spellings, 28 of them with no realpath leg --
 * including the exact percent-encoding spelling this header warns about above,
 * then still in `check-node-esm-load.mjs`. objectui#6092 closed both halves:
 * the gate landed (#6133), the 29 call sites were converted (#6145), and the
 * second rule's baseline reached zero (#6156).
 *
 * The gate, not the sweep, is what holds. A one-time sweep starts rotting the
 * day it merges, because nothing stops a THIRTIETH spelling from being typed
 * next week; `KNOWN_HAND_TYPED_GUARDS` is empty and SHRINK-ONLY, so typing one
 * is now RED rather than a convention politely ignored.
 *
 * When these numbers move, re-take them and re-name the commit -- do not edit
 * the figures in place under the old one. A refreshed count under a stale
 * commit is a measurement nobody can reproduce, and that is the failure this
 * whole section records.
 *
 * ## The siblings, and why the duplication is deliberate
 *
 * objectstack's `packages/cli/src/utils/invocation.ts` exports `isProcessEntry`,
 * the same predicate for the same reason (its header cites this defect). Note
 * the repo: objectui's `packages/cli` has no such util, and `isProcessEntry`
 * appears nowhere in this tree, so the pairing below is a CROSS-REPO obligation
 * rather than a local one.
 *
 * Why the copies are not collapsed into one: `scripts/` runs as plain .mjs
 * against a possibly-unbuilt tree, and making the whole tooling layer depend on
 * a package build to answer "was I run?" trades this bug for a worse one.
 *
 * The duplication is therefore structural, but DIVERGENCE is not allowed -- two
 * predicates answering this question differently is precisely the defect being
 * closed. All three copies carry the same two legs: realpath for symlinks, and
 * directory resolution for `node <dir>`. Change one, change the others.
