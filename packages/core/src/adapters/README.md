# Data Source Adapters

This directory holds the `DataSource` adapters that ship **inside
`@object-ui/core`** — the backend-agnostic ones, with no external SDK
dependency. They are what a schema's `viewData` block resolves to at runtime.

> **Looking for the ObjectStack adapter?** It is not in this directory.
> `ObjectStackAdapter` / `createObjectStackAdapter` ship as their own package,
> **[`@object-ui/data-objectstack`](../../../data-objectstack/README.md)**,
> whose README owns the ObjectStack material — connection handling, metadata
> caching, error hierarchy, and the filter-operator and query-parameter
> translation tables.

## Available Adapters

Every export below is re-exported from the package root, so consumers import
them from `@object-ui/core`.

| Export | Kind | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ApiDataSource` | class | `provider: 'api'` — raw HTTP against the `HttpRequest` configs carried in `ViewData` |
| `ValueDataSource` | class | `provider: 'value'` — an in-memory array; no network at all |
| `resolveDataSource` | function | builds the adapter a `ViewData` config asks for (`object` / `api` / `value`) |
| `runBatchTransaction` / `emulateBatchTransaction` | functions | ordered cross-object save — the adapter's own `batchTransaction` when it has one, a sequential non-atomic emulation when it does not |

Backend-specific adapters live in their own packages rather than here; today
that is `@object-ui/data-objectstack`.

### `ApiDataSource`

For `provider: 'api'`. The endpoint comes from the `HttpRequest` configs, not
from the `resource` argument — `find`/`findOne` use `read`, and
`create`/`update`/`delete` use `write` (falling back to `read` when `write` is
absent). `QueryParams` are flattened onto the query string.

```typescript
import { ApiDataSource } from '@object-ui/core';

const dataSource = new ApiDataSource({
  read: { url: 'https://api.example.com/users', method: 'GET' },
  write: { url: 'https://api.example.com/users' },
  defaultHeaders: { Authorization: 'Bearer …' },
  // fetch: customFetch,   // optional; defaults to globalThis.fetch
});

const { data, total } = await dataSource.find('users', { $top: 20 });
```

A generic HTTP endpoint exposes no metadata, so `getObjectSchema()` returns a
minimal stub (`{ name, fields: {} }`) and `getView()` / `getApp()` return
`null` — enough that schema-dependent components do not crash.

### `ValueDataSource`

For `provider: 'value'`. Everything runs against an in-memory array, which is
deep-cloned on construction so the caller's array is never mutated. Useful for
static content, fixtures, and previews.

The clone is a **`structuredClone`**, not a JSON round-trip (objectui#9175). It
is an aliasing barrier and nothing more: `ViewData.items` is
`z.array(z.unknown())` in `@objectstack/spec`, so **an inline row does not have
to be serializable** (objectui#6018). A `Date` arrives as a `Date`, a key whose
value is `undefined` keeps its key, `Map` / `Set` / `RegExp` / `BigInt` /
`NaN` / a cyclic record graph all survive as themselves. What
`structuredClone` cannot copy — a function, a DOM node — throws
`DataCloneError` at construction: **loud, on purpose**, and there is no
fallback to the round-trip, because a fallback would restore the silent
flattening this replaced.

```typescript
import { ValueDataSource } from '@object-ui/core';

const dataSource = new ValueDataSource({
  items: [
    { id: '1', name: 'Alice', age: 30 },
    { id: '2', name: 'Bob', age: 24 },
  ],
  // idField: 'id',   // optional; defaults to `id`, then `_id`
});

const { data, total } = await dataSource.find('people', {
  $filter: { age: { $gte: 25 } },
  $orderby: { name: 'asc' },
});
```

It implements `$filter` (both MongoDB-style objects and FilterNode AST arrays),
`$search`, `$orderby`, `$skip`, `$top` and `$select` locally, plus `bulk()`,
`aggregate()` and `onMutation()`. `getAll()` returns a cloned snapshot — the
same `structuredClone` rule as the constructor — and `count` the current
length.

#### What `$filter` executes, and what it refuses

`find()` picks a matcher on the SHAPE of `$filter` — a FilterNode **array** goes
to the AST matcher, an **object** to the `$`-dialect matcher — and since
objectui#8447 the two answer the same question and refuse in the same way.

The object dialect executes one arm per member of the spec's `FILTER_OPERATORS`:

```text
$eq  $ne  $gt  $gte  $lt  $lte  $in  $nin  $between
$contains  $icontains  $notContains  $startsWith  $endsWith  $null  $exists
```

That is **all sixteen** — nothing the spec declares is refused by name.

`$contains`, `$notContains`, `$startsWith` and `$endsWith` are **case-sensitive**;
`$icontains` is the one case-insensitive member, its fold is **ASCII-only**, and its
comparand must be a **non-empty string** — any other comparand shape is refused in the
table below rather than folded (objectui#8748).
`$null` takes its direction from the value: `$null: true` is IS NULL, `$null: false`
is IS NOT NULL. `$exists` is its exact inverse — `$exists: true` is IS NOT NULL — which
is the lowering `convertFiltersToAST` already performs, not a reading invented here.

A stored value that is **not a string** never satisfies `$contains`, `$icontains`,
`$startsWith` or `$endsWith`, and always satisfies `$notContains` — the number `5`
does not contain the substring `"5"`, so it is on the negation side. That is
objectstack#14079 (maintainer ruling 2026-09-05, option A), and it is what makes the
operator and its negation a **partition**: before objectui#8452 both arms carried the
type test, so a numeric column answered NO to `$notContains` as well and those rows
appeared in no filter answer at all. The stored value is never coerced to text —
searching `String(50)` would answer a query nobody wrote, in a spelling the storage
class chose. A `null` and an absent key take the same side of the same predicate.

#### Grouped filters — `$and` and `$or`

Both are **executed** in the object dialect (objectui#8513), matching the
semantics the five platform backends already answer to. A group is one ENTRY of
the condition object, so it ANDs with its sibling keys:
`{ status: 'open', $or: [ … ] }` is "status AND the group". Groups nest.

The empty-group answers are the **boolean identity elements** ruled by
objectstack#5322 — and they are not a special case in the code, they are what
`Array.prototype.every` and `Array.prototype.some` already answer for an empty
array:

| filter | rows | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{ $and: [] }` | **every** row | the AND identity is TRUE |
| `{ $or: [] }` | **no** row | the OR identity is FALSE |
| `{ $or: [ … , {} ] }` | **every** row | a `{}` branch is a TRUE disjunct and absorbs its `$or` |
| `{ $and: [ … , {} ] }` | the other branches | a `{}` branch drops out of an `$and` |

The identities matter in practice because `convertFiltersToAST` hands them back
**unlowered** — it returns the original object when a filter reduces to no
conditions — so `{ $and: [] }` reaches this matcher as an object even from
callers that lower everything else. Before objectui#8513 it answered zero rows
for a filter whose ruled answer is every row.

This is pinned against the spec's own cross-backend table
(`FILTER_LOGIC_CASES`), not against a local fixture, in
`ValueDataSource.filterLogicConformance-8513.test.ts`. A malformed group — a
non-array `$and`, or a member that is not a condition object — is refused like
anything else below.

Anything else is **refused**: the row is excluded and the reason is logged once per
distinct refusal per `find()` — never passed through as "no constraint", which is
what an unrecognised operator used to mean here. Refused on purpose, each with a
prescription in the message:

| spelling | why | write instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$like` / `$ilike` | declared, but staged out of `FILTER_OPERATORS`; no pattern engine in memory | `$contains` / `$icontains` |
| `$regex` / `$options` | retired from the protocol | `$icontains` |
| `$startswith`, `$notcontains`, `$notin`, `$ncontains` | non-canonical spellings | the camelCase spelling |
| `$not` | ruled upstream (objectstack#5146), but this repo's own `convertFiltersToAST` still refuses it: the AST has no negation keyword and rewriting the negation inward is silently partial | `$ne` / `$nin` / `$notContains` |
| `{ relation: { field: … } }` | this matcher does not descend into relations | filter on the stored key |
| an **array** comparand outside `$in` / `$nin` / `$between` | the spec leaves it unruled and the sibling in-memory matcher refuses it; a reference comparison excluded every row, and on `$ne` selected every row (objectui#8514) | `{ field: { $in: [ … ] } }` |
| an **empty** or **non-string** `$icontains` / `icontains` comparand | `FILTER_TEXT_CASES` carries both as REJECTION rows — an empty comparand constrains nothing, a coerced one answers a query nobody wrote (objectui#8748) | a non-empty string comparand, or drop the condition |
| `{ $field }` in an `$in` / `$nin` member or a `$between` endpoint | removed from those positions because no backend resolved one (objectstack#7596) | a scalar comparison |
| `{ $field, addDays }` | the offset is defined against the column's temporal class, which this schema-less matcher cannot read (objectstack#14104) | shift the value at the producer |
| `{ $field: 'a.b' }` (dotted) | this matcher addresses a flat record, so a dotted reference would not mean what a dotted field name means | a same-record column |
| `{ field: { $field: … } }` (implicit) | reads as an operator named `$field`, not a comparand (objectstack#7597) | `{ field: { $eq: { $field: … } } }` |

#### Cross-field comparands

A `{ $field: 'other_column' }` comparand is **executed**, in both dialects, as the
whole comparand of the six scalar comparisons (`$eq` `$ne` `$gt` `$gte` `$lt`
`$lte` and their AST spellings) — the positions `FieldReferenceSchema` declares
it for. It resolves against the record being matched, so
`{ amount: { $lte: { $field: 'budget' } } }` selects the rows whose `amount` is
within their own `budget` (objectui#8515). Every other position is refused, in
the rows above.

### `resolveDataSource`

Turns a `ViewData` config into a concrete adapter. This is the function a
renderer calls; components do not branch on `provider` themselves.

```typescript
import { resolveDataSource } from '@object-ui/core';

const dataSource = resolveDataSource(
  { provider: 'api', read: { url: '/api/users' } },
  contextDataSource, // used for `provider: 'object'`, and as the fallback
);
```

| `viewData.provider` | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `'object'` | the `fallback` — the `DataSource` from context, typically `ObjectStackAdapter` |
| `'api'` | a new `ApiDataSource` built from `read` / `write` |
| `'value'` | a new `ValueDataSource` over `items` |
| unknown, or no `viewData` | the `fallback`, else `null` |

### `runBatchTransaction` / `emulateBatchTransaction`

The single entry point for an ordered **cross-object** save (the master-detail
case). `runBatchTransaction` calls the adapter's native `batchTransaction` when
it implements one — `ObjectStackAdapter` does, and against a backend
advertising `capabilities.transactionalBatch` that is a real server
transaction — and otherwise falls back to `emulateBatchTransaction`. Callers
stay ignorant of which one ran.

```typescript
import { runBatchTransaction } from '@object-ui/core';

// `{ $ref: 0 }` resolves to the id minted by operation 0 (the parent).
await runBatchTransaction(dataSource, [
  { object: 'invoice',      action: 'create', data: { no: 'INV-1' } },
  { object: 'invoice_line', action: 'create', data: { invoice: { $ref: 0 }, amount: 10 } },
]);
```

⚠️ The emulation is **not** atomic. It runs the operations in order and, on
failure, best-effort deletes the records it created (children before parent)
before rethrowing; updates and deletes that already ran cannot be undone, and a
create's side effects (hooks, rollups, webhooks) are not undone by a later
delete. It exists so a save is still possible against a backend without server
atomicity — see
[`@object-ui/data-objectstack`](../../../data-objectstack/README.md#cross-object-atomic-batch-batchtransaction)
for the capability negotiation that decides which path is taken.

## Creating Custom Adapters

To create a custom adapter, implement the `DataSource<T>` interface:

```typescript
import type { DataSource, QueryParams, QueryResult } from '@object-ui/types';

export class MyCustomAdapter<T = any> implements DataSource<T> {
  async find(resource: string, params?: QueryParams): Promise<QueryResult<T>> {
    // Your implementation
  }
  
  async findOne(resource: string, id: string | number): Promise<T | null> {
    // Your implementation
  }
  
  async create(resource: string, data: Partial<T>): Promise<T> {
    // Your implementation
  }
  
  async update(resource: string, id: string | number, data: Partial<T>): Promise<T> {
    // Your implementation
  }
  
  async delete(resource: string, id: string | number): Promise<boolean> {
    // Your implementation
  }
  
  // Optional: bulk operations
  async bulk?(resource: string, operation: string, data: Partial<T>[]): Promise<T[]> {
    // Your implementation
  }
}
```
