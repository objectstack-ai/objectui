/**
 * Declarative local patches for the regenerated Shadcn primitives.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `packages/components/src/ui/**` is a No-Touch zone (AGENTS.md Commandment
 * #7): every file in it is overwritten by `pnpm shadcn:update` from the
 * upstream registry. That is fine for the 99% of those files we take as-is,
 * and `shadcn-sync.js` already protects hand edits *defensively* — it counts
 * `localOnlyLines` and REFUSES to overwrite a diverged file.
 *
 * Refusal is not enough for a patch that must never silently disappear:
 *
 *   1. `--force` bypasses the refusal by design, and takes the edit with it.
 *   2. A type-check cannot see the loss. Upstream drops a local addition *and*
 *      its usages consistently, so the regenerated file still compiles — this
 *      is the `command.tsx` failure mode documented in `shadcn-sync.js`.
 *   3. Nothing declares WHICH lines were load-bearing, so a reviewer staring
 *      at a post-sync diff has no way to tell a deliberate fix from drift.
 *
 * So the edits that MUST survive regeneration are declared here as data, and
 * the sync script re-applies them on every write. The patch is no longer a
 * hand edit someone has to remember to re-do; it is part of what "sync" means.
 *
 * ## Declared = enforced
 *
 * Every patch carries `marker` (what the patched file must contain) and
 * `find`/`occurrences` (the upstream anchor it needs). That makes three
 * different regressions loud instead of silent:
 *
 *   - `verifyLocalPatches()` — the file on disk lost its marker (a forced
 *     sync, a bad merge, a hand edit). Offline, so it can gate every PR.
 *   - `applyLocalPatches()` on freshly fetched upstream — the anchor is gone
 *     or has moved, i.e. the patch will NOT survive the next regeneration.
 *     `shadcn:check` reports this before anyone runs `--update`.
 *   - `applyLocalPatches()` during `--update` — same, and the write is
 *     refused rather than producing a file with the patch quietly missing.
 *
 * ## Adding a patch
 *
 * Keep the payload OUT of `src/ui/`. A patch should be a one-line reference to
 * code that lives somewhere the sync never touches (here: `src/lib/`), because
 * a small anchored reference survives upstream churn far better than an
 * inlined implementation, and the implementation itself stays reviewable and
 * unit-testable in a normal file.
 *
 * Write `find` from REGISTRY bytes, never from `src/ui/**`. The local file is
 * the patched artefact, so any line an earlier local edit left there reads as a
 * perfectly good anchor: it matches the file in front of you and matches
 * nothing upstream, which makes the patch dead on arrival while looking
 * correct. objectui#4976 is the worked example. The round-trip assertion in
 * `scripts/__tests__/shadcn-local-patches.test.ts` is what holds a new anchor
 * to this rule offline, without a network round-trip.

/**
 * The slider thumb pass-through patch (objectui#3318).
 *
 * A Radix slider's focusable control is the THUMB (`span[role="slider"]`,
 * `tabindex="0"`) — the element a keyboard user lands on and the one assistive
 * technology reads state from. `Slider.Root` renders a role-less wrapper span
 * and takes every unrecognised prop, so a host's `id` / `aria-invalid` /
 * `aria-describedby` / `aria-labelledby` landed on a wrapper nobody visits:
 * a required slider showed its red message with nothing announced, its visible
 * label pointed `for` at an id no element carried, and its help text had zero
 * consumers.
 *
 * The primitive exports only `Slider`, so unlike `SelectTrigger` (objectui#3306,
 * the same defect one step easier) a widget has NO handle on the element that
 * must carry those facts. Hence a declared `thumbProps`.
 *
 * Four patches. Three are one-liners; the delivery half expands upstream's
 * single-line self-closing Thumb into the multi-line form that can carry the
 * routed props. As with the families above, the payload stays OUT of
 * `src/ui/`: the routing and its reasoning live in
 * `packages/components/src/lib/slider-thumb.ts`.
 *
 * The root half is patched too, and that is not optional: leaving `thumbProps`
 * in Root's spread would stringify it onto the wrapper (`thumbprops="[object
 * Object]"`), the exact leak objectui#3291 sweeps for.
 *
 * ## The delivery anchor was re-targeted once (objectui#4976)
 *
 * As first declared, the delivery patch anchored the line that forwarded the
 * host's accessible name onto the thumb — a line objectui added by hand in
 * commit a014bc00c ("fix Slider accessibility", 2026-04-13), NOT a line the
 * registry has ever served. Upstream renders the thumb with a className and
 * nothing else, and slider's own `localEdits` entry in `shadcn-components.json`
 * said exactly that the whole time. So the anchor matched the file on disk and
 * could never match upstream: the first `--check` after it landed reported the
 * patch unappliable (`found 0x`) while the shipped file was perfectly correct.
 *
 * Re-targeting it moved the anchor only — the payload, and therefore every byte
 * of the shipped primitive's behaviour, is untouched.

/**
 * The sheet `hideOverlay` patch (objectui#6090).
 *
 * `SheetContent` renders `<SheetOverlay />` unconditionally upstream, which
 * dims and pointer-blocks everything behind the drawer. A non-modal sheet —
 * one whose host page must stay clickable while it is open — needs the
 * backdrop suppressed, so objectui added an optional `hideOverlay` prop.
 *
 * ## Why this is declared rather than left as a documented hand edit
 *
 * It was a hand edit for months, recorded only in `shadcn-components.json`,
 * and objectui#6090 measured what that actually bought: nothing. The
 * protection it was credited with was a type error at the call sites a
 * `--force` sync would break — and there are no call sites in this repo (still
 * none, re-measured on `main` at 0c282d979). `hideOverlay` is OPTIONAL, so a
 * sync that dropped it would type-check clean and the prop would vanish
 * silently.
 *
 * `@object-ui/components` is PUBLISHED, though, so "no call sites" is a
 * statement about this repository and not about the population that would
 * break. Retiring the prop on the strength of an in-repo grep would be a
 * breaking change to a published API justified by evidence that cannot see its
 * own consumers. Declaring it instead makes the loss loud regardless of
 * whether a consumer exists — which is the property the type-check gate was
 * wrongly credited with, now held by `verifyLocalPatches` and by the round-trip
 * assertion in `scripts/__tests__/shadcn-local-patches.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why the payload is inline here, unlike every family above
 *
 * The families above deliberately keep their payload out of `src/ui/**` and
 * anchor a one-line reference to `src/lib/`. That is not available here and not
 * being skipped: the payload IS the primitive's own prop surface — an optional
 * member on `SheetContentProps`, its destructuring, and the conditional it
 * guards. There is no implementation to host elsewhere. What the rule is really
 * protecting against — a large inlined body that upstream churn will shred — is
 * absent: three anchors, each one line, all of them structural lines of
 * `SheetContent` rather than incidental formatting.
 *
 * All three `find` strings were written from the vendored registry bytes in
 * `scripts/__tests__/fixtures/shadcn-registry/sheet.registry.txt`, not from the
 * shipped file (objectui#4976 is what happens otherwise), and the round-trip
 * assertion holds them to it.

 * A caller that formats its other dates with a tag of its own names it through
