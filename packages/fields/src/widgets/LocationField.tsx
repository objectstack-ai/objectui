 *    `!isNaN(Infinity)` is `true`, so the format gate alone let it through;
 *    `z.number()` rejects it. Same defect class, same fix, no extra branch.
 *
 * ⚠️ Deliberately NOT wired into {@link isLocationValue}, which is the READ
 * guard. A record that already holds an out-of-range pair keeps RENDERING here,
 * so the person who can correct it can still see it — blanking it would hide

 * Truncation is not confined to obvious junk, either — the same reading turns
 * `"0x10"` into `0` (objectui#6272's `|| 0`, arriving through a different

 * ⛔ Nor is this degree/hemisphere PARSING. `12°N` stays refused, deliberately
 * — the maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29 adopts the refusal and declines the
 * notation, because the paste route is unmeasured; it is its own feature card
 * if real demand arrives.

 * it carries no residue and this gate has nothing to say about it; it is

 * ⭐ ARITY — the one question the other two arms did not have to answer.
 * `verb` was English GRAMMAR (`is not a number` / `are not numbers`), and a
 * pack whose plural rules differ cannot inflect around an English verb form
 * handed to it through a hole. So the verb is not a hole: it lives inside two
 * SIBLING KEYS picked here, at the call site.
 *
 * ⛔ Deliberately NOT i18next's `_one`/`_other` suffixes. This repo's own
 * plural convention is a `X` / `XOne` pair branched at the call site —
 * `lookup.recordCount`/`recordCountOne` in this very defaults map
 * (`RecordPickerDialog`), `list.recordCount`/`recordCountOne`,
 * `detail.reactionCount`/`reactionCountOne` — because zh/ja/ko have no separate
 * singular form and would legitimately omit a `_one` half, which
 * `all-locales-key-parity` reads as a missing key (objectstack#5430). The
 * suffix form also needs a base key to cover the categories no pack enumerates
 * (`ru` few/many, `ar` two/zero — objectui#3863); the sibling pair needs none.
 *
 * The arity here is exactly binary and always will be: `residue` is
 * `COORDINATE_LABELS` filtered, and a draft that is not two comma-separated
 * parts never reaches this arm. So `ar` can use its DUAL in the two-half value,
 * which is precisely what an English `verb` hole made impossible.
 *
 * `named`'s two components are split the same way rather than pre-joined:
 * `' and '` was an English conjunction and `latitude`/`longitude` are
 * translatable nouns (every pack already spells them inside its own
 * `refusedFormat`). The nouns are keyed ONCE each and interpolated into both
 * values, so no locale has to keep two spellings of the same word in step. The

 *    coordinate in exactly one place and the box and its refusal cannot name it
 *    differently. No new key: every pack already carries both nouns.
 *  - The ORDER and the SEPARATOR are this widget's INPUT GRAMMAR, not
 *    punctuation. {@link parseDraft} splits on an ASCII `,` and reads the first
 *    part as the latitude — the order of `COORDINATE_LABELS`, which this reads.
 *    So both are written here, and ⛔ deliberately NOT handed to a pack through
 *    a joiner key (the `validation.formInvalidJoiner` shape) or through a pair

 *    re-punctuate the pair with its own script's comma — U+FF0C in zh, U+3001
 *    in ja, U+060C in ar — and `parseDraft` refuses every one of those as not a
 *    pair, so the hint would teach a format this box will not read.
 *
 * That is how objectui#8148 settled the comma-decimal concern for the example
 * digits: the widget fills them in ASCII, so no pack spells a digit and the
 * collision cannot occur rather than being avoided by good behaviour. Here no
 * pack spells the separator. It is also the separator each pack's own
 * `fields.location.refusedFormat` example is written with; both facts are
