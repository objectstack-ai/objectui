/**
 * THE IMPORT BOUNDARY CONVEYS THE PROTOCOL'S OWN GUIDANCE (objectui#9034).
 *
 * `../zod/imported-defaults.ts` promises "the same keys, the same checks, the
 * same descriptions and the same accept set". The description half was the one
 * that was NOT true: across `@objectstack/spec` 17.4.0, every described
 * `ZodDefault` node reachable from the published surface came back with no
 * description at all, and every described CONTAINER node lost theirs as well.
 * Zero survived either way.
 *
 * ⚠️ The two integers this paragraph used to quote for those populations —
 * "2024 of the 2024" and "1364" — are DELETED rather than corrected
 * (objectui#9103). They were not values: they were LOWER BOUNDS, produced by a
 * pairing that stopped dead at every `.optional().default()` node, and a
 * hand-copied integer cannot say how much it failed to look at. The live
 * figures are printed by the census below, derived at run time from the spec
 * version actually installed:
 *
 *     pnpm --filter @object-ui/types exec vitest run \
 *       src/__tests__/imported-defaults-describe-9034.test.ts
 *
 * ⛔ Nothing in this file ASSERTS an integer copied out of that print. Every
 * assertion is a floor, a total-equals-kept identity, or an emptiness, so an
 * upstream spec release moves the populations without looking like a
 * regression here.
 *
 * ## Why it was two losses with one cause, and why the cause is not obvious
 *
 * A zod 4 description is NOT `def` state. `.describe(d)` stores `{description: d}`
 * in `z.globalRegistry` — a WeakMap keyed by the NODE — and the `description`
 * getter reads back through `_zod.parent`, a link only zod's own `clone()`
 * sets. So:
 *
 *  - `.removeDefault()` returns the INNER node, which never carried the outer
 *    node's registry entry. The protocol spells its guidance
 *    `.default(v).describe(d)`, so `d` sat on the node that was discarded.
 *  - `cloneWithDef` builds `new Ctor({...def})`. It copies `def` faithfully —
 *    `def.checks` above all, which is what it exists for — and copies the
 *    description NOT AT ALL, because the description was never in `def`.
 *
 * The module's `lazy` arm already named description loss as the defect it
 * guards against, and named `cloneWithDef` as the guard. That sentence was half
 * wrong: the clone rule saves `def.checks`, and did not save the description.
 *
 * ## What this file pins
 *
 *  1. **The zod facts the fix rests on.** If a later zod propagates the
 *     description through `.removeDefault()`, or puts it back in `def`, the
 *     carry becomes redundant — that must be RED here, not discovered by
 *     someone re-deriving it years later.
 *  2. **The population, re-derived.** Not the number quoted above: the walk
 *     that produced it, run again, over the subpath list read out of the spec's
 *     own `exports` map so a new subpath cannot slip past unmeasured.
 *  3. **⭐ The identity property, which this fix must not buy its way past.**
 *     A subtree with no `ZodDefault` in it still comes back REFERENCE-EQUAL. A
 *     carry implemented by rebuilding nodes that did not need rebuilding would
 *     pass every value assertion in this file and break the one property batch
 *     #90's reversibility argument rests on.
 *  4. **⛔ The spec's graph is not mutated.** The carry runs 267 times on a
 *     branch whose replacement node IS one of the spec's own objects. A carry
 *     that wrote metadata in place instead of cloning would strip-and-relabel
 *     `@objectstack/spec` for every other consumer in the workspace, and every
 *     other assertion here would still be green.
 *
 *  5. **⭐ The instrument, before anything it measures (objectui#9103).** The
 *     census pairs the spec's graph against its stripped twin node by node,
 *     and a pairing that goes wrong does not raise: it walks off the graph,
 *     stops, and reports a SMALLER population with nothing lost — "0 lost"
 *     true by construction because it never looked. So the pairing is
 *     self-tested first on a hand-built corpus whose answer is counted off the
 *     source, and the superseded rule is kept and run as the control that
 *     fires on the real surface.
 *
 * Every count below carries a control that FIRES. A differential whose two
 * sides are the same object, or a census that matched nothing, is green for
 * reasons that have nothing to do with objectui#9034.
