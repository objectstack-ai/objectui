/**
 * objectui#6711 — `ObjectGrid`'s relational copy set must NOT carry
 * `reference_to_field`.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why this is a pin and not a behaviour test
 *
 * The retired key had ZERO readers anywhere in the repo, so removing it changes
 * no rendering at all: every other test in this package stays green whether or
 * not the removal is correct. A green suite therefore proves nothing here. What
 * CAN be asserted is the thing that was actually measured — the key is no
 * longer WRITTEN onto the `fieldMeta` a cell renderer receives — so this file
 * asserts that absence directly, at all three of `generateColumns`'s
 * column-building call sites, and goes red the moment the key is re-added to
 * `RELATIONAL_META_KEYS`.
 *
 * ## The control against vacuity lives in the same assertions
 *
 * Each case also asserts that the SURVIVING keys do arrive on the same
 * meta. An absence assertion on its own passes for the wrong reason as soon as
 * the fixture stops reaching the copy path at all (a renamed helper, a column
 * path that no longer resolves this renderer, a def the grid never reads); the
 * presence half is what makes each `not.toHaveProperty` a measurement rather
 * than a tautology.
 *
 * The probe replaces the registered `lookup` cell renderer, which is exactly
 * how the real `LookupCellRenderer` receives this bag — `getCellRenderer` checks
 * the registry first — so what it captures is the `field` prop the shipped
 * renderer would have been handed.
