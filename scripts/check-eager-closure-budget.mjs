/**
 * The console performance budget, weighed over the EAGER CLOSURE.
 *
 * ## What this replaces
 *
 * `.github/workflows/performance-budget.yml` is named "Bundle Analysis" and its
 * step is "Check console performance budget", but until objectui#5324 it gzipped
 * exactly one file:
 *
 *     ENTRY_FILE=$(find "$DIST_DIR" -name 'index-*.js' ... | head -1)
 *     GZIP_BYTES=$(gzip -c "$ENTRY_FILE" | wc -c)
 *
 * The entry chunk is not what a page load costs. It statically imports a closure
 * of other chunks, and the browser fetches and parses all of them before the app
 * renders. Measured on `77f846a8b`:
 *
 *   | index-*.js alone (what the budget weighed) |    25,910 bytes gzipped |
 *   | the eager closure — 58 of 507 chunks       | 3,881,609 bytes gzipped |
 *
 * So the gate passed on 0.67% of the payload it claimed to govern. That is not
 * theoretical: objectui#5266 put 89 KiB gzipped on every console page load, it
 * landed in `vendor-objectstack-*.js`, and this gate could not see it.
 * `advancedChunks` deliberately routes vendor and workspace code into named
 * chunks, so MOST regressions land outside `index-*.js`.
 *
 * That table is the MOTIVATING measurement and stays pinned to `77f846a8b`; it
 * is not the current reading. {@link BASELINE} carries today's, and the ceiling
 * section below does the arithmetic against it.
 *
 * ⛔ That rule is general, and since objectui#7528 it is a gate rather than an
 * intention: a chunk count written in this file's prose — or in
 * `scripts/__tests__/check-eager-closure-budget.test.ts`'s — stays pinned to the
 * commit it was measured on, as the table above is, or it is not written at all.
 * An UNANCHORED count is a standing claim about the LIVE closure, and the live
 * closure's count moves on most builds. Three sentences here made exactly that
 * claim ("one number over N chunks"), and by the time objectui#7528 read them
 * back the prose, {@link BASELINE}'s frozen `chunks` and the gate's own output
 * were three DIFFERENT numbers — with nothing red anywhere across that spread,
 * because nothing fails on a stale number in a comment. Refreshing the literal
 * would only restart that clock; naming the population has no clock to restart.
 * Two durable readings, neither of them a copy:
 *
 *   * HOW MANY — `pnpm check:eager-closure` prints it, in the gate's own verdict
 *     line: "Console eager closure is N KB gzipped across E of T chunks
 *     (budget: ... KB, headroom: ... KB)".
 *   * WHICH — `apps/console/dist/eager-closure.json`, written by
 *     `emitEagerClosureReport` in `apps/console/vite.config.ts` on every build.
 *
 * {@link BASELINE} is not an exception to it. That constant NAMES the commit it
 * was measured on, which is the anchored form the rule asks for: a frozen
 * measurement that says which build it came from cannot go stale, it can only
 * become old, and re-baselining is what that has instead of a rewrite.
 *
 * ## Where the number comes from
 *
 * `apps/console/vite.config.ts` (`emitEagerClosureReport`) writes
 * `apps/console/dist/eager-closure.json` from rolldown's own `chunk.imports` —
 * a BFS from the entry chunks over STATIC imports only, gzipping the bytes that
 * were actually written to disk. This file only applies a ceiling to it. The
 * split keeps graph knowledge where the graph is and policy where it can be unit
 * tested (`scripts/__tests__/check-eager-closure-budget.test.ts`), and it keeps a
 * size regression from failing every Vercel preview and local build — which is
 * how a budget gets switched off rather than fixed.
 *
 * ## The ceiling, and why it is this number
 *
 * `MAX_EAGER_CLOSURE_GZIP_BYTES` is today's measurement plus headroom of half
 * {@link REGRESSION_THIS_GATE_MUST_CATCH_BYTES}. Two constraints pin it from
 * both sides, and since objectui#5924 BOTH are checked against the report this
 * gate just read, not against a literal frozen next to them:
 *
 *   - It must PASS on today's `main`. A gate that lands red is a gate someone
 *     disables, and this one replaced a gate nobody could fail. ⛔ No figure is
 *     restated here: this bullet carried one and it went a whole re-baseline
 *     stale (objectui#7518). The headroom the CONSTANTS carry is stated once,
 *     on {@link MAX_EAGER_CLOSURE_GZIP_BYTES}; what the LIVE closure has left
 *     is what `pnpm check:eager-closure` prints, and it is the smaller of the
 *     two once the payload has drifted up from the baseline.
 *   - The headroom must stay SMALLER than the regression the gate exists to
 *     catch. objectui#5266 was 89 KiB = 91,136 bytes, and this ceiling is built
 *     to carry half of that, so it would have failed on that change. Widening
 *     the headroom past ~89 KiB would leave the gate green through a repeat of
 *     its own motivating incident.
 *
 * Half the regression size, rather than the ~2% this line used to carry, is a
 * deliberate choice that only became necessary once the second constraint
 * started being enforced live (next section). Headroom H buys H bytes of growth
 * before the gate reds for being over budget, and costs REGRESSION - H bytes of
 * SHRINK before it reds for going blind. H = REGRESSION / 2 is the only value
 * equidistant from the two, and it is the value that maximises the smaller of
 * the two distances: ~45 KB of room in each direction rather than 66 KB one way
 * and 25 KB the other.
 *
 * ## Why the headroom is checked LIVE (objectui#5924)
 *
 * The second constraint above used to be asserted only in the unit test, as
 *
 *     MAX_EAGER_CLOSURE_GZIP_BYTES - BASELINE.gzipBytes < REGRESSION_...
 *
 * Both operands are frozen literals from this module, so that assertion was
 * true regardless of what the console actually weighed, and it stayed true
 * while the closure got ~706 KB SMALLER than the pinned baseline. The invariant
 * was STATED about the live bundle and CHECKED about two constants; it would
 * have stayed green if the closure halved again.
 *
 * What that cost, demonstrated rather than inferred (objectui#5924): with the
 * ceiling at 4,086,000 over a live 3.3 MB payload, an eager
 * `@objectstack/spec/cloud` namespace import into `apps/console/src/main.tsx`
 * added 158,006 gzipped bytes to the closure — 1.7x the incident this gate was
 * built to catch — and the aggregate half printed a green tick with "headroom:
 * 613.4 KB" underneath it.
 *
 * {@link evaluateHeadroomSensitivity} now derives that headroom from the report,
 * for the aggregate ceiling AND for every per-chunk ceiling — four ceilings as
 * of objectui#5490 — and calls a ceiling that sits more than one regression
 * above its own measurement an ERROR (exit 2). That verdict is about the GAUGE,
 * not the bundle, which is why it is an error and not a size failure: a green
 * tick that cannot distinguish "no regression" from "the motivating incident,
 * twice over" carries no information. It is the same shape as a budget keyed on
 * a chunk that is not there, and the same rule applies — measuring nothing must
 * be LOUDER than measuring something over the line, never quieter.
 *
 * The consequence is deliberate: drift in the SHRINKING direction is no longer
 * free. A PR that takes more than ~45 KB out of the closure now has to re-pin
 * the ceiling it just made decorative, in the same commit, instead of leaving a
 * decision that silently comes due and is never taken. The constant-vs-constant
 * assertions stay in the unit test as a secondary guard: they still catch an
 * edit that raises a ceiling past the regression size without any build.
 *
 * ## Why this number has moved (objectui#5328 up, objectui#5924 down)
 *
 * It was 3,960,000 over a 3,881,609 baseline measured on `77f846a8b`. Pinning
 * `@objectstack/spec` and its three siblings to 17.1.0 put the closure 41,689
 * bytes over that ceiling: the release is ~930 KB larger uncompressed, and
 * essentially all of it lands in `vendor-objectstack-*.js`. That is REAL added
 * payload, not a measurement artefact, and it is larger than the #5266
 * regression this gate was sized to catch — the gate did its job.
 *
 * The re-baseline was therefore escalated rather than taken by the seat doing
 * the bump, because #5468 had ruled days earlier that the aggregate ceiling
 * "stays as shipped" and that gate-strength policy is the maintainer's. The
 * maintainer ruled option A on #5531: raise it, permanently, together with the
 * headroom assertion that guards it. Both constants move in ONE commit — raising
 * the ceiling alone leaves headroom at ~200 KB and fails the test below, which
 * is the guard working, not an obstacle to route around.
 *
 * objectui#5924 then lowered it to 3,345,000 over 3,299,898 bytes measured on
 * `48e53814e`: 706,013 bytes BELOW the `4c1623c0c` baseline the previous ceiling
 * was derived from. Nothing was cleaved to earn that — the closure shrank on its
 * own while the ceiling stayed put, which is exactly the drift that opened the
 * blind band above. Lowering a ceiling TOWARD reality is a tightening, not a
 * weakening: no build that passed before the change and measures under 3,345,000
 * fails after it, and the gate's sensitivity is once again larger than the
 * headroom it guards. This was taken as a card's stated decision (objectui#5924,
 * triage disposition 3) rather than silently, which is what the "Raising it"
 * note below asks of a re-baseline in either direction.
 *
 * objectui#6683 lowered it again, to 3,300,000 over 3,254,004 — and this one was
 * EARNED rather than drifted into. `@object-ui/app-shell` now publishes a
 * precise `sideEffects` array (guarded by
 * `scripts/check-side-effects-array.mjs`), which made 56,668 gzipped bytes of
 * the barrel's closure shakeable. That is LARGER than the 45,102 bytes of
 * headroom the 3,345,000 ceiling carried, so the ceiling had to move with it or
 * the aggregate gauge would sit at 1.00x its own sensitivity — the blind band
 * reopening the same day it was measured shut. The two numbers move in ONE
 * commit for the reason the paragraph above gives.
 *
 * objectui#6776 lowered it a third time, to 3,268,000 over 3,222,314, and this
 * one was earned the same way. `views/metadata-admin/index.ts` stopped being a
 * registering module — its five load-time registrations moved to a leaf the
 * PACKAGE ENTRY bare-imports — so the `sideEffects` array stopped naming it, the
 * package barrel's 25 runtime re-exports were re-pointed at leaf modules, and
 * the whole `metadata-admin` chunk (172,945 gzipped bytes, 144 modules) left the
 * eager closure: 3,254,230 -> 3,222,314, −31,916 bytes, measured on two full
 * console builds. The maintainer ruling of 2026-08-30 made the re-baseline part
 * of the change rather than a follow-up, in its own words:
 *
 *     ⛔ ceiling 处置写死(不作实施者临场判断):-31KB 把余量推到 ~0.89x 门禁
 *     89KB 回归阈值(近盲),同批重设 `MAX_EAGER_CLOSURE_GZIP_BYTES`;抬 ceiling
 *     是有申报程序的 ratchet,裁决原话引入 PR 正文。
 *
 * Measured, the drift was 0.85x rather than 0.89x — the gate printed
 * `headroom 75.9 KB = 0.85x the 89.0 KB regression` on the post-change build
 * before this constant moved. Either way it is the blind band reopening, and the
 * direction of this edit is DOWN: no build that passed before it and measures
 * under 3,268,000 fails after it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Read the direction correctly: the closure did NOT fall by the 242.6 KB the
 * objectui#6683 card projected. That figure was measured for
 * `"sideEffects": false`, which is closed by measurement because it also DROPS
 * three live SDUI widget registrations. The precise array keeps them, and
 * keeping them keeps their import closure eager; 56,668 bytes is what the
 * correct declaration actually buys. The gap is not a defect in the array — it
 * is the price of the correctness the ruling required, and the difference is
 * recorded here rather than smoothed over.
 *
 * ⛔ The floor is unchanged and applies to a LOWERING too: never put a ceiling
 * below a measured figure to express an aspiration. That is not a tighter
 * ratchet, it is a gate that lands red on `main`, which is how a budget gets
 * switched off rather than met.
 *
 * What did NOT move: {@link REGRESSION_THIS_GATE_MUST_CATCH_BYTES}. That is the
 * gate's sensitivity, the ruling did not touch it, and re-baselining must never
 * become an excuse to widen it — a ceiling that rises while the sensitivity
 * relaxes is a gate quietly retiring itself.
 *
 * This is a truthful CURRENT-STATE ceiling, not a target. 3.07 MB gzipped
 * before first render is a bad payload, and the honest long-term line is far
 * below it — but lowering the line to a TARGET is a separate decision with its
 * own work behind it (objectui#5324 names the candidates), and re-baselining
 * onto a fresh measurement is not that. Nothing here should be read as a
 * finding that 3.12 MB is acceptable.
 *
 * The two figures in that paragraph are one constant each, rendered in MiB, and
 * not a contradiction: 3.07 MB is {@link BASELINE}'s measured payload and
 * 3.12 MB is {@link MAX_EAGER_CLOSURE_GZIP_BYTES}, the ceiling standing over it.
 * Saying which is which is the whole of this note — a paragraph that names two
 * sizes without naming their subjects reads as one number that changed its mind
 * (objectui#7528).
 *
 * ## Per-chunk ceilings (objectui#5490)
 *
 * One total over the whole eager closure cannot say WHERE the payload moved, and
 * inside its headroom one chunk can grow by the whole allowance while the others
 * shrink.
 * {@link PER_CHUNK_GZIP_CEILINGS} adds a line per big chunk on top of the
 * aggregate — same truthful-current-state discipline, same checked constraints,
 * keyed on the chunk names the REPORT carries so a renamed or vanished chunk
 * fails loudly instead of passing by weighing nothing. See that constant's
 * comment for the reasoning and for how to move one.
 *
 * ## Is the ceiling still the one in force? (objectui#6245)
 *
 * The three halves above all read this file's constants and take them as given.
 * None of them can ask whether the constants THEMSELVES are current, and on a
 * `pull_request` run that question has a wrong answer that is invisible from
 * inside the checkout: `Bundle Analysis` is a required context, GitHub does not
 * re-run a PR's checks when the base branch moves, so a green verdict can be
 * computed against ceilings `main` has since replaced — and the merge is gated
 * on it. Measured, not inferred: run 32804357171 started 6m50s AFTER
 * `0409b766d` lowered the aggregate ceiling to 3,345,000 and published
 * `BUDGET_CLOSURE_BUDGET_KB: 3990.2` — the retired 4,086,000 — as a success.
 *
 * {@link evaluateCeilingFreshness} is the fourth half and closes that window
 * inside the tool: it compares {@link VERDICT_CEILING_CONSTANTS} across three
 * readings of this file — this checkout, the base commit the checkout was made
 * from, and the base branch tip — and calls a ceiling the base branch moved out
 * from under this run an ERROR (exit 2). Three readings rather than two because
 * a re-baseline PR differs from the base branch deliberately and must still
 * land; see that function for the rule and for the residual window it cannot
 * close.
 *
 * ## Raising it
 *
 * Re-baselining is legitimate — it is how a ratchet advances — but it is a
 * DECISION, so make it visible: update the constant, update the measured figure
 * in this comment, and say in the PR what the added bytes buy. Silently bumping
 * the number to make CI green reproduces the gate this file replaced.

/**
 * Ceiling for the console eager closure, in gzipped bytes. See the header for
 * how this number was chosen; measured 3,551,191 on `34a1578ef`.
 *
 * Re-baselined DOWNWARD three times, each time toward a measurement the payload
 * had already fallen to:
 *
 *   - objectui#5924, from 4,086,000 (derived from the 4,005,911 reading on
 *     `4c1623c0c`) to 3,345,000 over 3,299,898 on `48e53814e`.
 *   - objectui#6683, to 3,300,000 over 3,254,004. `@object-ui/app-shell` now
 *     declares a precise `sideEffects` ARRAY, which took 56,668 gzipped bytes
 *     out of the closure — more than the 45,102 of headroom the previous
 *     ceiling had, so leaving it in place would have parked the aggregate gauge
 *     at 1.00x its own sensitivity and, on the next byte of shrink, tripped the
 *     exit-2 verdict about the gauge. Lowering it in the SAME change is the
 *     tightening the maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29 asked for.
 *   - objectui#6776, to 3,268,000 over 3,222,314. The metadata-admin engine's
 *     five load-time registrations moved out of the page barrel, so the barrel
 *     stopped being named by the `sideEffects` array and the 172,945-byte
 *     `metadata-admin` chunk left the eager closure (−31,916 bytes). The
 *     3,300,000 ceiling was measured carrying 75.9 KB of headroom afterwards —
 *     0.85x the regression this gate must catch, the blind band reopening — and
 *     the 2026-08-30 ruling made moving it part of the same change.
 *
 * Headroom above {@link BASELINE} is 45,809 bytes — 0.50x
 * {@link REGRESSION_THIS_GATE_MUST_CATCH_BYTES}. ⚠️ That is arithmetic on two
 * constants in this file, so it stays true while they do — it is NOT what the
 * closure has left today, which is smaller by every byte the payload has
 * drifted up since the baseline below was taken. `pnpm check:eager-closure`
 * prints the figure in force, and that is the one governing your build.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ RAISED ONCE, ON EXPLICIT MAINTAINER AUTHORISATION (objectui#7122)
 *
 * Raising this ceiling is a gate weakening and sits on the manual floor, so it
 * is a human's act, not an agent's. The authorisation, verbatim:
 *
 *     维护者 sam@objectstack.ai 于本轮明确授权：「抬上限，把 7685 弄绿」
 *
 * recorded on objectui#7122 as decision batch 1 item 1 = "B + A" (a one-time,
 * cause-recorded adjustment of exactly the measured delta, with the upstream
 * card filed alongside).
 *
 * ⛔ WHAT THE BYTES BUY, stated plainly because this is NOT routine growth and
 * must not read as one. The residue is `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0's own
 * browser-dist growth: +292.2 KB gzip on the spec package alone, whose measured
 * mechanism is that 17.3.0 LENGTHENED the Zod `.describe()` doc strings that
 * ship in the browser build ("Output schema" became "Output schema (JSON
 * Schema)", and so on across the schema surface). It is authoring documentation
 * prose, shipped to every page load.
 *
 * ⛔ It is NOT duplication — that was a separate, larger problem and it is
 * already fixed. Resolving the spec alone to 17.3.0 shipped TWO copies of it
 * (four sibling packages pin it exactly), which this branch collapsed by moving
 * the family together in the lockfile: −671 KB, and the probe for markers
 * unique to 17.2.0 fell from 92.3% to 1.0% of 104, with the single survivor
 * accounted for. No chunk entered or left the closure; the eager chunk count is
 * unchanged.
 *
 * ⇒ ⭐ THE HONEST LONG-TERM FIX IS UPSTREAM, and this ceiling is the marker for
 * it, not the answer to it: a `describe()`-stripped browser build returns
 * ~292 KB to EVERY consumer of the spec, not just this console. Filed as
 * objectstack#16063. RESTORE CONDITION: when that lands, re-measure and bring
 * this ceiling and {@link BASELINE} back down together. ⛔ No other exemption
 * was added, no import was made lazy, and no other ceiling was moved — the
 * three per-chunk lines that still pass were left exactly as they are.

 * carries (objectui#5490, the ruled follow-up of objectui#5468: option A now,
 * option C next, option B — a comparison against `main` — rejected).
 *
 * ## Why the aggregate ceiling is not enough
 *
 * The aggregate is one number over every chunk in the closure. Inside its
 * headroom, a single chunk can grow by the whole allowance while every other
 * chunk shrinks by the
 * same amount, and the gate reports a green tick either way. That is not a
 * hypothetical shape: objectui#5266 put 89 KiB on every page load and ALL of it
 * landed in `vendor-objectstack`, the chunk that is 29% of the closure today.
 * The aggregate says whether the payload grew; these say WHERE.
 *
 * ## Why the keys are names from the report and not names written here
 *
 * The names are decided by `advancedChunks.groups` in
 * `apps/console/vite.config.ts`, emitted by rolldown, and published in
 * `files[].name`. This file looks them up; it does not re-derive them by
 * stripping `-<hash>.js` off a file name, and it does not carry a list of
 * chunks it EXPECTS to exist independent of the measurement.
 *
 * The distinction is the whole design, because the failure mode is silent. A
 * budget keyed on a chunk name that no longer exists is VACUOUSLY GREEN: it
 * passes because there is nothing to weigh. So a budgeted name that is absent
 * from the report is an ERROR here (exit 2, "the gauge cannot be trusted"),
 * never a skip — the same asymmetry {@link validateReport} exists for. If a
 * group is renamed or removed in `vite.config.ts`, this gate stops the build
 * and says so, and the mapping is re-pinned deliberately.
 *
 * ## Why `framework` moved (objectui#6759)
 *
 * From 502,000 over a 492,399 reading on `2c8474c04` to 512,000 over 502,405
 * on `a64e96ca8`. What the added bytes buy is user-facing diagnostic text, in
 * ten locales, for two ordinary author mistakes that used to be unreported:
 *
 *   - a malformed or absent gantt date crashed the render outright
 *     (`RangeError: Invalid time value`), and
 *   - an inverted author-pinned range drew a bar at `width: -4.3%` under a
 *     header row with zero cells, and said nothing at all.
 *
 * A hard crash and a confidently-wrong render, both reachable from a typo in
 * authored metadata, replaced by a refusal that names the offending value.
 *
 * The CODE that fix added buys none of this chunk, which is why there was
 * nothing to trim instead: `plugin-timeline` is lazy and is not in the eager
 * closure at all, so the guard, the value speller and both refusal branches
 * cost this budget zero. Every byte of the growth is `packages/i18n` locale
 * data, which lands here. Measured on the built chunk by deleting the twenty
 * strings and re-gzipping: the ten locales' message text is 1,999 of the
 * ~2,283 bytes the chunk grew by, and PER MESSAGE it costs 1,000 bytes
 * against the 1,002 that objectui#6655's single refusal — the neighbour whose
 * shape this one copied — already costs in the same chunk. The only lever
 * left was to say less, in ten languages, about what the author got wrong.
 *
 * ⚠️ Most of the headroom this consumed was not spent by that card. The
 * previous ceiling carried 9,601 bytes and `main` had already drifted to
 * 488.4 KB of the 490.2 KB it allowed — 1.8 KB left, 0.02x the regression
 * this gate must catch — before objectui#6759 added a byte (`b98352a15`,
 * this PR's base, the gate's own printed line). Re-pinning the baseline onto
 * a fresh measurement is what puts the gauge back in range. The drift itself,
 * and that nobody could say which side moved it, is objectui#6631; this card
 * does not close it and deliberately leaves the other two entries alone.
 *
 * ## Why `framework` moved again — objectui#7173, +4,671 bytes
 *
 * `AiPendingActionsInbox` (the AI HITL approval inbox) was the fifth untranslated
 * copy of the relative-time helper in this repo AND had no translation wiring at
 * all, so it was swept whole: every string it shows now resolves from the locale
 * packs. Thirty-eight new keys, translated in all ten languages — an `aiApprovals`
 * namespace in `packages/i18n`. That is what the bytes buy: the AI approvals inbox
 * reads in the session's language instead of English, headings, tabs, status
 * badges, empty state, drawer labels, reject dialog and all.
 *
 * The COMPONENT costs this budget nothing: `plugin-chatbot` is lazy and is not in
 * the eager closure. Every byte is `packages/i18n` locale data, which lands in
 * this chunk — the same mechanism as objectui#6759's twenty strings above.
 *
 * ATTRIBUTED, not assumed. Three console builds, the two extremes byte-identical
 * in the two chunks that did not move:

 *   | build                                              | `framework` gzip |
 *   | merge parent `c93b4d5f3`                           |          510,192 |
 *   | this branch with the ten `aiApprovals` blocks cut  |          510,192 |
 *   | this branch                                        |          514,863 |
 *
 * The ablated build reproduces the merge parent's figure exactly, so the whole
 * 4,671-byte delta is the pack blocks and nothing else — not the new
 * `useAiApprovalsTranslation.ts` module, not the converted component.
 * `vendor-objectstack` is 947,931 on both; `ui-components` moves one byte.
 *
 * Most of the overage was drift, again: the merge parent already stood at 510,192
 * of the 512,000 the previous ceiling allowed — 1,808 bytes left, 0.02x the
 * regression this gate must catch — so a 4.6 KB addition put it 2,863 bytes over.
 * The new pair re-pins the gauge onto a fresh measurement and KEEPS the line's own
 * headroom convention rather than widening it: 9,137 bytes (0.10x), against the
 * 9,595 (0.11x) the retired pair carried. objectui#6631 still owns the drift.
 *
 * ## Why `framework` moved DOWN, and where its bytes went — objectui#7399
 *
 * From 524,000 over 514,863 to 71,000 over 61,465, and a fourth line appears:
 * `i18n-locales`, 455,000 over 446,076. Neither number is a payload change. The
 * console downloads the same eager closure before and after; it is written to
 * two more files.
 *
 * What this ceiling was actually weighing, measured on `e307c9896` from the
 * emitted chunk's own module list — the `framework` chunk held 166 modules and
 * only 145 of them came from `core|react|types`, its own test:
 *
 *   | packages/i18n             |  16 mod | 78.7% of the chunk's bytes |
 *   | packages/core             |  67 mod |  9.6% |
 *   | packages/react            |  63 mod |  4.7% |
 *   | packages/data-objectstack |   5 mod |  4.6% |
 *   | packages/types            |  15 mod |  2.3% |
 *
 * Five workspace groups in `apps/console/vite.config.ts` sat at `priority: 80`
 * with `framework` written first, and on that tie the subgraph reached through
 * `@object-ui/react` was absorbed by the group listed first — a group whose
 * regex matches NEITHER intruder. So this line was, in operation, a budget on
 * the TEN LOCALE CATALOGUES: 523,959 measured against 524,000, forty-one bytes
 * of headroom for the whole repository, while `data-adapter` — declared since
 * objectui#5490 — emitted no chunk at all.
 *
 * ⛔ The expensive half is not the arithmetic. A gate whose message says "you
 * grew `core|react|types`" when the cause is a translation key teaches a FALSE
 * RULE, and it was followed: two changes were publicly blamed for bytes they do
 * not ship (objectui#7399's own retraction). Naming the chunk for what it holds
 * is what makes the constraint legible where it is authored.
 *
 * Lifting the two swallowed groups one tier above the tie (priority 84) gives
 * each ceiling a subject its name states. Measured across the change:
 *
 *   | chunk           | before  | after   |
 *   | `framework`     | 523,959 |  61,465 |  166 modules -> 140, all core/react/types
 *   | `i18n-locales`  |       — | 446,076 |  22 modules, 100% packages/i18n
 *   | `data-adapter`  |       — |  17,846 |  10 modules, 91.8% data-objectstack
 *   | aggregate       |3,255,233|3,256,012|  +779 B, +0.024%
 *
 * The +779 is the cost of two more chunk boundaries — `import` statements in
 * the chunks that now name two files where they named one — and it is stated
 * here because it is the ONE thing this change spends. ⛔ It is not headroom to
 * borrow against, and {@link MAX_EAGER_CLOSURE_GZIP_BYTES} was deliberately NOT
 * touched: the maintainer ruling of 2026-09-03 authorised a re-attribution and
 * the per-chunk re-baseline it forces, and nothing else. Its own words:
 *
 *     ⛔ The aggregate ceiling is not touched. A′ is a pure re-attribution —
 *     the browser downloads exactly the same bytes.
 *
 * ⚠️ Both new pairs are why the re-baseline is not optional. Left at 524,000
 * over a 61,465 payload, `framework` sits 5.08x above its own measurement and
 * {@link evaluateHeadroomSensitivity} returns exit 2 — the blind-gauge verdict,
 * correctly. The new pairs keep this line's own headroom convention rather than
 * widening it: 9,535 bytes (0.10x) for `framework`, 8,924 (0.10x) for
 * `i18n-locales`, against the 9,137 (0.10x) the retired `framework` pair
 * carried.
 *
 * `data-adapter` gets no ceiling. 17,846 bytes is smaller than a dozen
 * unbudgeted eager chunks, and this constant is a line per BIG chunk, not a
 * line per named group; inventing one for it would be a number with no
 * incident behind it.
 *
 * ⭐ Read the new `i18n-locales` headroom for what it is. 8,924 bytes above the
 * baseline it was measured from is about sixty translation keys at the measured
 * ~147 gzipped bytes a short key costs across ten locales — enough for the five
 * PRs this unparked, and then the AGGREGATE line becomes the binding one. ⛔ Its
 * headroom is not restated here: the figure that was went stale inside a
 * fortnight (objectui#7518), and `pnpm check:eager-closure` prints both lines in
 * force on your own build. That the aggregate is the correct place for the
 * constraint to live is the argument for taking the catalogues out of the eager
 * closure rather than for raising anything.
 *
 * ## Raising one
 *
 * Same discipline as {@link MAX_EAGER_CLOSURE_GZIP_BYTES}, and the same two
 * constraints, both CHECKED in `scripts/__tests__/check-eager-closure-budget.test.ts`:
 * every ceiling passes on the measurement in {@link PER_CHUNK_BASELINE}, and its
 * headroom stays under {@link REGRESSION_THIS_GATE_MUST_CATCH_BYTES} so a repeat
 * of the incident that motivated the gate cannot fit inside it. ⛔ Do not LOWER
 * one below the measured figure to express an aspiration: this is a ratchet, and
 * a ceiling under today's reality is a gate that lands red on `main`, which is
 * how a budget gets switched off rather than met. Shrinking the payload is real
 * work with its own cards (objectui#5324 names the candidates); when it lands,
 * re-measure and lower both numbers together.

/**
 * The measurement {@link PER_CHUNK_GZIP_CEILINGS} was derived from, read out of
 * the report a `vite build` of `apps/console` wrote. Provenance is per KEY, not
 * per file, and saying so is the point — a comment that names one commit for
 * three numbers taken on two is the drift objectui#6631 is open about:
 *
 *   - `vendor-objectstack` — `34a1578ef` (objectui#7122), re-measured when the
 *     `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 family bump moved this chunk and its ceiling
 *     was raised with the aggregate. Same build as {@link BASELINE}, so the
 *     two are directly comparable; it superseded `2c8474c04` (objectui#5490).
 *   - `ui-components` — `2c8474c04` (objectui#5490).
 *   - `framework`, `i18n-locales` — `e307c9896` plus objectui#7399's own
 *     re-attribution diff; see "Why `framework` moved DOWN" above. Both were
 *     read from ONE console build, so they are directly comparable to each
 *     other and to the 523,959 the same tree measured with the groups still
 *     tied. This `framework` reading supersedes objectui#7173's, whose
 *     three-build attribution the paragraph above that one still explains, and
 *     objectui#6759's `a64e96ca8` before it.
 *
 *     ⚠️ Unlike every other entry here, these two are NOT a reading of an
 *     unmodified tree: the chunks they name do not exist without the diff that
 *     recorded them, because that diff is what creates the second one. The
 *     `scripts/vite-*.ts`-versus-`scripts/check-*.mjs` argument {@link BASELINE}
 *     makes about its own commit does NOT cover them — `apps/console/vite.config.ts`
 *     IS a build input, deliberately, and moving it is the change. What keeps
 *     them honest instead is that the gate re-reads them on every CI build of
 *     the branch that carries the diff.
 *
 * Exported so the ceilings are CHECKED against it instead of merely asserted
 * in this comment.
 *
 * ⚠️ These readings are on DIFFERENT commits from {@link BASELINE} above —
 * except `vendor-objectstack`, which as of objectui#7122 shares BASELINE's
 * commit exactly — and WHICH ONE IS LATER flips every time either side is
 * re-baselined, so read the commit names, never a direction asserted here. As
 * of objectui#7122 the AGGREGATE is the later reading: BASELINE's `34a1578ef`
 * is dated 2026-09-06 against `2c8474c04` on 2026-08-25 for `ui-components`
 * here, and `a64e96ca8` was recorded by objectui#6759, which landed
 * 2026-08-29. This paragraph asserted the reverse,
 * in the present tense, from objectui#5490 until objectui#6778 — true when it
 * was written, then left standing while three aggregate re-baselines moved
 * {@link BASELINE} out from under it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Do not expect `git show` to answer for all of these. Squash-merge keeps the
 * landing commit and drops the PR branch, so of the three named above only
 * `2c8474c04` is an ancestor of `main`; `3d257c85a` still resolves as an object
 * but is not on `main` (it landed as `350509b53`), and `a64e96ca8` is not an
 * object in this repository at all. That is why every hash here is cited WITH
 * its issue: the issue outlives the hash.
 *
 * The aggregate ceiling and its baseline were deliberately NOT touched by
 * objectui#5490: objectui#5468 had ruled that the aggregate line "stays as
 * shipped", and moving it — in either direction — is the maintainer's call. That
 * is why the provenance splits in the first place.
 *
 * ⛔ The stale direction is the cheap half. The expensive half is the CONCLUSION
 * this paragraph used to draw from it: that the aggregate ceiling sat far above
 * the payload — 4,086,000 over the 3,298,620 reading, 787,380 bytes of headroom,
 * 8.64x {@link REGRESSION_THIS_GATE_MUST_CATCH_BYTES} — and that these per-chunk
 * ceilings were therefore the only lines holding the three biggest chunks in
 * place. That was accurate for objectui#5490 and is now false: objectui#5924,
 * objectui#6683 and objectui#6776 lowered the aggregate ceiling three times,
 * onto 3,268,000, and it is back in range and doing work.
 *
 * Checked rather than argued, which is the rule everywhere else in this file. A
 * full console build on `e33b44796` and `pnpm check:eager-closure` printed:
 *
 *     ✅ aggregate closure          3149.2 KB measured / 3191.4 KB ceiling (headroom 42.2 KB = 0.47x)
 *     ✅ chunk `vendor-objectstack`  925.7 KB measured /  944.3 KB ceiling (headroom 18.6 KB = 0.21x)
 *     ✅ chunk `framework`           492.9 KB measured /  500.0 KB ceiling (headroom  7.1 KB = 0.08x)
 *     ✅ chunk `ui-components`       386.2 KB measured /  389.6 KB ceiling (headroom  3.4 KB = 0.04x)
 *
 * All four sit inside one regression, which is the whole of what "in range"
 * means here — {@link evaluateHeadroomSensitivity} calls 1.00x an error. So the
 * relationship these ceilings have to the aggregate is no longer "we are the
 * half that still works". It is narrower, and still worth having: WHICH line is
 * tightest moves with every build and is not restated here — the ranking this
 * sentence used to assert had inverted by the time anyone re-read it
 * (objectui#7518) — and whichever it is, these say WHERE, which one total
 * never can.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not size a re-baseline off the figures above. They are ONE dated run,
 * taken before objectui#7399 re-attributed `framework`, so its `framework` row
 * weighs locale catalogues that line no longer holds. They are recorded so this
 * paragraph rests on a measurement instead of an argument; the answer in force
 * is the table the gate prints on YOUR build. That this prose
 * went three re-baselines stale while the numbers beside it could not
 * (objectui#6778) is the reason to distrust the prose first.
 *
 * Keys must match {@link PER_CHUNK_GZIP_CEILINGS} exactly (a test enforces it):
 * a ceiling with no measurement behind it is a number someone guessed, and a
 * measurement with no ceiling weighs nothing.

/**
 * Weigh every ceiling against the payload it governs, and refuse a ceiling that
 * has drifted out of range of the regression it exists to catch (objectui#5924).
 *
 * ## The failure this exists for
 *
 * Both other halves answer "is the bundle under its line?". Neither can answer
 * "is that line still close enough to the bundle to mean anything?", and that
 * question has a silent wrong answer: a ceiling far above the payload passes
 * everything, prints a green tick with a large `headroom:` figure beside it, and
 * reads as a healthy bundle. The header records the measurement — the aggregate
 * ceiling was 8.6x the regression size above the live payload, and a +154 KB
 * eager regression went green through it.
 *
 * The invariant was not missing, it was checked in the wrong place: the unit
 * test compared {@link MAX_EAGER_CLOSURE_GZIP_BYTES} with
 * {@link BASELINE}.gzipBytes, two literals frozen in this module, so it was true
 * no matter what the console weighed. This function computes the same quantity
 * from the report the gate just read, so drift reds the moment it opens instead
 * of the day someone re-measures by hand.
 *
 * ## Why `error` and not `fail`
 *
 * `fail` is a verdict about the BUNDLE — it grew past a line. Nothing has grown
 * here; the ceiling has stopped being a measurement of anything. That is a
 * verdict about the GAUGE, which is what exit 2 means in this file, and it is
 * the same asymmetry {@link evaluatePerChunkBudgets} applies to a budgeted chunk
 * that is absent: a check that passes by measuring nothing must be LOUDER than
 * one that fails by measuring something, never quieter.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not treat a NEGATIVE headroom — a ceiling under the payload — as its
 * business. That is an over-budget bundle, the other two halves own it, and
 * reporting it here as well would turn one regression into an error and teach a
 * reader to distrust the exit code. Over-budget rows are still printed, marked
 * as such, so the table is a complete picture of every ceiling.

/**
 * The FOURTH half: is the ceiling this run weighed against still the ceiling in
 * force on the base branch? (objectui#6245)
 *
 * ## The race
 *
 * `Bundle Analysis` is a required context, and a `pull_request` run checks out
 * the MERGE REF — a merge of the PR head with the base branch as GitHub last
 * computed it. GitHub does not re-run a PR's checks when the base branch moves,
 * so a green verdict can be computed against ceiling constants that `main` has
 * since replaced, and the merge is then gated on a verdict about a ceiling that
 * no longer exists.
 *
 * Observed live rather than reasoned about: run 32804357171 started at
 * 03:13:27Z, six minutes and fifty seconds after `0409b766d` lowered
 * {@link MAX_EAGER_CLOSURE_GZIP_BYTES} from 4,086,000 to 3,345,000 on `main`,
 * and published `BUDGET_CLOSURE_BUDGET_KB: 3990.2` — 4,086,000 bytes, the
 * retired ceiling — with `conclusion: success`. It did not bite: the payload was
 * 3222.6 KB, under both numbers. What bounds how much the NEXT one could hide is
 * the aggregate headroom in force, which `pnpm check:eager-closure` prints and
 * this comment deliberately does not restate: the figure that stood here was two
 * re-baselines out of date (objectui#7518).
 *
 * ## Why THREE readings and not two
 *
 * Comparing this checkout's ceilings against the base branch's is not enough: a
 * re-baseline PR differs from the base branch ON PURPOSE, and failing it would
 * make the one PR that must land unlandable. So the question is not "do they
 * differ" but "did the BASE BRANCH move them out from under this checkout":
 *
 *   - `prBaseSource` — the checker at the base commit this checkout was
 *     computed from. What the base branch said when the merge ref was made.
 *   - `baseSource` — the checker at the base branch tip right now. What the
 *     merge would actually land on.
 *   - `headSource` — the checker in this checkout. What the verdict used.
 *
 * A ceiling is SUPERSEDED when it moved between the first two AND this checkout
 * does not carry the move. A re-baseline PR moves it in `headSource` only, the
 * first two agree, and nothing fires.
 *
 * ## Why `error` (exit 2) and not `fail`
 *
 * `fail` is a verdict about the BUNDLE — it grew past a line. Nothing has grown
 * here and no ceiling has drifted; the measurement above is sound and the
 * ceilings on the base branch are sound. What is wrong is that they were never
 * weighed against each other. That is a verdict about the GAUGE, which is what
 * exit 2 means in this file, and the message says so in as many words — a
 * freshness failure that reads like "the bundle grew" would send its reader
 * hunting a regression that is not there.
 *
 * ## What this closes, and what it does not
 *
 * It closes the window this card recorded: a run that EXECUTES after the
 * constants move, with a checkout that predates it. It cannot close the window
 * where the run finishes BEFORE the constants move and the PR is merged after —
 * no code of ours runs at that moment. That residual is what the `push`-on-main
 * run detects after the fact, and closing it needs "require branches to be up to
 * date before merging", a repository setting and a maintainer-floor decision
 * this file has no business making.
