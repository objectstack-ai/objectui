 *
 * The source is NOT the data-table's `DataTableSchema.rowEditPredicates` /
 * `rowDeletePredicates`: this surface is never handed those keys. `ObjectGrid`
 * resolves the OBJECT's `userActions.edit` / `delete` through
 * `resolveRowCrudAffordances` (`../rowCrudAffordances`), which returns
 * `CrudAffordances['editPredicates']` / `['deletePredicates']` — the spec-owned
 * `RowCrudPredicates` (ADR-0103), parsed in exactly one place
 * (`@object-ui/core`'s `normalizeUserAction`) and re-exported there from
 * `@objectstack/spec/data`. Deriving from the data-table's twins would have
 * bound this file to a schema key it never sees: a NEW wrong coupling in place
 * of the old missing one.
 *
 * The union of the two twins is deliberate, exactly as in PR #4423: every
 * consumer that reads this alias serves BOTH built-ins (`name: 'edit' |
 * 'delete'`), so it may only read keys that BOTH affordance keys declare — if
 * either twin dropped one, the read stops compiling instead of silently reading
 * `undefined`. Today the twins are declared as one named type, so the union
 * collapses onto it; the construction is what states the constraint that
 * outlives that coincidence.
 *
 * Deriving also TIGHTENS what this file accepts, and that is the point rather
 * than a side effect: the hand-written pair typed both keys `unknown`, while
 * the spec types them `Expression | ExpressionInput` — the authored CEL
 * shorthand or its `{ dialect, source }` envelope. `@object-ui/core` retired
 * the same imprecision at its own seam and said so in as many words ("The local
 * `unknown` was imprecision, not a deliberate dialect"); this was the last copy
 * of it.
 *
 * Behavior is unchanged and stays the posture `RowCrudActionOverrideSchema`
 * specifies: `visibleWhen` fails CLOSED (the item is not rendered for this row),
 * `disabledWhen` fails soft (a faulting predicate leaves the item enabled), both
 * evaluated per row on the canonical CEL engine — the same machinery as custom
 * actions' `visible` / `disabled`. The fail direction is where the two families
 * part: a custom action's `disabled` fails CLOSED since objectui#11242, while
 * `disabledWhen` keeps the posture above (PR objectui#4515).
