/**
 * ⭐ THE RETIRED-DIALECT ARM — objectui#7650.
 *
 * The card measured that the object-schema SERVE path never parses, so
 * `FieldSchema` strictness is evidence about the WRITE door only: a document
 * stored before a key was tightened is served back verbatim, forever. Three
 * retirement cards (#7155, #7166, #7435) had already narrowed the consumer
 * reads to the camelCase spelling. This arm supplies the half that makes that
 * narrowing safe — the legacy spelling is canonicalised ONCE, at ingestion.
 *
 * ## What is pinned, and why each half is here
 *
 * The maintainer route ruling (comment 5605081157) chose the DERIVED fold — the
 * spec's own alias probe (lowercase, strip `_` `-` space) matched exactly
 * against `FieldSchema`'s declared key set — over a hand-written table, and
 * required the negative pins by name. The negatives are the load-bearing half:
 * an implementation that folded everything it could not recognise would pass
 * every positive assertion below.
 *
 *   - `id_field` is NOT folded. It has no declared successor (`FieldSchema` has
 *     no `idField`; the spec's only `idField` sits on `InlineGridColumnSchema`),
 *     and the spec's own `FIELD_KEY_GUIDANCE.id_field` row says so: a `why`, no
 *     `to`. The point of the derived rule is that the no-fold falls out of it
 *     for free rather than being written as a special case. The row reaches the
 *     DIAGNOSTIC only — pinned by the describe `the id_field diagnostic carries
 *     the PUBLISHED spec reason (objectui#7650)`.
 *   - `sortible`, a pure TYPO, is NOT folded. The refused alternative was to
 *     call the spec's `lintAuthoredRecordKeys` and fold on its `suggestion`:
 *     that function falls through to a Levenshtein matcher when no `to` row
 *     exists, so it answers "did you mean `sortable`?" for this very input. A
 *     serve path that silently corrects a typo is worse than the defect it fixes.
 *   - `title_format` is NOT folded. It is explicitly out of this card's scope
 *     (it needs an eight-key maintainer ruling), and it too lands there by the
 *     rule rather than by an exclusion.
 *
 * ## ⭐ THE THREE INVERTED PINS — objectui#8938
 *
 * Three assertions in this file used to read `expect(warn).not.toHaveBeenCalled()`,
 * which pinned the ABSENCE of maintainer ruling item 3's diagnostic (objectui#7650,
 * comment 5572018999: a loud diagnostic, not a silent drop, for a spelling the
 * choke point cannot fold). Each is now inverted in place and tightened rather
 * than removed — the negative behaviour each one guards (no fold, no typo
 * correction, no overwrite) is asserted exactly as before, and the refusal is
 * additionally required to be audible. The diagnostic's own surface — its three
 * refusals, its two deliberate silences and its memo — is pinned in the sibling
 * file named by the describe `the ruling’s diagnostic for a spelling the choke
 * point CANNOT fold (objectui#8938)`, together with the width measurement that
 * card asked for.
 *
 * ## The contract-derivation pins
 *
 * `describe('derives the fold from the contract, not from a table')` asserts the
 * rule against `FieldSchema` itself rather than against a copy of its key list:
 * every folded pair must be one the spec REFUSES in the legacy spelling and
 * ACCEPTS in the canonical one, with lit controls in the same read. Without
 * that, this file would be pinning the implementation's opinion of the contract
 * instead of the contract.
