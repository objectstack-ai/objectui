/**
 * objectui#8254 — `ObjectView` honours a SPEC-SHAPED named list view.
 *
 * ## The card, and the ordering it inherits
 *
 * objectui#7928's ruling (decision batch #70, option A) mirrors
 * `ObjectViewSchema.listViews` BY REFERENCE onto the protocol's
 * `ObjectListViewSchema` (`@objectstack/spec/ui`) — the direction already ruled
 * for `navigation` / `searchableFields` / `filterableFields` on objectui#7779.
 * That ruling also fixes the ORDER: ⛔ the mirror is never shipped as a
 * type-only edit, because a declaration that admits a shape the renderer drops
 * is a contract the product does not keep. This file is the renderer half, and
 * it is written so the mirror can land after it without a single new assertion.
 *
 * ## THE FIXTURE IS SPEC-SHAPED BY CONSTRUCTION, NOT BY ASSERTION
 *
 * {@link SPEC_VIEW} is built by running `ObjectListViewSchema.parse(...)`. A
 * fixture that merely LOOKS spec-shaped pins the author's memory of the
 * protocol; one that has been through the protocol's own parser cannot drift
 * from it, and when the protocol moves this file fails at construction time
 * with the parser's own message rather than passing while testing the wrong
 * shape. The schema is `.strict()` upstream, so the parse is also what proves
 * the fixture carries no local-dialect key.
 *
 * ## BOTH LEGS RIDE ONE FIXTURE, SIDE BY SIDE
 *
 * Every case below resolves the spec-shaped view and {@link LOCAL_VIEW} — the
 * equivalent written in the local `NamedListView` dialect — through the SAME
 * route and asserts them against each other in the same `expect`. The card asks
 * that "a spec-shaped named view renders the same columns/filter as the
 * equivalent local one did"; asserting the two against a hard-coded literal in
 * two separate cases would let both drift together and still pass. Equivalence
 * is the claim, so equivalence is what is asserted.
 *
 * ## The gap this pins, measured on the base tree
 *
 * `columns`. The protocol declares it `string[] | ListColumn[]`; the local
 * `NamedListView` declares `string[]`. Two of the three routes out of
 * `ObjectView` end in a NAME slot (`ObjectGridSchema.fields`, and the `fields`
 * of the node `generateViewSchema` emits) whose consumers index records by each
 * entry. Before this change the named-view segment reached both raw, so a
 * spec-shaped `ListColumn[]` arrived as a non-empty field list naming nothing —
 * verbatim the failure `tableColumnFieldNames`' own header describes for
 * `table.columns`, which objectui#5269 already answered at that boundary.
 * `viewColumnFieldNames` answers it at this one.
 *
 * `filter`, `sort`, `label` and `data` needed no renderer change and are pinned
 * anyway, because "already works" is exactly the claim that rots silently.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification — prediction, and where the prediction was WRONG
 *
 * Predicted before the run: the four `columns` cases RED with the two
 * `viewColumnFieldNames(...)` call sites reverted to their raw forwards, every
 * other case GREEN. Measured: THREE red, and the prediction was wrong about
 * which three — recorded here rather than quietly re-fitted, because the miss
 * is the useful part. Two of the four `columns` cases assert a UNION slot
 * (`ObjectGridSchema.columns`, the delegated `list-view` `columns`), which the
 * fix never touched, so they stayed green exactly as they should — they are
 * controls, not fix cases, and the prediction had mis-sorted them. The third
 * red came from the controls block instead: the no-identity case, which rides
 * the fold. ⇒ RED = the two NAME-slot cases plus the no-identity case; GREEN =
 * everything else, the two union-slot cases included. A control that moves with
 * the fix is a control that was carrying the fix; these did not move.
 *
 * The mutation reached the code under test directly — this file imports
 * `../ObjectView` by relative path, so no `dist/` sits between the edit and the
 * run and no rebuild can mask it. Both legs (mutate, restore) proved the edit
 * on disk by occurrence count and by `git hash-object` against the `HEAD` blob;
 * the run log and the two hashes are quoted on the PR.
