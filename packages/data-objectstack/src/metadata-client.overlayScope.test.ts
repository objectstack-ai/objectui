/**
 * `MetadataLayered.overlayScope` ↔ spec vocabulary pin (objectui#4982).
 *
 * The field was declared `string | null` under a doc comment naming the
 * vocabulary as `organization | environment | package`. All three spellings are
 * rejected by the producer's own schema, `package` was never a scope on this
 * field at all, and `string` meant no compiler anywhere in the repo had an
 * opinion — so the wrong comment was the only description of the vocabulary a
 * reader (or an agent) had. It is now derived from
 * `GetMetaItemLayeredResponseSchema`, and this file is what keeps it derived.
 *
 * ## Why the pin is split across two mechanisms
 *
 * There is no runtime witness to compare by reference here, so the strongest
 * form used elsewhere in the repo — `expect(local).toBe(spec)` on a re-exported
 * zod object (`packages/types/src/__tests__/spec-subschema-parity.test.ts`) —
 * has nothing to assert: the binding is a TYPE alias, and the shipped module
 * imports no spec VALUE. Manufacturing one (exporting a copy of the enum's
 * options from this package purely so a test could pin it) would create exactly
 * the fork the derivation guard rejects, so it is deliberately not done.
 *
 * What replaces it, at the same strength:
 *
 *   1. The `satisfies` block below, in BOTH directions. This package's
 *      `tsconfig.json` includes the whole of `src` (tests included), so
 *      `pnpm --filter @object-ui/data-objectstack type-check` compiles this
 *      file — these are enforcement, not decoration (the objectui#3009
 *      distinction).
 *   2. The `@ts-expect-error` line. Reverting the field to `string | null` makes
 *      `'organization'` assignable again, the directive stops suppressing
 *      anything, and `tsc` fails it as TS2578. That is the one line that turns a
 *      revert of this fix red.
 *   3. `LAYER_SCOPE_ZH` in `@object-ui/app-shell`'s metadata-admin `i18n.ts`,
 *      whose key type is `NonNullable<MetadataOverlayScope>` — a scope the spec
 *      adds fails to compile there until it has a zh-CN label, which is the
 *      user-visible half of this bug.

// the INSTALLED `@objectstack/spec`, and the Spec Main Shape Gate against one
// built from objectstack `main`. The two vocabularies differ today: objectstack
// PR #22628 (objectstack#15206 S5, ADR-0131) narrowed `overlayScope` on `main`
// to `env`, while the installed release still declares `org | env`. So the
// expected set is READ OFF THE SCHEMA VALUE, never written down here
// (objectui#12093): each line below holds on either spec and fails on either
// when the alias stops being the spec's.
