/**
 * Locale overlay for the SPEC-DRIVEN property panels (objectui#7254).
 *
 * ## The gap
 *
 * A curated default inspector renders its config fields by feeding
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s canonical authoring form (`dashboardForm`, …) straight
 * into {@link SchemaForm} — deliberately, so a new prop added to the spec shows
 * up with zero code changes here. Those forms are authored in English
 * (`label: 'Layout'`, `helpText: 'Grid gap (Tailwind units)'`), and nothing on
 * this side translated them. Result: a Chinese author editing a dashboard read
 * a fully Chinese Studio with one all-English panel inside it — section
 * headings, every field label, every hint, including developer vocabulary
 * ("Tailwind units") that means nothing to the person the panel is for.
 *
 * ## Why the platform's own resolver, not a second convention
 *
 * The strings belong to the spec, and the platform already declares how they
 * are translated: `metadataForms.<type>.{label,description}`,
 * `.sections.<section>.{label,description}`,
 * `.fields.<dot.path>.{label,helpText,placeholder}` — resolved by
 * `resolveMetadataFormLabels` from `@objectstack/spec/system`, which the
 * framework's own `/meta/types` handler calls to localize the very same forms
 * before serving them. This module supplies a bundle to THAT function rather
 * than inventing a parallel key scheme, so:
 *
 *  - the section-name derivation, the dot-path field addressing and the
 *    composite sub-field synthesis all come from the producer's implementation
 *    (a hand-rolled walker would have had to re-derive `header.showTitle` and
 *    would have got the section names wrong — they are slugged labels, not the
 *    `label` text);
 *  - when the environment's own translation bundle reaches this surface, it
 *    drops in as a higher-precedence source with no call-site change.
 *
 * ## Scope: `en` + `zh`, matching this console's carve-out
 *
 * These entries live beside `./i18n.ts`'s `engine.*` table and share its
 * documented posture (see that file's header and `packages/i18n/README.md`,
 * "Scope — the `engine.*` carve-out"): the metadata designer ships `en` and
 * `zh`, and the other eight shipped locales render the producer's English.
 * `en` is deliberately ABSENT rather than a copy of the spec's sentences — an
 * English console falls through to the producer's own text instead of reading
 * a duplicate this repo would then have to keep in step by hand (the same rule
 * `tOptional` exists for). So this bundle carries `zh-CN` only.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is an OVERLAY, not a fork: a type the bundle does not name, or a field
 * it does not name, is returned untouched.
 *
 * ⛔ One sharp edge, load-bearing for anyone adding a type here: for a
 * `composite` / `repeater` / `record` field the spec resolver SYNTHESIZES the
 * sub-field list from the bundle's direct children of that path, and
 * `SchemaForm` prefers a declared `fields` array over the schema-derived one.
 * Enumerate ALL of a composite's children or none — naming two of three makes
 * the third disappear from the form.
