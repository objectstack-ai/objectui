 * `$orderby: convertSortToQueryParams(schema.sort)`).
 *
 * No `columns` and no row cap are mapped: a map projects the fields its `map`
 * config names (latitude/longitude/title/description) and its fetch issues no
 * `$top`, so neither key has a read site to write to.
 *
 * `filter` here means the query filter and nothing else. `getMapConfig` used to
 * ALSO accept the map's own configuration stashed under `schema.filter.map` (a
 * shape predating the `map` input); that read is gone as of objectui#4034 —
 * the map config is read from the declared `map` input only, and a schema still
 * carrying the legacy stash gets a dev-mode warning instead of silently losing
 * its markers. Nothing here ever relied on it.

// `ObjectMapBlockSchema`, reads the three in its `properties` bag and also
// counts the node's `dataSource` binding, which `ElementDataSourceGate` above
// lands on `objectName`. The input list is a flat declaration with a boolean

//
// `data` and `staticData` are declared (objectui#10394): `ObjectMapSchema`
// declares both, and without an input the html tier's `validateTree` reported
// a block authored on either as `unknown-prop`. Their arms are the schema's:
// `data` is `ViewDataSchema`, a `{ provider, … }` OBJECT — the ladder is called
// on the `'view-data'` arm, so a bare array under `data` is not a record source
// (objectui#8348) and `SchemaRenderer` does not spread it as a prop either —
// and `staticData` is an array of records. Each description names only what
// `ObjectMap` was measured to do with the key, including that the `api`
// provider plots nothing here (`API provider not yet implemented for
// ObjectMap`).
//
// `filter` and `sort` are declared (objectui#8220): `ObjectMap` lowers both onto
// its query (`$filter` / `$orderby`), and `@objectstack/spec`'s `object-map`
// row declares both, so without an input the html tier's `validateTree`
// reported a working key as `unknown-prop`. `filter` is the RULE-ARRAY arm
// only — the spec refuses the MongoDB-style record form at this door, and
// `type: 'array'` makes the html tier refuse it too. Pinned in
// `__tests__/queryKeysDeclared-8220.test.tsx`.
//
// `mapStyle`, `navigation` and `enableClustering` are declared (objectui#11168
// slice 3, objectui#11111 decision 3 = B): `@objectstack/spec` 17.5.0's
// `object-map` row declares all three, the repo-wide registry parity guard now
// loads this plugin and judges the registration, and each was measured honoured
// through the real `SchemaRenderer` first — so without an input the html tier
// reported a working key as `unknown-prop`. Each description states what the
// renderer was measured to do. `mapStyle`'s is the spec row's own describe,
// verbatim: the renderer used to read a `style` inside the `map` block first,
// against that describe ("Read before `map.style`"), and the seat ruled the
// renderer follows the spec (option A) — `getMapConfig` now reads `mapStyle`
// first on every path, pinned both ways. The members
// of every structured key here are pinned in
// `__tests__/objectMapInputs-11168.test.tsx`; `dataSource`'s in
// `ObjectMap.elementDataSource.test.tsx`.
//
// The list is spelled INLINE rather than spread from a shared constant:
// `check:component-surface-parity` cannot name the entries of a spread, so a
// spread list would drop this registration out of that reader's population.
// The declaration is pinned in `index.recordSourceInputs-10394.test.tsx`.

/**
 * ⛔ The bare `map` node type key is RETIRED (objectui#10393, executing the
 * objectui#8008 family ruling of 2026-09-09, route 3). `object-map` is the one
 * spelling this plugin serves.
 *
 * ## What was here, and why it went
 *
 * `ComponentRegistry.register('map', ObjectMapRenderer, { namespace: 'view',
 * ... })` — a second key on the SAME renderer, which stored both `view:map`
 * and the bare `map` fallback. The declared face admitted only one of the two:
 * `ObjectMapSchema.type` is the literal `'object-map'` and `AnyComponentSchema`
 * has no `map` arm, so a node authored `type: 'map'` failed validation
 * (`invalid_union`) while the registry mounted it. Two published faces,
 * opposite verdicts — the shape objectui#8008 retired for `gantt`.
 *
 * ## Why unregistering is the whole retirement here — measured, not assumed
 *
 * ⚠️ `BaseSchemaCore` ends `.passthrough()` (and `BaseSchema` closed with
 * `[key: string]: any` until objectui#8347), so a dropped MEMBER KEY is KEPT,
 * not refused, on the zod face (the objectui#7664 failure). That hazard needs a schema face to arise on, and this
 * TYPE NAME never had one: in `@object-ui/types` the literal `'map'` appears
 * only in the stored view-type unions (`NamedListView.type`,
 * `defaultViewType`), never as a component node type, against a firing control
 * of two for `object-map` (`objectql.ts` + its Zod mirror). There is no arm to
 * convert into a named refusal, so unregistering IS the retirement.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Two layers, and only one of them moved
 *
 * The string `map` also names a STORED `NamedListView.type` — the value
 * `CreateViewDialog` writes and every tenant's database holds. That layer is
 * untouched: `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView` and `plugin-list`'s `ListView` each
 * map a stored `map` view onto the node type they emit (their `case 'map'`
 * branches), and both already emit `object-map`. ⇒ Every map view any user
 * ever created through the console already renders through the surviving
 * spelling; this retirement moves zero stored documents.
 *
 * Pinned in `src/index.bareMapKeyRetired-10393.test.tsx`.
