 * `breadcrumbs` on a `page` NODE is refused at parse, and
 * `content/docs/guide/layout.md` no longer teaches it (objectui#8871, ADR-0049
 * enforce-or-remove).
 *
 * ## What this is, and what it deliberately is NOT
 *
 * objectui#7926 refused `actions` on this same node and, in the same breath,
 * LEFT `breadcrumbs` parsing on purpose — its census had found both, its ruling
 * covered only the first, and `page-actions-refusal-7926.test.ts` carried a pin
 * saying so out loud precisely so that a later retirement could not happen by
 * accident. This file is that retirement; that pin is FLIPPED, not deleted, so
 * the closure stays asserted rather than becoming a silent absence.
 *
 * ⛔ objectui#7926's maintainer ruling is NOT borrowed. By its own comments it
 * covers `actions` and nothing else. What governs this key is the standing
 * ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove discipline, which this repository applies to this
 * exact face: `zod/tombstone.zod.ts`'s `retirementTombstone` is documented as
 * the "ADR-0049 RETIREMENT TOMBSTONE" helper and is internal to these zod
 * modules; 63 changesets cite the ADR; and `PageNodeSchema` already carries one
 * of its refusal arms one member up.
 *
 * ## What was measured — the frame is BASE `93127bd6f`, stated out loud
 *
 * ZERO readers, ⛔ measured with a POINT-ACCESS probe rather than a bare word.
 * On the base, `\.breadcrumbs` scores 0 over the whole tree (exit 1) against 12
 * files tree-wide (10 under `packages/`) for `\.breadcrumb\b` as the lit
 * control. At HEAD those two become 16 and 13, and `\.breadcrumbs` itself turns
 * exit 0 over 4 files / 6 lines — every one of those hits is one of THIS
 * branch's own four files (the changeset, this pin, `layout.ts`,
 * `zod/layout.zod.ts`) matching only because it QUOTES the probe string, and
 * the eight exclusions spelled out at the tree-scoped pin below take HEAD back
 * to exit 1. ⛔ Do not mix the two frames: the base numbers are the
 * measurement, the head numbers are this branch's own echo of it, and no
 * single tree satisfies a sentence that pairs one with the other.
 * The bare word would have lied: it also names Sentry's own unrelated concept
 * (`app-shell/src/observability/sentry.ts`) and appears in two comments
 * listing UI surfaces (`core/src/utils/record-title.ts`,
 * `layout/src/NavigationRenderer.tsx`) — three prose sites, no reader, no
 * declaration, and a bare probe reports "5 readers" that do not exist.
 *
 * THREE author sites, all teaching passages in one file, and the count CORRECTS
 * objectui#7926's "1 site": that census reads every git-tracked JSON file,
 * every `json` fence in `.md`/`.mdx`, and every TS/TSX object literal via the
 * TypeScript AST (PR #8870), and it missed two of the three passages for two
 * DIFFERENT reasons — one passage's literal does carry `type: 'page'` but sits
 * inside a markdown `typescript` fence, a fence LANGUAGE the census's
 * `json`-fence reader never visits, and the other is a `json`-fenced fragment
 * that never writes `type` at all. `the guide teaches the node, not the key`
 * below is that correction as an assertion — it reads the guide by TEXT rather
 * than by parsed page nodes, which sidesteps both blind spots that produced
 * the undercount.
 *
 * ## Why a refusal rather than a reader
 *
 * The remedy already ships as a node: `breadcrumb` is registered
 * (`packages/components/src/renderers/data-display/breadcrumb.tsx`) and its
 * `items` take the very `{ label, href }` shape these passages authored. Growing
 * a second road to the same trail would mint a rival spelling for a vocabulary
 * that already renders.
