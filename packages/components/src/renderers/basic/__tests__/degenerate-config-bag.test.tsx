/**
 * objectui#6783 — the THIRD channel of the degenerate-config-bag hazard: the
 * bag an `element:*` renderer reads, `{ ...schema.props, ...schema.properties }`.
 *
 * `??` only replaces `null`/`undefined`, so a non-object bag went straight into
 * the object spread and was re-read as its own character indices. Five modules
 * under `renderers/basic/` carried a copy of that read — `elements.tsx`,
 * `data-list.tsx`, `text-input.tsx`, `record-picker.tsx`,
 * `metadata-viewer.tsx` — and none of them asked the question
 * `packages/react` converged on one answer for (objectui#6761's `isConfigBag`).
 *
 * ## BASE_READING — measured on `107babef6`, this branch's base
 *
 * Captured by running the legs below against the five pre-fix copies (the fix
 * reverted in the worktree, `readProps.ts` absent), and pasted verbatim:
 *
 *   readProps({ type, properties: 'not-a-bag' })
 *     -> keys ["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8"]
 *   readProps({ type, props: 'not-a-bag' })
 *     -> keys ["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8"]
 *   readProps({ type, props: { content: 'X' }, properties: 'not-a-bag' })
 *     -> keys ["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","content"]
 *   readProps({ type, properties: ['a','b'] })
 *     -> keys ["0","1"]
 *
 * ⇒ nine keys nobody authored, on the same node shape objectui#6752 and
 * objectui#6760 already cleaned upstream.
 *
 * ## What did NOT move, also measured on the same base
 *
 * Ablating this card back to the pre-fix tree — the shared reader's body
 * returned to `?? {}` AND all five modules restored from `107babef6` — moves
 * 7 of the 16 assertions below and leaves 9 standing. Every DOM assertion in
 * "what the guard does not buy" is among the 9. That is the honest reading of this card and it is
 * recorded rather than smoothed over: all five renderers read NAMED keys off
 * this bag, and the single onward spread — `metadata-viewer`'s
 * `<StateMachineView {...props} />` — hands the bag to components that
 * destructure named `ViewerProps` fields. So the indexed keys were computed and
 * then dropped, and no rendered output on this base changes either way. The
 * guard buys what objectui#6752 measured ITS guard buys: the authored value's
 * shape is not reinterpreted. Nothing more, today; the property starts paying
 * the moment one of these five spreads its bag onto a DOM element, which
 * `metadata-viewer` is one refactor away from.
 *
 * ## The three channels are in SERIES, and this leg proves it on this base
 *
 * The probe below drives a node through the REAL `SchemaRenderer`, so both
 * upstream guards are in force, and reads what the renderer actually receives.
 * Measured on `107babef6`: `schema.properties` still holds the authored
 * `'not-a-bag'` when it reaches the component. Upstream does not sanitize this
 * channel — by design (objectui#6752's guard exists to PRESERVE the authored
 * shape) — so the renderer-side read is the only thing that can close it.
