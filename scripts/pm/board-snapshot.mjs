 * board-snapshot — a scheduled, read-only backup of the board (#17390).

 *
 * ## Why this exists, measured rather than supposed
 *
 * Three fleet accounts were suspended in two months. #17374 F3 measured what a
 * suspension destroys: every issue, pull request and comment the account
 * authored — while every branch and commit survives, because those belong to
 * the repository and not to a user. The board IS the fleet's state by rule
 * (pm-dispatch SKILL.md, 全体座位的不变量: 「GitHub 之外永不维护任何跟踪状态」),
 * so one suspension erases state that nothing else holds. Six cards — #17297
 * (a p1 security decision), #17128, #17150, #17276, #17313, #17318 — are gone.
 *
 * ## The one-board rule this obeys, and how it obeys it
 *
 * An ARCHIVE IS NOT A TRACKER. Nothing reads this snapshot for state: no seat,
 * no patrol, no gate, no query. The board stays the single source of truth and
 * every reading of it still goes to GitHub. What this tool produces is a
 * write-once backup that answers exactly one question, after a loss: what did
 * the record say? That is why:
 *
 *   - it has NO write path to GitHub at all — no POST, no PATCH, no DELETE, in
 *     any mode. `--restore` PRINTS a payload; a seat posts it, or nobody does;
 *   - the archive lives on an orphan branch (`board-archive`) of this same
 *     repository — no second repo, no second credential, and it is a branch, so
 *     it survives the suspension that destroys the records;
 *   - the manifest records what the run READ, never what any seat should do.
 *
 * ## Layout — one file per number, so a diff reads like a board
 *
 *   <out>/issues/<n>.json      the issue or pull request record (stable key order)
 *   <out>/comments/<n>.jsonl   its comment thread, one JSON object per line, id-ordered
 *   <out>/reviews/<n>.jsonl    pull requests only: reviews and review comments,
 *                              each line discriminated by its `record` field
 *   <out>/manifest.json        the run stamp, the `since` used, counts by state,
 *                              the board's own `open_issues_count` read in the
 *                              same run, the request count, and the resume cursor
 *   <out>/gone.json            hand-written: numbers known to be destroyed or
 *                              transferred, so the count check below can stay a
 *                              real alarm instead of a permanent red
 *
 * Every record is built key by key in a fixed order and every list is sorted, so
 * two runs over an unchanged board produce byte-identical files and the branch's
 * history is a diff of what actually changed on the board.
 *
 * ## Open first — the walk order, and why it is not a preference
 *
 * The first walk is the one that matters and it used to be the wrong way round.
 * Measured on the first scheduled run of this tool: the listing ascends by
 * update time from the beginning of the board, so 800 requests bought 137 closed
 * issues and 268 closed pull requests from February — and ZERO open cards, with
 * days of runs still to go. The records a suspension destroys are the OPEN
 * board: that is the whole reason this file exists (#17374 F3), and it was the
 * half being archived last.
 *
 * So a first walk runs in two phases, and `walk_phase` in the manifest names
 * which one a reader is looking at:
 *
 *   open         `state=open`, issues AND pull requests (the `/issues` listing
 *                carries both), walked to a short page. Nothing else starts
 *                until this finishes — a run that runs out of budget inside the
 *                open set resumes INSIDE it.
 *   history      `state=all` from the stored history cursor: the closed record,
 *                which has no other reader anywhere. Only reachable once the
 *                open set is complete. A DELTA walk runs FIRST inside this
 *                phase (below) and the backfill takes what it leaves.
 *   incremental  the steady state, once the whole board has been walked once:
 *                one `since` walk from the delta's high-water mark. In this
 *                phase the phase walk IS the delta, with the whole budget.
 *
 * An archive written before this order existed carries no `walk` block; its
 * cursor is a HISTORY cursor, so it is kept rather than discarded and the open
 * set is walked first from there. ⛔ The open and history walks are never
 * interleaved: the point is that after one run of the open phase the open board
 * is on disk.
 *
 * ## Delta first — the live board is re-read EVERY run, not after the backfill
 *
 * Measured on the 2026-09-13T14:22Z scheduled run (#18045). The open set had
 * been complete since 2026-09-10T15:39Z, the history cursor had reached
 * 2026-08-03, and every run since had spent all 800 requests walking February
 * forward at `stopped_by: budget`. The highest number in the archive was 17460:
 * #18010, #18020, #18025 — and the twelve cards an account suspension destroyed
 * that same morning — were in no snapshot at all, because the phase order only
 * reaches `incremental` once the history is COMPLETE, which was weeks away at
 * that pace. This file exists to answer one question after a loss, and on the
 * day of a loss it answered nothing.
 *
 * So the order INSIDE a run is delta, then backfill. The delta is a `state=all`
 * walk from the archive's own high-water mark over the live board, archiving
 * every row it sees, open or closed, issue or pull request. It runs on every run
 * once the open set is complete, ahead of the history backfill and ⛔ never
 * after it: a backfill always spends whatever it is given, so a delta placed
 * behind one is a delta that never runs.
 *
 * **The split of the budget, and why 300 of 800.** The delta walks under a SLICE
 * of the run budget (`DELTA_REQUEST_SLICE`); the backfill gets the remainder:
 *
 *   - a quiet six-hour window moves a few dozen numbers, so a steady-state delta
 *     costs one listing page plus a comment read per changed number — nowhere
 *     near the slice, and the backfill keeps very nearly the whole 800;
 *   - a CATCH-UP delta (this fix landing on a three-day gap, or any run after an
 *     outage) archives on the order of 250 numbers inside 300 requests, so a
 *     multi-day gap closes in a day of scheduled runs rather than in the weeks
 *     the backfill needs to reach the same rows;
 *   - and 500 requests still reach the backfill in the worst case, so a busy
 *     board slows the closed history to five eighths of its pace instead of
 *     stopping it. ⛔ An unbounded delta is not an option here: a board that
 *     moves faster than one run can read would starve the backfill forever.
 *
 * A spent SLICE is not a run stop. The delta records its cursor, the backfill
 * continues with the remaining budget, and the next run resumes the delta where
 * it stopped. Only the run budget and a rate-limit refusal stop a run, exactly
 * as before.
 *
 * **Where the delta starts**, in order: its own stored cursor — the exact
 * high-water mark, and `since` is inclusive, so the boundary row is re-read and
 * re-written identically; or, for an archive written before this walk existed,
 * the instant the open set was last enumerated IN FULL
 * (`walk.open_set.completed_at`) minus a skew. That instant is the last moment
 * this archive is known to have matched the live board. Anchoring on the
 * previous run's `generated_at` instead would declare a window the tool never
 * walked — on the manifest above, three days of board activity would have been
 * skipped by the very walk added to stop skipping it. The skew
 * (`DELTA_SKEW_MS`) covers one run's own duration: a row updated after a walk
 * read past it but before that run stamped its manifest sits in exactly that
 * window.
 *
 * **What the delta buys the count check.** A delta that reaches a short page has
 * archived every row that moved since the open set was enumerated, so the census
 * on disk IS the live open board and the count check is a reading again. In the
 * history phase it had been permanently `pending`, and on a multi-week backfill
 * that is a count check that never runs.
 *
 * ## Incremental, and the two things that makes exact
 *
 * A run reads `since` from the previous manifest (`next_since`, or the phase
 * cursor when the previous run stopped early) and asks the listing endpoint for
 * everything updated at or after it. The first run has no manifest, so it walks
 * the open set and then the whole history. Once a delta has run, `next_since` is
 * the DELTA's high-water mark rather than the backfill's, so the handover from
 * the history phase to the steady state carries no gap: the cursor the steady
 * state starts from is the one the live board was last read to.
 *
 * **The page walk never trusts `Link: rel="next"`.** The REST channel table
 * records the measurement: cursor-following stopped at 102 rows where the page
 * walk found 287 and 448, and the enumerations that were wrong looked exactly
 * like the ones that were right. So this walks `&page=N` until a SHORT page
 * (fewer rows than `per_page`) ends it, and nothing else ends it.
 *
 * **The walk re-anchors on a VALUE, never on an offset.** Ascending by
 * `updated_at`, an item that is updated mid-walk moves to the end of the
 * ordering and shifts every row behind it one slot forward — so the row that
 * was about to be the first of page k+1 lands at the last slot of page k, which
 * this run has already read past. Blind `page += 1` skips it PERMANENTLY: its
 * own `updated_at` never moved, so no later `since` window contains it either.
 * `nextWalkStep()` therefore sets `since` to the last row's `updated_at` and
 * returns to page 1 whenever that value advances, and increments the page only
 * when a whole page shares one timestamp (which is the only case an offset is
 * needed for). `since` is inclusive, so the boundary rows are re-read and
 * re-written identically — an over-read, which is the safe direction.
 *
 * ## Rate discipline — stop with a cursor, never retry in a loop
 *
 * The workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` is budgeted at 1,000 requests/hour PER
 * REPOSITORY. A first full snapshot of this board (~600 open issues and several
 * thousand closed ones, each with a comment thread) does not fit one run and
 * must not try: `--max-requests` stops the run cleanly, writes the manifest with
 * a `resume` cursor and exits 0, and the next scheduled run continues from that
 * cursor. Four runs a day walk the backlog in a few days without ever exceeding
 * the budget.
 *
 * A real rate-limit signal from GitHub (403/429 with the remaining count at
 * zero) is different and is NOT a planned pause: the run stops, writes the same
 * resume cursor, prints the reset time and exits `EXIT_RATE_LIMITED`. ⛔ It
 * never sleeps and never retries the request — a loop against a zero budget is
 * how one repository's automation starves every other caller of that budget.
 *
 * ## The count check, and why a mismatch is red rather than a warning
 *
 * `rest-channel.md`: an enumeration without a count check is not a reading. So
 * every run censuses the archive on disk and compares the open-issue count with
 * the board's own `open_issues_count` minus the open pull requests, both read in
 * the same run.
 *
 *   SHORTFALL (the archive holds fewer)  the enumeration missed cards. This is
 *                                        the failure the rule exists for.
 *   SURPLUS   (the archive holds more)   the board no longer carries records
 *                                        this archive does — the destruction
 *                                        signature this tool was built for.
 *                                        `--restore` prints them back; a number
 *                                        deliberately left destroyed (or moved
 *                                        to another repo) goes in `gone.json`,
 *                                        which is the ONLY way to quiet it.
 *
 * Both are non-zero exits. `pending` is the third answer and not a pass — what
 * keeps "could not check" apart from "checked and clean" (#4690) — and the
 * predicate for it is the OPEN SET, because the arithmetic above needs nothing
 * else: the check is a reading exactly when THIS run enumerated the open board
 * (the run that finishes the open phase, or any run whose walk completed), and
 * `pending` with a stated reason otherwise. A run in the history phase reports
 * `pending` even though the open set is complete, and the reason says why: that
 * enumeration is from an earlier run, so every card closed or opened since then
 * is still archived in its old state and a verdict would be an alarm about the
 * clock rather than about the board.
 *
 * ## Stale is not green — the freshness row
 *
 * `pending` keeps "could not check" apart from "checked and clean", and until
 * this row existed that distinction went no further than the manifest: the exit
 * code is built from the count check's `ok`, and `pending` leaves that `null`,
 * so a run that archived days-old state exited 0 and the workflow step that
 * reads the exit code never fired. Measured on this repository's own archive —
 * the 21 manifests `board-archive` has ever carried: NINETEEN consecutive runs
 * reported `pending`, 2026-09-10T20:23Z through 2026-09-14T20:24Z, and every
 * scheduled run over that window is `success` in the Actions history. Among
 * them 2026-09-14T02:37Z, whose delta cursor was 2026-09-12T00:40Z — two days
 * behind the live board, on the morning an account suspension destroyed cards
 * the archive did not hold (#18137). A backup that is behind is the one case
 * this file exists to prevent, and it was the case reporting success.
 *
 * So a run answers one more question: is this archive still level with the
 * live board?
 *
 *   building  the open board has never been enumerated in full. There is no
 *             reading to age yet, the open-set line already says so, and a
 *             first snapshot is not a stale one. Every `pull_request` run of
 *             the workflow is here too — it walks into a temp dir with no
 *             manifest under a `--limit`, and it stays green.
 *   fresh     this run reached a count-check VERDICT, so the census on disk and
 *             the board's own count named one instant — or it did not, and the
 *             streak of runs that did not is still inside the window below.
 *   stale     no run has reached a verdict for longer than that window. The run
 *             exits `EXIT_STALE`, the workflow step reads the code, the row
 *             goes red.
 *
 * **The anchor is the streak's START, never the delta cursor** — measured, and
 * the literal reading is a false-alarm generator. `walk.delta.cursor` is the
 * `updated_at` of the newest row the delta archived, not the instant the board
 * was last read: an empty page is a short page, `nextWalkStep` ends the walk
 * returning the cursor it was given, and so on a quiet board the delta
 * completes every run, the archive is exactly level, and that cursor sits as
 * far in the past as the last card anyone touched. Ageing it reds a board for
 * being quiet — driven in `--self-test`, not argued. What ages honestly is
 * `freshness.pending_since`: the stamp of the first run of the current streak
 * of runs that could not confirm the archive against the board.
 *
 * **And a stamp rather than a counter, for a reason the manifest already
 * states.** A count of consecutive runs moves on every run, and
 * `materialManifest` exists because a value that moves every run commits a
 * manifest-only diff on every scheduled run and buries the real ones. A streak
 * start is written once when the streak opens, carried forward byte-identical
 * for as long as it lasts, and cleared when a verdict returns: two manifest
 * writes per incident, and idempotence survives intact.
 *
 * **Why a day.** `STALE_AFTER_MS` is measured from the first UNCONFIRMED run,
 * and that run is itself one schedule interval after the last confirmed one, so
 * the red lands a day plus one interval after the archive was last known level
 * — on the four-a-day cron, the 30 hours the card asked for. The calibration is
 * from those same 21 manifests: the one legitimate catch-up in this archive's
 * history — a bounded delta slice closing a three-day gap after #18045 — ran
 * from 2026-09-13T20:23Z to 2026-09-15T02:34Z, 30 h 04 m, and every run inside
 * it held an archive that did not have the newest cards. So this window never
 * reds a single stalled run, never reds a day-long gap, reds the tail of a
 * worst-case catch-up, and reds every run of the four-day streak the card was
 * filed on.
 *
 * ⛔ What this row does NOT do is prescribe the remedy. More runs, a larger
 * budget and a wider delta slice are the maintainer's decisions and are named
 * nowhere in the verdict; what the summary prints is what CLEARS it — the first
 * run whose delta catches up and whose count check reports a verdict again.
 * ⛔ Nor does it hold the archive back: the workflow commits and mirrors what
 * the run read BEFORE the step that reads this exit code, because a stale
 * archive is still better than none.
 *
 * ⚠️ It reds a RUN, so it cannot red the ABSENCE of runs — a schedule that
 * stopped firing is still read off the Actions history, below.
 *
 * ## Heartbeat
 *
 * ⚠️ Unlike the half-state patrol, this run does NOT refresh a timestamp when
 * nothing changed — idempotence is the card's requirement and a per-run no-op
 * commit would bury the real diffs. The liveness signal is therefore the Actions
 * run history and each run's job summary, NOT the archive. A reader asking "is
 * the backup alive?" reads the workflow, never the branch.
 *
 * ## Adopting this in a sibling repo
 *
 * Copy FOUR files, unchanged — this one, `.github/workflows/board-snapshot.yml`,
 * `scripts/pm/check-half-states.mjs` (the proxy re-exec plan and the repo
 * resolver are imported from it, so a three-file copy installs an archiver that
 * cannot start) and `scripts/invoked-as.mjs` (imported by both). A repo that has
 * already adopted the half-state patrol has the last two. ⛔ Do not shorten this
 * list from memory: the imports below decide it, not this comment.
 *
 * There is no configuration. The board archived is `github.repository`, passed
 * explicitly by the workflow — and this script REFUSES the default repository
 * its resolver would otherwise fall back to, because a copy that quietly
 * archived the repo it was copied FROM would produce a complete, well-formed,
 * green archive of the wrong board.
