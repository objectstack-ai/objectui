/**
 * objectui#10765 — the package OWD overview reads and re-saves an object's
 * pending draft AS-IS. It never spreads the draft over `layered.effective`.
 *
 * `effective` is the PUBLISHED layer and a spread cannot express deletion, so
 * an OWD model the author had set back to unset in the draft (a real authored
 * state — `PackageOwdOverviewPanel.test.tsx` pins that clearing a model DROPS
 * the key) read as still set from the published row, and the next OWD save
 * wrote that published value, plus every other key the draft had deleted,
 * back into the object's draft. Same host-level cause as the metadata-admin
 * editor's merge; the panel has two sites — the list load that derives each
 * row's values and the save that splices the edit into the body — and both
 * are pinned here, one assertion each, red on base.
 *
 * The client is a server double: `effective` is the active row, `getDraft`
 * serves the stored draft row raw, `save` records the wire body.
