/**
 * objectui#8924 — the test for the installed-pin claim gate.
 *
 * ## Why the controls are shaped the way they are
 *
 * objectui#8897 corrected the "the pin is 17.3.0" sentences with a probe that
 * was version-literal on `17.3.0`. It could not have found the identical
 * sentence about 17.2.0, and it did not. The instrument, not the sentences, is
 * what this file is about — so every refusal below is demonstrated on a REAL
 * line of this tree, LOCATED AT RUN TIME by a stable substring rather than
 * copied in, and every refusal is paired with a FIRING CONTROL: the same line,
 * minimally mutated, which the recogniser DOES flag.
 *
 * ⚠️ The pairing is the whole point. A refusal shown only on lines where
 * nothing could have fired is not evidence of a distinction — it is evidence of
 * a probe that never fires, which passes exactly as green.
