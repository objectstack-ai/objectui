/**
 * Neither SVG-hosted renderer puts an authored schema prop on the DOM, and
 * neither stopped putting a REAL one there (objectui#5632, the
 * `BARE_SPREAD_ON_SVG` slice of objectui#5574).
 *
 * ## What this measures that the sweep gate cannot
 *
 * The same split the two probes next door describe
 * (`layout-dom-leak-5574.test.tsx`, `form-control-dom-leak-5632.test.tsx`).
 * `packages/app-shell/src/__tests__/widget-dom-leak-sweep.test.tsx` is the gate
 * for this class and the stronger instrument for the OPEN TAIL — it plants
 * canary keys no schema declares. What it does not plant are the renderers' OWN
 * DECLARED PROPS: its canary node authors no `icon`, no `size`, no `color`.
 * Adding them there would rewrite the measured attribute set of the renderers
 * still ledgered, i.e. destroy the arrival reading that file preserves.
 *
 * For this group the declared half is the whole catalog-scale reading:
 * `icon[icon]` is 71 of the 71 attributes measured before the fix — the glyph
 * key the renderer CONSUMES to pick the component and then forwarded to the
 * element as well.
 *
 * ## The half a leak gate cannot see, which on an SVG host is most of it
 *
 * A leak gate reports attributes that ARRIVE illegitimately. It has no case for
 * one that STOPS arriving — and this is the group where that blind spot is
 * widest, because `@object-ui/test-support`'s judge counts `stroke`, `width`,
 * `height`, `fill` and `color` as legitimate on an SVG host. Everything lucide
 * emits therefore sits in the judge's legitimate half, invisible in BOTH
 * directions.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical blind spot here. Two of this slice's three
 * measured behaviour changes live inside it, and one of them was a live defect:
 *
 *   - `spinner` declares `size` as an ENUM (`sm`/`md`/`lg`/`xl`) and consumes it
 *     through `sizeClasses`. The bare spread ALSO handed the string to lucide's
 *     numeric `size` prop, so a `size: 'lg'` node carried `width="lg"
 *     height="lg"` — invalid SVG dimensions, on every spinner in the catalog
 *     that sets a size, moving no number the gate watches.
 *   - `icon` declares `color` as a Tailwind CLASS ("Color Class") and applies it
 *     through `cn()`. The spread also reached lucide's `color` prop, emitting
 *     `stroke="text-red-500"` — an invalid paint value — beside the class doing
 *     the real work. All three `color` values authored in this catalog are
 *     classes, so nothing depended on the raw-CSS-colour accident.
 *
 * So the assertions below pin the LEGITIMATE attributes too, not just a zero.
 * A zero leak reading plus an unpinned legitimate set is exactly how the
 * sibling slice could have un-named and re-enabled every form control while its
 * gate went green.
 *
 * ## Designing against the failure mode this test could have
 *
 * A zero means nothing on its own: a renderer that renders NOTHING spreads
 * nothing and reads clean, and so does a walk that found no nodes. Three
 * guards, the same three the sibling probe carries:
 *
 *   1. NODE COUNTS are asserted, per type, against the census below — read
 *      IDENTICAL in the before and after runs, so the after-zero is a reading
 *      and not a walk that stopped finding nodes.
 *   2. `ui:grid` is measured in the SAME run as a CONTROL. Converged by
 *      objectui#4787 / PR #5573, it reads 0 in every configuration of this test,
 *      so on its own it discriminates nothing; what it does is read 0 in the
 *      same run in which `icon` read 71.
 *   3. The JUDGE is self-checked for ELEMENT-AWARENESS, in the direction THIS
 *      file depends on: an SVG host and an HTML host must disagree about the
 *      same bag. A judge that allowed `color`/`width` everywhere — or one that
 *      lowercased SVG attribute names — would pass every assertion below while
 *      seeing none of this group.
 *
 * ## Why each node is rendered without its children
 *
 * `findLeaks` walks the whole subtree, so a node's nested SDUI children get
 * their leaks attributed to the parent (measured next door: subtree scanning
 * put 61 attributes on `grid`, the CONTROL, all from child nodes of other
 * mechanism groups). Rendering each node with `children`/`body` removed scopes
 * the reading to the renderer's own markup; nothing is lost, because the walk
 * collects nested nodes of the measured types separately.
 *
 * Module-scope import of `@object-ui/components`, not `beforeAll` (AGENTS.md
 * §测试纪律): registering the renderers is an unbounded module load and must not
 * be billed to a bounded hook timeout.
