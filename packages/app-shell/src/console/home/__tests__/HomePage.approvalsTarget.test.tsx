/**
 * Home "pending approvals" card — where it actually lands (objectstack#7231).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `HomePage` hardcoded `navigate('/apps/setup/system/approvals')`. The path is
 * not wrong about the PAGE — `system/approvals` is declared in the host's route
 * fragment and mounted as both `extraRoutes` and `extraRoutesNoApp`, so
 * `/apps/{ANY_APP}/system/approvals` resolves — it is wrong about the APP. A
 * business user who has approvals to act on but no access to the `setup` app
 * follows the one entry point Home offers them straight into the shell's "App
 * not available" guard.
 *
 * `InboxPopover` (the bell in the app chrome) already got this right:
 * `currentAppName ?? params.appName`, falling back to `setup` only when neither
 * names an app. This file pins the same resolution for Home.
 *
 * ## Why Home cannot simply copy the popover
 *
 * Home renders at `/home`, OUTSIDE the `/apps/:appName/*` router, so the second
 * half of the popover's expression (`params.appName`) is structurally
 * unavailable — there is no app segment in the URL to read. `currentAppName` is
 * the only signal, it is published by `ConsoleLayout` on app mount, and it is
 * therefore *stale by construction*: on a cold landing straight at `/home` it is
 * `undefined`, and after visiting an app it survives that app being deactivated.
 * Both of those are cases below, and both are why the resolution re-checks the
 * remembered name against the LIVE active-app list instead of trusting it.
 *
 * ## Scope of the stubs
 *
 * This file measures ONE navigation target. Every hook `HomePage` calls for
 * unrelated surfaces (AI CTAs, drafts banner, recents, favorites) is stubbed at
 * its module boundary; `HomeRail` — which owns the card and its testid — stays
 * real, because "the click reaches the right URL" is not assertable through a
 * stubbed button. `useNavigate` is mocked rather than driven through a
 * `MemoryRouter` so the assertion reads the emitted target directly, matching
 * `CloudOnboardingNext.test.tsx` in this same directory.

/* ── The `_drafts` double (objectui#7307) ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Every render of `HomePage` below mounts `PendingDraftsBanner`, which reads the
 * env-wide pending-draft count through `usePendingDrafts({})`. That hook fetches
 * `GET /api/v1/meta/_drafts` with the GLOBAL `fetch` — `usePendingDrafts.ts:48`,
 * no `apiFetch` seam anywhere on the path — from its mount effect
 * (`usePendingDrafts.ts:116` via `refresh` at `:94`). Under happy-dom that global
 * is a real HTTP client and the document URL defaults to `http://localhost:3000`,
 * so the relative path resolved to a live socket, once per case. The hook's read
 * is best-effort (its `catch` leaves `count` at `null`), which is why these cases
 * stayed green while the request always failed.
 *
 * Answered from a RECORDING double — the shape objectui#5225 settled on, carried
 * by `packages/plugin-report/src/__tests__/DatasetReportRenderer.test.tsx` and by
 * this burn-down's earlier batches. Deliberately NOT a blanket network stub: it
 * records every URL it is handed and `afterEach` fails on any URL outside the set
 * it serves, so an escape to somewhere else reds here instead of vanishing into
 * that `catch`.
 *
 * What it answers, and why that changes no assertion here: a known-EMPTY draft
 * ledger, in the `{ drafts: [...] }` envelope `fetchPendingDrafts` reads (the one
 * `MetadataClient.listDrafts` pins for this endpoint; the bare-array and
 * `{ data: { drafts } }` shapes parse to the same rows). Empty rather than seeded
 * is load-bearing: `PendingDraftsBanner` renders `null` when `(count ?? 0) <= 0`,
 * and the failing request produced `count === null` — so an empty ledger yields
 * byte-identical output to what these cases have always rendered, while a seeded
 * one would add a banner and a `pending-drafts-publish` button to every case's
 * tree. Routes are matched on the PATHNAME because the hook appends a
 * `?packageId=` scope for package-bound callers; the full URL is what gets
 * recorded.
