/**
 * objectui#4252 — an app the session may not open must be distinguishable from
 * an app that is not there.
 *
 * The app LIST is the generic metadata list route `GET /api/v1/meta/:type`
 * requested with the singular type segment `app`, and the server filters it per
 * session in `filterAppForUser` (`packages/rest/src/rest-server.ts`), so those
 * two conditions are byte-identical in the list: both are simply absent. The
 * maintainer ruling (2026-08-12) put the
 * distinction on the BY-NAME route instead of flagging the list — the
 * enumeration surface is not widened past what a by-name probe already implies
 * — and objectstack#8013 (PR #8135) shipped it:
 *
 *   - EXISTS + session lacks `requiredPermissions` → `403`
 *     `{ success: false, error: { code: 'PERMISSION_DENIED', message } }`
 *   - an unpublished app (ADR-0045 §3 keeps it externally unobservable), an app
 *     gated by an absent optional service (ADR-0057 D10 — nothing was denied to
 *     the CALLER) → `404 RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`.
 *   - ⭐ a name that resolves to NOTHING → `200` with the declared envelope
 *     MINUS its `item`. Measured on a real server while implementing
 *     objectui#9262 (showcase example, `objectstack` 60b9955, API 17.4.0);
 *     this file previously asserted a 404 here and the assertion was wrong
 *     about the server, not about the code. Both are absence.
 *
 * ## objectui#9262 — the verdicts this file now pins
 *
 * `probeAppAccess` used to answer `granted` whenever the call did not throw,
 * which made every nonexistent app `granted` on a live server, and folded a 404
 * absence together with an unreachable server into one `unknown`. The verdict
 * set widened by two members (`not_found`, `unreachable`) and `unknown` was
 * narrowed to "nothing was asked". Each case below names which answer produced
 * which verdict, because the whole point of the widening is that the screen
 * above it says only what was obtained.
 *
 * Every case here goes through the real `ObjectStackClient` over a stubbed
 * `fetch`, so what is measured includes the client's own error stamping
 * (`error.code` off `body.error.code`, `error.httpStatus` off the status) —
 * the seam a hand-built rejection would have skipped straight past.
 *
 * The discrimination is on the ADR-0112 CODE, never the status (objectui#4408),
 * and the last two cases are what hold that: they cross the two apart, so a
 * reimplementation that reads `httpStatus === 403` goes red in both directions
 * rather than passing on the happy path.

/**
 * objectui#4940 — `getApp` and `getPage` used to address the SAME metadata
 * types this file already pins (`probeAppAccess` above asserts `app`,
 * singular, at line 96) but through the plural collection spelling
 * (`'apps'` / `'pages'`). Both resolved today only because the server folds
 * plural → singular (`RestServer.metaTypeSingular`, `PLURAL_TO_SINGULAR` from
 * `@objectstack/spec/shared`) — so the drift was unexercised, not
 * latent-broken, but nothing asserted either spelling for these two sites.
 * Extending THIS file's pin (rather than opening a new one) keeps the
 * app-type spelling guard in one place: `probeAppAccess` and `getApp`
 * address the same type sixty lines apart in `index.ts`, and a reader should
 * find both assertions together.
 *
 * Unlike `probeAppAccess`, both methods call `connect()` first, which issues
 * its own `/api/v1/discovery` fetch — so asserting on the raw `fetch` mock's
 * first call (the line-96 shape) would race against that unrelated request.
 * These stub `client.meta.getItem` directly instead (the pattern already
 * used by `updateView.draft.test.ts`) and assert the type argument the
 * adapter actually passed, which is a strictly stronger pin than a URL
 * substring: it fails on ANY non-singular spelling, not just `'apps'`.
