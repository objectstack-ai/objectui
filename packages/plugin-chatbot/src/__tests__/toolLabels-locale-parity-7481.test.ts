 * on a zh console: `get_authoring_rules` (cloud#1837) had no `chatbot.tool.*`
 * entry, so `humanizeToolName` fell through to its English title-caser — the
 * exact cloud#1658 symptom, one tool at a time, and it recurs every time the
 * cloud AI packages register a tool.
 *
 * The registry (`@objectstack/spec`'s `PLATFORM_TOOLS_BY_PACKAGE`) is the
 * contract, so it is what this suite reads. The pinned spec could LAG the cloud
 * runtime, and a step label the user reads must not wait on a pin bump, so the
 * coverage set is `registry ∪ AHEAD_OF_PIN` — a hand-held escape hatch for names
 * the snapshot has not listed yet. A member the registry has caught up with must
 * be REMOVED from that list, which the last case here enforces, so the hand-held
 * half shrinks rather than growing into a second, permanent registry.
 *
 * ⭐ IT HAS SHRUNK TO NOTHING, AND THAT IS THE MECHANISM WORKING. The five names
 * this file was written around — `get_authoring_rules` (cloud#1837),
 * `load_tools`, `open_record`, `test_flow`, `toggle_flow` — are all in
 * `PLATFORM_TOOLS_BY_PACKAGE` as of `@objectstack/spec` 17.4.0, so
 * {@link AHEAD_OF_PIN} is empty and coverage is the registry alone
 * (objectui#8772 took the pin there). ⛔ The list is kept, not deleted: the next
 * tool the cloud registers ahead of a snapshot needs the same hatch, and
 * rebuilding it under pressure is how a permanent second registry starts.
 * {@link GRADUATED} keeps this file's guards honest while the list is empty —
 * see its note.
 *
 * The English pin is the other half. The packs' own comment states the rule —
 * "the `en` values are deliberately EQUAL to what that title-caser produces:
 * adding the key must not silently reword the English UI" — and nothing
 * checked it until now, so an `en` entry could quietly change what an English
 * console has always said.
