/**
 * The ONE predicate scope this tier binds — the single declaration of what an

 *
 * ADR-0068 D1: expose the SAME user object under the canonical `current_user`
 * plus the back-compat `user` alias, the server-RLS-parity `ctx.user` alias,
 * and the server-CEL-parity `os.user` alias (the spec's canonical identity
 * scope — `{{os.user.id}}` per @objectstack/spec expression docs), so a
 * predicate authored against any one form evaluates identically on client,
 * server-formula, and server-RLS (#2358 trap 1). D1 names a client `visible`
 * gate as one of the three surfaces that must agree.
 *
 * ## Why this is a function and not three literals
 *
 * It was three literals, and they drifted (objectui#6493). `ExpressionProvider`
 * built the full bag, while `RecordFormPage` and `AppContent` each built a
 * private `new ExpressionEvaluator({ user, app, data })` for the SAME kind of
 * gate — an object field's `visible` — beside the provider they never read.
 * Those bags bound `user` but not the other three spellings of the same object,
 * and not `features` at all, so ONE authored predicate meant two things
 * depending on which evaluator reached it: `current_user` resolved on a nav
 * item and FAULTED on a field, and a fault fails OPEN (`evaluateVisibility`
 * below), which is indistinguishable on screen from a gate that said yes.
 * A copy of the bag is how that recurs; a call is not.
 *
 * `features` is renderer-tier, not contract — the same posture `@objectstack/
 * spec`'s `page.zod.ts` documents for component `visibleWhen` ("the shipping
 * renderer additionally mounts `app`, `features`, `os.user` … renderer
 * behaviour, NOT contract-guaranteed"). It is bound here because it is what
 * THIS tier's own diagnostic advice tells an author they may name. That quote
 * still names `app`; this tier no longer mounts it — see below.
 *
 * ## Why there is no `app` root (objectui#8155, ruled 2026-09-07)
 *
 * There was one, and it was a root the protocol never declared. ADR-0068
 * declares `current_user` with the `user` / `ctx.user` aliases and nothing
 * named `app`; `@objectstack/formula`'s `SCOPE_ROOTS` (`cel-engine.ts`) has no
 * `app` either. So an authored `app.name == 'crm'` was bound HERE and refused
 * by the engine that lints it — an editor advertising a root its own linter
 * rejects, with the nonsense remedy `record.app` and no spelling that both
 * lints clean and resolves.
 *
 * The ruling is that the engine's `SCOPE_ROOTS` is the contract and this
 * consumer aligns to it, NOT that the engine grows a root to match this
 * consumer. Option A — widen the engine vocabulary — was the producer-side
 * card objectstack#16420, and the same ruling CLOSED it `not_planned`
 * (2026-09-07T04:16:22Z). Should a real need for a "current app" root ever be
 * measured, it is a fresh spec/engine vocabulary widening; there is no open
 * record waiting for it. ⛔ The other refused route was suppressing the
 * diagnostic in `celAuthoring.ts`: that is the lenient-fallback shape
 * AGENTS.md #0.1 bans.
 *
 * ## Why there is no `data` root either (objectui#8166, ruled 2026-09-10)
 *
 * `app` and `data` came off the same list producing OPPOSITE failures, and the
 * `data` half is the nastier one.
 *
 * objectui#5741 (Phase 2 of the objectui#5330 canon) retired `data.*` on
 * runtime record surfaces: the row is bound as `record.*` and nothing else, and
 * `@object-ui/core`'s `evaluator/rowPredicateCanon.ts` records the server's
 * verdict for the retired spelling — `data.status` is `❌ Unknown variable:
 * data`. But `@objectstack/formula`'s `SCOPE_ROOTS` still contains `data`, so
 * at `scope: 'record'` the AUTHORING LINT accepts `data.status == 'x'`. An
 * ambient `data` bound HERE is what let that accepted-by-the-linter predicate
 * also resolve at runtime — against this bag rather than against the row.
 *
 * Measured on `origin/main` before the removal, one authored
 * `visibleWhen: "data.status == 'x'"` meant three different things depending on
 * which of this tier's bags reached it:
 *
 *   - against `data: {}` (what every `ExpressionProvider` mount passes, and
 *     what `RecordFormPage`'s own evaluator built) the engine answered
 *     `[runtime] No such key: status` — a fault, so the field-rule fallback
 *     applied: fail-OPEN for `visibleWhen`;
 *   - against `data: editingRecord` (what `AppContent`'s field-list evaluator
 *     built for the global record-form modal, in EDIT mode) it RESOLVED, with
 *     no diagnostic at all — the wrong-layer root silently answering from the
 *     host's record;
 *   - in CREATE mode on that same modal `editingRecord` is null, so the same
 *     predicate fell back to the first case.
 *
 * A root that answers three ways and is never the row is not a root. Removing
 * it collapses all three onto the engine's own verdict — `[type] Unknown
 * variable: data`, byte-identical in shape to the `app` diagnostic above — and
 * `record.*`, the canon, is unaffected.
 *
 * ⛔ Two routes the ruling refused. De-advertising `data` from an
 * advertised-roots list fixes nothing: it stops autocomplete RECOMMENDING the
 * root while the lint still ACCEPTS it, so every already-authored `data.*`
 * predicate stays green and stays wrong. And ⛔ filtering the diagnostic in
 * `celAuthoring.ts` is treating the wrong layer — there is no diagnostic to
 * filter, the absence of one is the defect. Splitting `SCOPE_ROOTS` per scope
 * is the producer-side half and lives in `@objectstack/formula`, not here.
 *
 * The one `data` that survives this tier is the metadata-admin form's, and it
 * is a different object one layer up: `views/metadata-admin/predicate.ts`
 * binds `data` = the DRAFT under edit through its own builder (ADR-0089 D3,
 * `CANONICAL_ROOT_BY_LAYER` = `{ runtime: 'record', metadata: 'data' }`), takes
 * only the identity roots from this bag, and assigns its own `data` last. It is
 * unaffected by this removal, by construction.
 *
 * Every root below is one the engine accepts AND one this tier can actually
 * answer, so the three surfaces — what this binds, what the editor advertises,
 * what the linter admits — now agree.

/**
 * The `type` slot of the shared visibility-fault reporter, for THIS surface
 * (objectui#6443).
 *
 * ## Why the slot needed a decision at all
 *
 * `reportUnresolvableVisibilityPredicate` (@object-ui/react, objectui#6038)
 * dedupes on `(type, key, predicate source)` — `id` rides along in the printed
 * line but is deliberately NOT in the key. So whatever goes in `type` sets this
 * site's RATE LIMIT, and a nav item is not a schema node: there is no
 * `schema.type` to hand over.
 *
 * ## Why a CONSTANT, and not the item's identity
 *
 * The choice is between a constant (one line per distinct authored predicate
 * SOURCE) and something per-item (one line per menu entry). Measured against
 * the three cases that can actually occur:
 *
 *   - two entries, two different broken predicates -> BOTH keys already differ
 *     on `source`, so both report either way. No difference.
 *   - two entries sharing ONE broken predicate (the copy-pasted role gate, the
 *     common shape) -> a constant reports ONCE, which is correct: it is one
 *     authoring mistake, in one string, fixed in one edit. A per-item key would
 *     report once per entry and add no information — same text, same reason.
 *   - one entry, evaluated many times -> both dedupe. This site is re-entered
 *     more than a node gate is: `hasVisibleNavigationItems` re-runs every item
 *     predicate to DERIVE area visibility (objectui#3311) before
 *     `NavigationRenderer` runs them again to render, and both re-run on every
 *     sidebar re-render.
 *
 * A per-item key is therefore never better and sometimes much worse. It is also
 * unreachable without widening `VisibilityEvaluator` (@object-ui/layout), whose
 * whole signature is `(expression) => boolean` — a cross-package public type
 * change this diagnostics-only card does not get to make. The predicate SOURCE
 * is the locator instead, and it is in both the key and the printed line: it is
 * the string an author greps their metadata for, and it is unique to the bug in
 * a way an item id is not.
 *
 * ## Why this spelling
 *
 * Namespaced with a colon, like `page:tabs` (the other non-node surface wired to
 * this reporter). It names the app-shell `visible` GATE, not a component key —
 * `app-shell` is deliberately NOT a registry key (objectui#4841), and the colon
 * keeps this label out of that bare namespace so a diagnostic can never be read
 * as claiming one.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT `nav:item`, even though this card is written about nav
 * and area items: `evaluateVisibility` is also the gate `RecordFormPage` runs
 * over an object's field visibility predicates, and labelling those "nav" would
 * be false.
 *
 * The stated consequence — a nav item and a form field carrying the IDENTICAL
 * broken predicate text sharing one dedupe entry — no longer arises, and the
 * reason is worth keeping rather than deleting. Since objectui#6514 the two
 * sites report under DIFFERENT authored keys (`visible` for nav and area items,
 * `visibleWhen` for an object field), and `key` is part of the dedupe tuple, so
 * the same broken string now produces one line per surface. That is a strictly
 * better outcome than the one accepted here, and it is a side effect of naming
 * the key honestly, not a goal: the line still names the predicate SOURCE,
 * which is what both sites are grepped by.

 * object field's declared metadata keys, which is the only thing this one does;
 * one shared name across the three would blur exactly the distinction those
 * files keep.
 *
 * ## The keys, and the one that is NOT read
 *
 * Both call sites (`RecordFormPage`, and `AppContent`'s global record-form
 * modal) used to gate on `evaluateVisibility(f.visible, …)`. That key is
 * refused by `FieldSchema`, so the gate was unreachable through the authoring
 * surface — a field `visible` never survives validation, and a census over the
 * framework's 113 `*.object.*` files found zero of them. Maintainer ruling,
 * 2026-08-27 (objectui#6514, Option A): read the DECLARED keys instead and
 * DELETE the dead read. `visible` is not consulted, in either polarity.
 *
 * ## Why the two keys compose as AND
 *
 * `hidden` is the static gate; `visibleWhen` is documented as "shown only when
 * TRUE (else hidden)" — a NECESSARY condition, never a licence to un-hide a
 * statically hidden field. So a field shows only when it is not `hidden` AND
 * its predicate holds. This is the same shape `@object-ui/core`'s
 * `resolveFieldRuleState` already uses one tier down, where the static and the
 * predicate OR into the restrictive verdict (`readonly || readonlyWhen`,
 * `required || requiredWhen`).
 *
 * ## Scope: no `current_user` binding is ADDED here
 *
 * Field-level visibility keeps the contract's current scope (ruling
 * sub-clause, 2026-08-27). This helper adds no roots: it hands `visibleWhen` to
 * `evaluateVisibility` over whatever evaluator the caller already built, and
 * the fail-open on a faulting predicate is the shipped, documented behaviour of
 * this tier (objectui#6443 / #6487) — unchanged. Per-user field hiding is the
 * option/form layers' job, because those bind the user.
