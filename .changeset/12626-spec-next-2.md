Resolve `@objectstack/*` `18.0.0-next.2` (objectui#12626).

The console and the runner bundle `18.0.0-next.2`. `@object-ui/types` and `@object-ui/app-shell` now declare `@objectstack/spec` `^18.0.0-next.2`; the other packages keep `^18.0.0-next.1`, which already admits it.

**The record dialog opens bounded on desktop for every object.** A create, edit or child record dialog on an object with many fields used to open as a 95vw task canvas. `@objectstack/spec` `18.0.0-next.2` derives a bounded modal for it on desktop and keeps the full-screen sheet on a phone, and the console now takes that answer directly.

**Accept sets that narrow with it.** `@object-ui/types` validates a page through the spec's own page checks, so its faces (`safeValidateSchema` and `StrictAnyComponentSchema`) now refuse what `18.0.0-next.2` refuses. Each was accepted before:

- On a `kind: 'full'` page, a region whose `name` the page's `template` does not place (with the default template: anything but `header`, `sidebar`, `main`, `aside` and `footer`), and a second region for a slot another region already fills. The renderer stacked such a region under `main` at full width. Rename it to a slot the template places, or choose the `dashboard` template, which lays every other region out as a grid cell.
- `isDefault: true` on a page whose `type` is its page kind (`record`, `home` or `utility`) unless it is a `record` page bound to an `object`. Delete the key; an app's landing page is its first navigation item.
