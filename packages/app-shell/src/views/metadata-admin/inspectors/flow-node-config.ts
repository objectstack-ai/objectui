/**
 * flow-node-config — declarative, spec-precise config-field schema per flow
 * node type.
 *
 * Node types and the structured config blocks below mirror the authoritative
 * `@objectstack/spec` FlowNode schema (automation/flow.zod.ts): the type enum
 * is the spec's `FlowNodeAction`, and spec-schematized blocks — `waitEventConfig`
 * (wait), `connectorConfig` (connector_action), `boundaryConfig`
 * (boundary_event) and the node-level `timeoutMs` — are edited as precise form
 * fields rather than free JSON.
 *
 * Each field declares a `path` into the node object. Most CRUD/script/http
 * fields live under `['config', key]` (the spec's freeform, type-specific
 * config record); spec-structured blocks live at the node top level, e.g.
 * `['waitEventConfig', 'eventType']`. Only fields whose path is rooted at
 * `config` "own" a config key — any *other* config keys remain editable in the
 * optional Advanced block so authors are never locked out.
 *
 * Field kinds: scalar (text / expression / number / boolean / select),
 * `textarea` (script code, request body) and `keyValue` for flat object maps
 * (e.g. record field values, connector input). Deeply nested / array values
 * still fall back to the optional Advanced block.
 *
 * The field labels/help/options here are English (the source of truth). A zh-CN
 * overlay lives in `../i18n` (FLOW_FIELD_ZH) and is applied at render by
 * {@link localizeFlowFields} — which also localizes the engine-published
 * `configSchema` fields, since built-in nodes share the same field ids.

/**
 * What a `reference` field points at — the picker's data source. Most kinds

 * plain text box.
 *
 *   • `object`        → a business object, by API name (`client.list('object')`)
 *   • `object-field`  → a field of some object; the object is resolved via
 *                       {@link FlowReferenceSpec.objectSource}
 *   • `flow`          → a flow, by name (`client.list('flow')`)
 *   • `org-membership-level`
 *                     → an org-membership tier. A CLOSED enum rendered as a
 *                       STRICT select (framework #3508): there is no `role`
 *                       metadata type to list (ADR-0090 D3), and free text is
 *                       how dirty values like `sales_manager` got stored. The
 *                       vocabulary is the spec's membership-role list, taken
 *                       from the server-published `sources` entry when there
 *                       is one — never spelled out here, which is how it went
 *                       stale before (objectui#5309).
 *   • `user` / `team` / `department` / `position` → a DATA-record lookup on
 *                       the matching directory object (`sys_user` / `sys_team`
 *                       / `sys_business_unit` / `sys_position`) via the
 *                       DataSource adapter — NOT the metadata registry, which
 *                       lists no records (framework #3508). `position` commits
 *                       the machine NAME (`sys_user_position` routes by name,
 *                       ADR-0090 D3); the others commit the row id. See
 *                       `KIND_TO_RECORD_LOOKUP`, which mirrors the spec's
 *                       `APPROVER_VALUE_BINDINGS`.
 *   • `manager`       → auto-resolved at runtime (submitter's manager) — a
 *                       disabled cell, no value to author
 *   • `queue`         → declared-but-unenforced in the runtime (framework
 *                       #3508): free text + warning, not offered for new rows
 *   • `node`          → another node in *this* flow, by id (read from the draft)
 *   • `connector`     → an installed connector (`client.list('connector')`)
 *   • `email-template`→ an email template (`client.list('email_template')`)
 *
 * Kinds that have no catalog in the current tenant simply degrade to a plain
 * text box (record lookups also keep a manual-entry escape hatch) — the author
 * is never trapped.

   *    checked state from it, so the box shows the value the runtime applies
   *    rather than a blank `false`.
   * 3. Since objectui#6830 arm A's select half, a `select` control shows it as
   *    the trigger's PLACEHOLDER — the matching option's label, drawn muted —

 * {@link jsonSchemaToFlowFields} produces, since it roots every field it emits
 * at `['config', key]`. But several node types keep part (or all) of their

 * (connector_action), `waitEventConfig` (wait), `boundaryConfig`
 * (boundary_event) — or at the node top level (`timeoutMs`, four types).
 *
 * Replacing the whole group with the server's therefore deletes editors the
 * server never claimed to describe. That is not hypothetical: `connector_action`
 * shipped a `configSchema` declaring `connectorId`/`actionId`/`input` as CONFIG
 * keys, and against a live backend it replaced this table's `connectorConfig.*`
 * fields — connector and action pickers included — so an author writing a
 * connector node online filled in keys the executor never reads, and the node
 * refused to dispatch. framework#4210 retired that schema; this merge is what
 * stops the next one from doing the same to `wait` or `boundary_event`.
 *
 * So the server owns the config-rooted fields (it is the authority on what the
 * executor reads), and the hand-written non-config fields are always preserved,
 * in their declared order, after them. When no schema is published the
 * hand-written group is used whole, unchanged.
