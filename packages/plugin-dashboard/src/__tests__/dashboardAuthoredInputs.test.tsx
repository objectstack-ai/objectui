 *
 * `dashboard` — the honoured keys are published, per key, and the two ruled
 * out stay pinned out (objectui#5742).
 *
 * ## The card
 *
 * The `dashboard` registration published exactly three inputs (`columns`,
 * `gap`, `className`) while `DashboardRenderer` honoured `widgets`, `label` /
 * legacy `title`, `description`, `header`, `globalFilters`, `dateRange` and
 * `refreshIntervalSeconds` (spelled `refreshInterval` until @objectstack/spec
 * 17.4.0 renamed it — objectui#7783). `inputs` is not documentation: it is the published
 * authoring surface (`gen-manifest.ts` serializes it into
 * `sdui.manifest.json` — the save gate and parser whitelist — and into
 * `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts`, and `dashboard` is in `PUBLIC_BLOCKS`). So
 * `validateTree` warned authors off keys that work — `widgets` included, the
 * very prop whose CONTENTS the objectui#5709 `unconsumed-widget-option`
 * warning reasons about, two diagnostics reading incoherently side by side.
 *
 * ## The per-key line (the shipped #4668 / #5091 precedents)
 *
 * A key is DECLARED only when both hold: the renderer reads it AND
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s strict `DashboardSchema` accepts it — so the manifest
 * never offers a key the save gate refuses. That line puts seven keys in and
 * keeps two honest exclusions out:
 *
 *   - `title` — the legacy objectui spelling of the spec-canonical `label`
 *     (framework#1878). The spec REJECTS it by name, so declaring it would
 *     publish a key an author could not save.
 *
 *     ⚠️ SUPERSEDED IN PART (objectui#7509, maintainer ruling 2026-09-04,
 *     decision batch #29). This file used to add "and the `schema.title ||
 *     schema.label` read STAYS — documents in the wild carry it — which is
 *     exactly the #5091 shape: non-author surface, still read." That read is
 *     GONE: the five dashboard-root `title` read arms retired together under
 *     ADR-0049, and `label` is now the only header source. What is unchanged
 *     is this file's own subject — `title` stays OUT of the published `inputs`
 *     — and its reason only got stronger: the key is now neither authorable
 *     nor read. The retirement's own pins live in
 *     `DashboardRenderer.rootTitleRetired.test.tsx` and its four siblings; the
 *     block at the bottom of this file was rewritten to match, rather than
 *     deleted, because "the renderer's behaviour on the key" is a claim this
 *     file makes and must therefore keep making — correctly.
 *   - `aria` — the spec carries a TOMBSTONE for `dashboard.aria` (removed at
 *     the #3896 audit close-out, "no dashboard renderer ever applied it").
 *     Measured here too: this package has NO read site for `schema.aria`, so
 *     unlike `title` there is no "renderer still reads it" leg — the issue
 *     body's listing of `aria` among the honoured reads was wrong on that one
 *     key. The pin is that it stays unpublished and spec-refused.
 *
 * ## The third exclusion: `name` — ruled non-author, on weaker evidence
 *
 * `schema.name` is read too (it keys the `dashboards.{name}.*` translation
 * lookups), and it is NOT declared: objectui#5742 ruled it non-author for
 * the INLINE node.
 *
 * Its reason is NOT `title`'s or `aria`'s, and that difference is the point.
 * The spec ACCEPTS `name` — but on the DOCUMENT form, where it is REQUIRED,
 * not on this inline node. So the per-key line above never fires here at
 * all: its first clause ("the spec accepts it") is about a different shape.
 * Do not read this exclusion as "the spec rejects `name`" — it does not, and
 * a reader who sees `name` excluded beside `title` and assumes the same
 * reason has it wrong.
 *
 * The `schema.name` read STAYS untouched, exactly as `title`'s does — the
 * renderer still resolves `dashboards.{name}.*` through it.
 *
 * The evidence is the PRODUCER alone: `DashboardView` / the document loader
 * hands the loaded document to the renderer, so an inline author is not the
 * one who writes this key. That is a WEAKER pin than the two in `NON_AUTHOR`
 * below, each of which asserts a spec verdict a reader can re-check — and it
 * is why `name` carries no row there: there is no verdict for it to assert.
 * Its absence from `inputs` is ruled, not merely unexamined; do not read that
 * silence as the same strength of guarantee the other two carry.
 *
 * The supporting reason, had the above not already settled it: publishing
 * `name` inline would teach authors — AI authors especially — to fabricate a
 * dashboard identity that resolves NO translations and fails silently. That
 * is a newly manufactured silently-inert key: the exact defect class this
 * card removes.
 *
 * ## Why every positive has a control
 *
 * "No diagnostic" is also what a silenced check looks like: the undeclared
 * probe key must still draw `unknown-prop`, the declared control must be
 * published, and the spec must accept the full declared document — otherwise
 * every absence/rejection assertion here would pass against a registry that
 * published nothing or a schema that refuses everything (the same pairing
 * `ga-honoured-inputs-author-reach.test.ts` and `gridNonAuthorKeys.test.tsx`
 * use, for the same reason).
 *
 * Module-scope registration import, not a hook (AGENTS.md §测试纪律): the
 * registration is the fixture, and its cold transform must not be billed to a
 * bounded test/hook window.
