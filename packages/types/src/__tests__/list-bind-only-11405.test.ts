/**
 * objectui#11405 — a bind-only `list` is accepted: `ListSchema.items` is
 * optional on both published faces, and the zod face requires AT LEAST ONE of
 * `bind` / `items`.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `list.tsx` reads `useDataScope(schema.bind)` first and falls back to
 * `schema.items` when the bound value is not an array, so a `list` carrying only
 * `bind` draws one entry per element of the bound array. Both published faces
 * nevertheless REQUIRED `items`: `safeValidateSchema({ type: 'list', bind:
 * 'customerNames' })` was refused with `invalid_type` at `items`, the strict face
 * agreed, and the TypeScript face refused the same literal (`TS2741`). Four
 * marked fences in two published guides author exactly that shape, and their
 * marker only checks that they parse, so nothing noticed.
 *
 * Triage's ruling (comment 5941529511): the arm follows the renderer, and the
 * guides are not edited. The rule is at least one and ⛔ not exactly one,
 * because `items` is the renderer's real fallback beside `bind`.
 *
 * ## What this file pins
 *
 * - the zod face, through the arm itself, through `safeValidateSchema` (the
 *   function `objectui validate` calls) and through the strict face: a bind-only
 *   `list`, an items-only one and one carrying both are accepted, and one with
 *   neither is refused ONCE, at the node, keyed `LIST_ENTRIES_REQUIRED`;
 * - the TypeScript face: the bind-only literal compiles. That half is judged by
 *   `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` (`pnpm --filter @object-ui/types type-check`),
 *   not by vitest, which strips types. The TypeScript face cannot spell "at
 *   least one" with an optional member, so a literal with neither key still
 *   compiles; the rule lives on the mirror, as it does for `object-kanban`
 *   (objectui#7780);
 * - the guides: every marked fence that authors a bind-only `list` is READ OFF
 *   DISK with `scanSkillFences`, the reader the marker's own gate uses, and fed
 *   to `safeValidateSchema`. A copy here would not notice a guide change. A fence
 *   the guide itself marks ❌ is wrong for another reason (its `children` and
 *   its `${item.name}`), so for it this file pins only that `items` is no longer
 *   what refuses it.
