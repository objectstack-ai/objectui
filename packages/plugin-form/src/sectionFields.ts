/**
 * Shared section-field normalizer for the sectioned form variants
 * (Tabbed / Wizard / Split / Drawer / Modal).
 *
 * A form-view section lists its fields in one of three shapes:
 *
 *   1. a plain string — the field name:                 `'account_number'`
 *   2. a spec FormFieldSchema object (canonical) —      `{ field: 'name', required: true, colSpan: 2 }`
 *   3. an already-built runtime FormField object —       `{ name: 'x', type: 'text', ... }`
 *
 * Shape (2) is what `@objectstack/spec` emits — see FormFieldSchema, where the
 * key is `field`, NOT `name`. The variants used to read `fieldDef.name` and push
 * the raw object straight through, so a spec entry reached react-hook-form with
 * `name === undefined` and crashed the whole form on `name.split('.')`. This
 * helper normalizes all three shapes into a runtime FormField with a real
 * `name`, merging object-schema metadata (type/options/validation) with the
 * spec-level overrides.
 *
 * Also hosts `warnUnresolvedTopLevelField` (objectui#8738 route 1) — the
 * top-level `fields` counterpart of this file's own `warnOnMixedVocabulary`,
 * shared by `ObjectForm.tsx`'s `SimpleObjectForm` and `flatFields.ts`'s
 * `buildFlatFields`, neither of which is a sectioned variant. It lives here
 * rather than in a third module because the vocabulary it warns about IS the
 * one shape (2) documents, and the two warnings should not drift in voice.
