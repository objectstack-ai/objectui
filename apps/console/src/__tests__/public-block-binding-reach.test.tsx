 * Public blocks — a declared `objectName` binding must REACH THE DATA LAYER
 * (objectstack#4472, the detection half of objectstack#4413).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The framework's spec↔registry check (`check:react-declaration-parity`)
 * compares two DECLARATIONS: the spec zod schema's props on one side, and on
 * the other the `inputs` this repo's registry configs declare — copied verbatim
 * into `sdui.manifest.json` by `manifestFromConfigs`. Neither side observes a
 * renderer. So a prop that both sides declare and NO renderer consumes reads as
 * perfect agreement over there, and it did: `record:details` /
 * `record:highlights` / `record:related_list` / `record:path` published
 * `objectName`+`recordId` that nothing read, four blocks rendered blank, and
 * that check stayed green for the whole life of the defect (objectstack#4413).
 * It was found by a human reading these renderers.
 *
 * This test is the evidence that check cannot gather, taken from the only place
 * that has it — the render path. It is deliberately narrow: not "is every
 * declared input consumed" (undecidable from outside without heuristics) but
 * one exact, observable question per block —
 *
 *   mount it through `SchemaRenderer` with a plausible value for every input it
 *   declares, under a provider whose `dataSource` records every call:
 *   **did any call carry the object name?**
 *
 * Every declared input, not just the required ones: a block's read path can be
 * gated on an optional one (`embeddable-form` only builds the read-only source
 * its inner `ObjectForm` fetches through when `config.fields` is non-empty), and
 * omitting it would read here as "does not bind" when the truth is "was never
 * asked to". Values are plausible rather than degenerate for the same reason —
 * an early `[]` for `columns` makes a list render its empty state without ever
 * asking for data.
 *
 * That distinction — a plausible value for EVERY input is not the same as a
 * plausible CONFIGURATION — is the lesson this file keeps re-learning, and it is
 * recorded instance by instance rather than as a slogan: five in
 * {@link SUPERSEDES_BINDING}, the sixth and seventh in {@link sampleFor}. Seven
 * is the count because every one of them cost a red or, worse, a green for the
 * wrong reason. Read them before adding a sample.
 *
 * A block that declares `objectName` and asks the data layer for something else
 * — or for nothing at all — is not bound to the object it advertises. That is
 * the objectstack#4413 shape, stated behaviourally.
 *
 * ## Scope, stated so it is not over-read in turn
 *
 * A reaching call proves the binding is WIRED, not that the block renders
 * correctly. And "did not reach" has legitimate causes (a block that needs a
 * parent record id first), which is what the ledger below is for — every
 * non-reaching block carries a written reason, and the ledger is asserted to
 * equal the observed set in BOTH directions, so a block that starts reaching
 * must be removed from it and a block that stops reaching fails here.
 *
 * The other half of "not over-read" is COVERAGE, and it has to be asserted
 * rather than assumed — see {@link EXPECTED_CANDIDATES}. This suite's first
 * release under-reported its own scope by 6 of 14 object-bound blocks and said
 * nothing (objectui#3149), which is the same shape as the gate it was written to
 * compensate for: a claim wider than the thing behind it.

/**
 * Inputs that SUPERSEDE the `objectName` binding — filling them is the author
 * telling the block not to fetch, so the probe must leave them unset.
 *
 * Narrow and reasoned, not a convenience escape hatch. `data` is the documented
 * alternative data source: @objectstack/spec's react overlay glosses it as
 * *"static/precomputed data to chart directly **instead of** binding via
 * objectName + aggregate"*, and `ObjectChart`'s fetch is guarded by
 * `if ((schema.objectName || schema.dataset) && !boundData && !schema.data)`.
 * Filling it and then reporting "objectName never reached the data layer" would
 * be the probe manufacturing its own finding — the same mistake as seeding
 * `columns: []` (which makes a list render its empty state without fetching) or
 * spreading a bare Proxy (which strips a derived source of every method). Three
 * instances of one lesson: a plausible value for EVERY input is not the same as
 * a plausible CONFIGURATION.
 *
 * `customFields` is the second, and it arrived the same way `data` did — as a
 * red on this probe the moment objectui#4648 declared `object-form`'s full
 * authoring surface. Its guard is `ObjectForm.tsx:426`,
 * `const hasInlineFields = schema.customFields && schema.customFields.length > 0`,
 * read at `:455` under the comment *"Skip fetching if we have inline fields"* —
 * which substitutes a minimal in-memory object schema for the
 * `getObjectSchema(schema.objectName)` call — and again at `:479` to skip the
 * record fetch. The repo's own type says the same in prose: *"When used with
 * inline field definitions (without dataSource), this becomes the primary field
 * source"* (`ObjectFormSchema.customFields`, `packages/types/src/objectql.ts`).
 * So a non-empty `customFields` is the author declaring the fields inline, i.e.
 * telling the block not to fetch — the `data` case exactly. Note the guard is
 * LENGTH-sensitive: `sampleFor` returns a non-empty `['name']` for an array
 * input, which is what tripped it; an empty array would have left the binding
 * intact. That is the "plausible value ≠ plausible configuration" lesson a
 * fourth time.
 *
 * `staticData` is the third entry, and it arrived exactly as the other two did —
 * as a red on this probe the moment objectui#8314 declared `object-calendar`'s
 * full authoring surface. It is RUNG 2 of the shared record-source ladder, one
 * below `data` and one ABOVE `objectName`
 * (`packages/core/src/utils/record-source.ts`):
 *
 *     if (schema.staticData) {
 *       return { provider: 'value', items: schema.staticData };
 *     }
 *
 *     if (schema.objectName) {
 *       return { provider: 'object', object: schema.objectName };
 *     }
 *
 * The published contract says the same from both faces — `ObjectMapSchema
 * .objectName` / `ObjectGanttSchema.objectName` gloss it as *"the THIRD record
 * source `getDataConfig` resolves, after `data` and `staticData`"* — and the
 * consuming renderers act on it: `ObjectCalendar.tsx` takes its
 * `hasInlineData && dataProvider === 'value'` branch, calls `setData(dataItems)`
 * and never reaches `dataSource.find`. So filling `staticData` is the author
 * telling the block not to fetch, and reporting "objectName never reached the
 * data layer" from it would be the probe manufacturing its own finding, exactly
 * as it would for `data`. Length-sensitive like `customFields`: `sampleFor`
 * returns a non-empty `['name']` for an array input, and an empty one would have
 * left the binding intact. That is the "plausible value ≠ plausible
 * configuration" lesson a fifth time.
 *
 * ⚠️ Worth knowing for the next declaration that lands on a ladder block: the
 * five blocks sharing this ladder (calendar, gantt, grid, map, tree) all read
 * `staticData`, so any of them declaring it belongs here on the same reasoning,
 * and this entry covers them without a further edit.
 *
 * Add to this list only with the guard quoted, so the next reader can check the
 * claim instead of trusting it.

/**
 * A plausible value for one declared input.
 *
 * "Plausible", not "present": arrays are non-empty because an empty `columns` is
 * a config a block can legitimately short-circuit on, and a block that renders
 * its empty state without asking for data would read here as an unbound
 * binding.
 *
 * `sections` is the SIXTH instance of the lesson counted in
 * {@link SUPERSEDES_BINDING}, and the one objectui#3840 was filed for. The
 * generic `array` sample is `['name']`, and a bare string is not a section:
 * `@objectstack/spec`'s `FormViewSchema.sections` rejects it at parse —
 * `safeParse(['name'])` returns *"Invalid input: expected object, received
 * string"* — and requires every entry to declare its members (`[{}]` returns
 * *"0.fields: A section must declare its members exactly one way, and this form
 * section declares neither"*). So `['name']` is not metadata any author could
 * publish, while `ObjectForm.tsx`'s section loop read `section.fields.map(...)`
 * off each entry unguarded and took the whole block down with *"Cannot read
 * properties of undefined (reading 'map')"*. That makes the error card a
 * FIXTURE defect, not the product bug the shape suggested — the discriminator
 * being the spec shape, not the fact that a different sample stops the crash
 * (which is true either way).
 *
 * ⚠️ Two halves of that reasoning moved with objectui#7051 and are restated
 * here rather than left to read as still-true. (1) `ObjectFormSection.fields`
 * is no longer REQUIRED on this repo's type: `group` — the field-group
 * REFERENCE form, `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 / objectstack#13855 — is the other
 * way a section declares the same fact, so the spec refuses an entry carrying
 * NEITHER rather than one missing `fields`. The fixture reasoning is unchanged
 * (a bare string is still not a section, and `{}` is still refused), only its
 * quoted grounds. (2) That unguarded `.map` is now spelled `?? []`, so this
 * sample's shape no longer decides whether the block survives — which is
 * exactly why the sample is justified on the SPEC shape and not on the crash.
 *
 * `formType` is the SEVENTH, and it is why `object-master-detail-form` read GREEN
 * while carrying the identical latent crash. That block declares `formType` as a
 * bare `string` — not the enum `object-form` declares — so the default branch
 * below handed it `'x'`, a value the form family has no path for. The crashing
 * section loop is gated on `(!schema.formType || schema.formType === 'simple')`
 * (`ObjectForm.tsx:1134`), so `'x'` skipped straight past it. Measured, with
 * `sections` still malformed: forcing `formType: 'simple'` reproduces the same
 * `reading 'map'` crash on that block. A sample outside a prop's own vocabulary
 * does not exercise the block, it routes AROUND it — here around a real defect,
 * for as long as nobody looked. Both samples below are spec-valid on their own
 * merit, not as crash avoidance.
