 *   - Broken imports or missing modules in the production bundle
 *   - Missing polyfills (e.g. `process`, `crypto`)
 *   - Uncaught JavaScript exceptions during bootstrap
 *   - Failed network requests for critical assets (JS/CSS bundles)
 *   - React failing to mount into #root

  /**
   * The app must settle into one of its RECOGNISED boot destinations. Which one
   * it reaches depends on the session, and in this suite — a production bundle
   * served by `vite preview` with no backend behind it — that is always the
   * signed-out sign-in screen: `/api/v1/auth/get-session` cannot resolve to a
   * session, so the shell is never entitled to render a `nav` and the router
   * lands on `/login`.
   *
   * Until objectui#4086 this test listed only the first two destinations, and
   * the boot splash it named is on screen for roughly 35 ms — measured against
   * this same production bundle at 30 ms polling granularity: blank until
   * ~70 ms, the "Initializing application…" splash from ~70 ms, replaced by the
   * sign-in screen from ~105 ms and never returning. So the assertion could
   * only ever pass by catching that window. On a runner where Playwright's
   * first poll landed after it, the expectation was ALREADY unsatisfiable and
   * burned the full 30 s timeout — identically on all three retries, because
   * each retry re-runs the same race. That is the whole of the `Build & E2E`
   * red on `main` at 9154d9e90, which no code change could explain and which
   * cleared on its own at 8497579db with the suspected commit still in place.
   *
   * The set below stays CLOSED on purpose: a blank page, a crashed render or an
   * error boundary matches none of these three and still fails the test. What
   * changes is that every state the app is legitimately allowed to be in is now
   * terminal-stable, including the sign-in screen's final state with no backend:
   * the "Cannot connect to server" panel that replaces the form once the
   * auth-config read fails (objectui#11806), so passing no longer depends on
   * winning a race.
