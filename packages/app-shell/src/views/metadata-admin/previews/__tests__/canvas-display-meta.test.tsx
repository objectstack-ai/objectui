/**
 * objectui#5837 — the page canvas draws chrome for what a page CAN CONTAIN,
 * not for what the palette OFFERS.
 *
 * `BLOCK_TYPE_META` is the palette's offer list ("what may an author drag in").
 * `PageBlockCanvas` was reading it to pick a node's icon and colour tone, which
 * is a different question ("what may an author already have in this page").
 * The two coincide for every palette exclusion whose reason is that the block
 * is not page content at all — and diverge for an alias pair, where one renderer
 * has two spellings and the palette deliberately advertises only one of them.
 * The unadvertised spelling renders perfectly and got the unknown-block box.
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and how it avoids two easy ways of being wrong
 *
 * 1. RENDERABILITY, NOT EXCLUSION. `BLOCK_RENDERER_ALIAS_GROUPS` is only
 *    allowed to list spellings that the runtime registry resolves to the very
 *    same component. That is asserted here against the real `ComponentRegistry`
 *    (identity, not "both defined"), so the declaration cannot quietly grant
 *    friendly chrome to a type that has no renderer behind it. The counter-probe
 *    is `element:text_input`: excluded for an unrelated reason, no twin, and it
 *    must keep the generic box.
 *
 * 2. NO ORIENTATION IS HARD-CODED. Which member of the pair the palette
 *    advertises is a maintainer decision that already flipped once (#5495 moved
 *    it from the legacy alias to the canonical name). Every assertion below
 *    DERIVES the offered/unoffered split from `BLOCK_TYPE_META` instead of
 *    naming a side, and one test flips the catalogue outright to prove the
 *    resolver follows.
 *
 * The offer list itself must not move: "the icon appears" is also satisfiable by
 * quietly making the type draggable, which is exactly the invariant #2943 built
 * `PALETTE_EXCLUSIONS` to protect. That is the third block of tests.
