 * objectui#9718 — THE WRITING END of the page-kind to node-type channel.
 *
 * ## What was unguarded, and how that was measured
 *
 * objectui#9642 declared the channel and pinned it with
 * `page-kind-node-type-channel-9642`, which lives in `@object-ui/components`.
 * A comment at the writing end — the `type: (page as any).type || 'page'`
 * mapping in `PageView` — told the next editor that changing the mapping would
 * turn that pin red "by design". It would not, and the reason is structural:
 * `@object-ui/components` does not depend on `@object-ui/app-shell`, so that
 * pin's module graph cannot reach `PageView` at all.
 *
 * Both directions were measured on objectui#9718 before this file was written:
 *
 * - gutting the mapping to a constant `type: 'page'` left
 *   `page-kind-node-type-channel-9642` GREEN, every case passing;
 * - deleting the `utility` registration — the READING end — turned that same
 *   pin RED, with the failure naming the kind.
 *
 * ⇒ the objectui#9642 pin genuinely guards the READING end. It never guarded
 * the writing end, and this file is the surface that does.
 *
 * ## Why this file lives in `@object-ui/app-shell`
 *
 * The writing end IS an app-shell file, and app-shell already depends on
 * `@object-ui/components` and `@object-ui/core` — so a pin here reaches both
 * ends of the channel with no new dependency edge. ⛔ The mirror-image route
 * (giving `@object-ui/components` an app-shell dependency so the objectui#9642
 * pin could import `PageView`) closes a cycle and was ruled out on objectui#9718.
 *
 * ## What this file asserts, and what it deliberately leaves alone
 *
 * It asserts the WRITE: which node type `PageView` hands to `SchemaRenderer`
 * for a stored page document of each kind. ⛔ It does not re-assert the reading
 * end's split (which kinds resolve to `PageRenderer`) — that is
 * `page-kind-node-type-channel-9642`'s job and it is not weakened here. ⛔ It
 * changes no render path and adds, removes or renames no registration.
