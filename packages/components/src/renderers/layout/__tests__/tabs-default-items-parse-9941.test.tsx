/**
 * The shipped `ui:tabs` registration's `defaultProps.items` satisfy the
 * published `TabItemSchema` (objectui#9941).
 *
 * ## The defect this pin was built around
 *
 * `TabItemSchema` (`packages/types/src/zod/layout.zod.ts`, cited by SYMBOL —
 * objectui#8875) declares `content` with **no** `.optional()` — required — and
 * declares **no `body` member at all**. The registration seeded three items
 * that spelled `body` and omitted `content`, so the default an author drops on
 * a canvas was refused by the validator this repository publishes for it:
 *
 *     invalid_type ["content"] expected nonoptional, received undefined
 *
 * ⚠️ The defect was never visible in the rendered UI. At the time, `tabs.tsx`
 * read `content` first and fell back to `body` through an `any` cast, so the
 * seeded nodes drew from the fallback arm. It was the DECLARED contract that
 * refused them, and only a parse can see that. objectui#9590 has since retired
 * that fallback: `tabs.tsx` draws `item.content` and nothing else, pinned by
 * `tabs-item-body-retired-9590.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## Why this pin parses instead of reading the spelling
 *
 * A test asserting the three items spell `content` is satisfied forever by a
 * copy-paste of the literal; it re-states the fix instead of checking it. This
 * one feeds whatever the registry actually carries through the published schema,
 * so it fails the day anyone re-spells a member, adds a fourth item that omits
 * `content`, or moves the seed — and it fails for the same reason the card was
 * filed, not for a reason a reader has to reconstruct.
 *
 * Both faces are read off live artifacts: the seed off `ComponentRegistry` (the
 * object a designer palette consumes), the contract off `@object-ui/types/zod`
 * (the object a validator consumes). Nothing below is a copy of either.
 *
 * ## Which rows discriminate, and which are controls
 *
 * ⚠️ The `controlB` rows are green in BOTH worlds BY DESIGN — that is the whole
 * claim of this card. The repair is at the parse, so a row that moved with it
 * would be evidence the repair was visual after all. The rows that discriminate
 * are the three subject rows; `controlA` and `controlB` exist to prove the
 * instrument can fail and that the UI did not follow, respectively.
 *
 * ## The instrument's two failure modes, each with its own control
 *
 * 1. **A parse over nothing is green.** An empty (or missing) `items` array
 *    makes `every item parses` vacuously true, so the seed's presence and
 *    non-emptiness are asserted first, as their own rows.
 * 2. **A parse that cannot refuse anything is green.** `controlA` feeds the
 *    pre-fix item — the same objects with `content` re-spelled back to `body` —
 *    to the same call and requires a refusal that names `content`. If that row
 *    goes green the subject rows below measure nothing.
 *
 * ## ⛔ What this pin deliberately does NOT claim
 *
 * - ⛔ It does not assert that `body` is refused. `TabItemSchema` is a stripping
 *   `z.object`, so an undeclared `body` is silently DROPPED, not rejected;
 *   `undeclaredBodyIsDropped` records that as the measured behaviour rather
 *   than letting a later reader assume a strict face.
 * - ⛔ It does not decide the `body` fallback in `tabs.tsx`; objectui#9590
 *   retired it, and `tabs-item-body-retired-9590.test.tsx` is that change's pin.
 *   A `controlB.equality` row used to READ the fallback arm, to prove this
 *   repair was parse-level and not visual: the pre-fix spelling painted the
 *   same thing as the fixed one. It retired WITH the arm, as it said it would;
 *   the durable half of control B (`controlB.stillRenders`) never depended on
 *   the arm, and ⛔ no subject row moved.
 * - ⛔ It is not widened past `ui:tabs`. Whether a registration's `defaultProps`
 *   may diverge from its published face across the repository is the open
 *   question on objectui#4631 (`pm:on-hold`), and deciding it by gate rather
 *   than by ruling is the trap the sibling pin in this directory
 *   (`registration-defaults-match-renderer-8229.test.ts`) documents at length.
