title: "Dashboard-Level Filters"
---

A dashboard often needs one top-level filter — a date range, a region select —
that drives **several charts at once**. ObjectUI models this as a
**dashboard-level parameter**, not a shared dataset:

- The **filter control and its value live on the dashboard** — hosted as
  dashboard-level variables (the page/dashboard variables primitive).
- Each widget declares which of **its own** fields a filter binds to via
  `filterBindings` — a small mapping, not a copied query.
- At render time the dashboard **broadcasts** the active values into every
  bound widget's inline query, `AND`-combined with the widget's own `filter`.

Charts stay inline and self-contained; one place owns the filter; each chart
edit stays local.

## Tutorial: from zero to a filtered dashboard

### Step 1 — a plain dashboard

Start from two charts over **different** datasets. Without filters they always
show everything:

```json
{
  "type": "dashboard",
  "columns": 2,
  "widgets": [
    {
      "id": "invoices_by_status",
      "title": "Invoices by Status",
      "type": "bar",
      "dataset": "invoices",
      "dimensions": ["status"],
      "values": ["count"]
    },
    {
      "id": "accounts_signed",
      "title": "Accounts Signed",
      "type": "line",
      "dataset": "accounts",
      "dimensions": ["signed_month"],
      "values": ["count"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Where a widget's data comes from

Filters scope a widget's **query**, so which data surface a widget uses decides
whether it can respond at all:

| Surface | Shape | Filtered? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Semantic-layer dataset (ADR-0021) | `"dataset": "invoices"` + `dimensions` + `values` | yes — merged into the dataset query as `runtimeFilter` |
| Inline object query | `"options": { "data": { "provider": "object", "object": "invoices", "aggregate": { "function": "count", "groupBy": "status" } } }` | yes — `AND`-merged into that query |
| Inline static data | `"options": { "data": [ … ], "xField": "status", "yField": "count" }` | no — there is no query to scope |

> **Retired: the top-level inline analytics shape.** `object` +
> `categoryField` / `valueField` / `aggregate` on the widget itself (and the
> pivot `rowField` / `columnField` pair) was **removed** — the renderer no
> longer reads those keys, and a stored widget still carrying them renders a
> visible *"This widget uses a retired data format. Edit it to bind a dataset."*
> prompt instead of a chart. Rebind such a widget to a `dataset` (select its
> `dimensions` and `values` by name), or — for a renderer-internal query with
> no semantic layer behind it — move the query under
> `options.data` with `"provider": "object"`. `@objectstack/spec` refuses the
> retired shape at publish, so this is not a soft deprecation.

### Step 2 — add the built-in date range

Declare `dateRange` at the dashboard level. A preset/custom date-range control
appears in the filter bar above the widgets:

```json
{
  "dateRange": {
    "field": "created_at",
    "defaultRange": "last_30_days",
    "allowCustomRange": true
  }
}
```

- `field` — the **default** field the range applies to on every bound widget
  (falls back to `created_at` when omitted).
- `defaultRange` — the initially selected preset: `today`, `yesterday`,
  `this_week`, `last_week`, `this_month`, `last_month`, `this_quarter`,
  `last_quarter`, `this_year`, `last_year`, `last_7_days`, `last_30_days`,
  `last_90_days`, or `custom` (starts empty and lets the user pick). When
  omitted, the default `@objectstack/spec` declares for this key applies
  (`this_month`), so a bare `dateRange: { "field": "created_at" }` opens
  filtered to the current month, not unfiltered.
- `allowCustomRange` — offer a "Custom…" item that opens a from/to calendar
  (default `true`).

`dateRange` is the `@objectstack/spec` `DashboardSchema.dateRange` shape, taken
by reference on both the validator and the TypeScript type: a preset name
outside the list above, or any other key inside the object (`preset`, `range`,
`dateField`, …), is refused at validation rather than silently ignored.

Presets stay **symbolic** until query time: they compile to date-macro tokens
(`{30_days_ago}`, `{current_month_start}`, …) that each widget resolves
exactly like hand-authored widget filters — so a dashboard saved today still
means "last 30 days" tomorrow.

### Step 3 — add a global filter

Add a `globalFilters` entry. Each entry renders one control in the filter bar:

```json
{
  "globalFilters": [
    {
      "name": "region",
      "field": "region",
      "label": "Region",
      "type": "select",
      "options": [
        { "value": "EMEA", "label": "EMEA" },
        { "value": "APAC", "label": "APAC" },
        { "value": "AMER", "label": "AMER" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `name` — the **stable filter name**: the variable key the value is published
  under, and the key widgets reference in `filterBindings`. Defaults to
  `field`. (`"dateRange"` is reserved for the built-in date range.)
- `field` — the default field the filter applies to on bound widgets.
- `object` — optional: the object `field` lives on. Declaring it opts the
  filter into that object's translations: its field label and option labels
  resolve through the same `fields.<object>.<field>` translation-bundle
  convention lists and forms use, with `label` as the fallback (see
  [i18n](#i18n)). Not the same key as `optionsFrom.object` below, which names
  the object dynamic options are fetched from.
- `type` — the control type: `text`, `number`, `select`, `lookup`, or `date`.

| Type | Control | Generated condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | input | `{ field: { "$contains": value } }` |
| `number` | numeric input | `{ field: value }` (equality) |
| `select` / `lookup` | dropdown | `{ field: value }` (or `$in` for arrays) |
| `date` | preset/custom range | `{ field: { "$gte": from, "$lte": to } }` |

A `date` filter's `defaultValue` is a **string**, and exactly three spellings
are accepted:

- a **preset name** from the `defaultRange` list above (`"last_7_days"`) — it
  is lifted to that preset's range, the same as picking it in the control;
- an **ISO date** (`"2026-01-15"`) — equality on that day;
- a **date-macro token** (`"{today}"`, `"{7_days_ago}"`) — resolved at query
  time like any other filter token.

Anything else — a misspelled preset such as `"last_7_dayz"` — is **skipped**,
and the runtime logs a `console.warn` naming the filter and the value. It is
deliberately not compared as-is: `field = "last_7_dayz"` matches no row, and
the widget would render a perfectly healthy-looking `0`.

Static `options` are `@objectstack/spec` object pairs —
`{ "value": "amer", "label": "AMER" }`. This is the only form the platform
accepts: a dashboard is validated against `GlobalFilterSchema` when it is
published, and anything else is refused there.

> **Deprecated: the bare-string shorthand.** `"options": ["EMEA", "APAC"]` is
> still lifted by the runtime to `{ "value": "EMEA", "label": "EMEA" }` pairs so
> that already-stored dashboards keep rendering, but it now logs a deprecation
> warning naming the filter, and it is scheduled for removal
> ([objectui#4356](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectui/issues/4356)).
> Write the object form. The lift is mechanically lossless, so migrating a
> stored dashboard is a direct rewrite of each string `X` to
> `{ "value": "X", "label": "X" }`.

Options can also be fetched from an object at runtime:

```json
{
  "name": "industry",
  "field": "industry",
  "label": "Industry",
  "type": "select",
  "optionsFrom": {
    "object": "accounts",
    "valueField": "industry",
    "labelField": "industry"
  }
}
```

With a dataset-capable data source, `optionsFrom` resolves distinct values
**server-side** (a GROUP BY over the source object), so the option list is
complete regardless of row count. Data sources without dataset queries fall
back to a best-effort client-side dedupe over the first 200 records.

### Step 4 — bind each widget's own fields

By default every filter applies to its own `field` on every widget. When a
widget stores the concept under a different field — or should ignore a filter
— declare `filterBindings` on the widget:

```json
{
  "widgets": [
    {
      "id": "invoices_by_status",
      "type": "bar",
      "dataset": "invoices",
      "dimensions": ["status"],
      "values": ["count"]
    },
    {
      "id": "accounts_signed",
      "type": "line",
      "dataset": "accounts",
      "dimensions": ["signed_month"],
      "values": ["count"],
      "filterBindings": { "dateRange": "signed_at", "region": "sales_region" }
    },
    {
      "id": "total_invoices",
      "title": "Total Invoices (all regions)",
      "type": "metric",
      "dataset": "invoices",
      "values": ["count"],
      "filterBindings": { "region": false }
    }
  ]
}
```

Binding rules, in precedence order:

1. `filterBindings[name]` as a **string** — apply the filter to that field.
2. `filterBindings[name]: false` — opt this widget out of that filter.
3. Legacy `targetWidgets` on the filter — when set, only listed widget ids get
   the default binding (an explicit `filterBindings` entry still wins).
4. Otherwise the filter applies to its own `field` (the built-in date range
   defaults to `dateRange.field ?? 'created_at'`).

That's the whole feature: changing any filter live re-scopes every bound
widget, each against **its own** field. Here it is running in the showcase
app's *Revenue Pulse* dashboard — the date range's default field is the
invoice `issued_on`, account widgets re-map it to `signed_on`, and the
"Accounts (all time)" KPI opts out of both filters:

![Revenue Pulse — dashboard-level date + region filters over two objects](/img/guide/dashboard-filters/revenue-pulse.png)

Selecting **EMEA** re-scopes every bound widget live (invoices via their own
`region`, accounts via `sales_region`), while the opted-out KPI holds steady —
and a Reset button appears once any filter deviates from its default:

![Revenue Pulse re-scoped to EMEA — bound widgets update, the opted-out KPI holds](/img/guide/dashboard-filters/revenue-pulse-emea.png)

Bindings can also be edited visually: the Studio dashboard widget inspector
shows a **Dashboard filter bindings** section (one row per declared filter)
with an Apply toggle (opt-out) and a field picker for the override — no JSON
editing required.

## Reading filter values in expressions

Filter values are hosted as dashboard variables, so any widget expression can
read them under the `page.` scope, keyed by the filter's `name`:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "content": "Region: ${page.region || 'All'}"
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "emea_playbook",
  "component": {
    "type": "card",
    "title": "EMEA Playbook",
    "hidden": "${page.region !== 'EMEA'}"
  }
}
```

The built-in date range is an object under `page.dateRange` — a preset selection
is `{ "preset": "last_30_days" }`, a custom range is
`{ "from": "2026-01-01", "to": "2026-03-31" }` (either bound may be absent).

## Dataset widgets

Widgets bound to a semantic-layer `dataset` participate the same way: the
dashboard merges the scoped filter into the widget's `filter`, which the
dataset widget forwards to the dataset query as `runtimeFilter`. Dataset-bound
and inline widgets mix freely on one filtered dashboard — the
`plugin-dashboard/filtered-dashboard-dataset-widgets` catalog entry is exactly
that, two dataset-bound widgets beside an inline one. What differs is only what
each surface can answer: an inline **object query**
(`options.data` with `"provider": "object"`) is scoped like a dataset widget,
while an inline **static array** carries no query and is left untouched.

## Nested variable scopes

When a filtered dashboard is embedded inside a Page that declares its own
`variables`, the two scopes **merge**: inside the dashboard subtree, `page.*`
resolves the outer Page's variables plus the dashboard's filter values, and a
dashboard filter only shadows an outer variable that has the **same name**.
Writes route to the scope that defines the variable — setting an outer-page
variable from inside the dashboard updates the outer scope, so both subtrees
stay in sync.

## Known limitations

- **Static-data widgets are not filtered** — a widget whose `options.data` is
  an inline array has no query to scope, so dashboard filters do not apply to
  it. Bind the widget to a `dataset` (or give it an `options.data` object
  query) if it should respond to filters.
- **A binding is applied as written** — the dashboard does not know a
  dataset's fields, so it cannot check a binding target for you. A default
  binding whose field the widget's data does not have produces an empty
  widget rather than a silent no-op, which is the visible, fixable failure:
  map the filter explicitly with `filterBindings: { "<name>": "<field>" }`, or
  opt out with `false`. (`buildWidgetScopedFilter` can skip an unknown default
  field with a console warning when a host passes it the widget's known field
  names; the dashboard renderer does not.)

## i18n

The filter bar's strings resolve from the `dashboard.filters.*` keys
(`@object-ui/i18n` ships `en` and `zh` entries). A control's label comes from
its filter's `label`, so translate that in your schema metadata — unless the
filter declares `object`. Then the app's translation bundle wins: the field
label resolves from the `fields.<object>.<field>` entry and each option label
from `fieldOptions.<object>.<field>.<value>`, the same convention lists and
forms use, and the authored `label` (the option's own `label`, for an option)
is only the fallback when the bundle has no entry.

## Spec alignment

`DashboardSchema.dateRange`, `GlobalFilterSchema` (including `name`) and
`DashboardWidgetSchema.filterBindings` are part of `@objectstack/spec`
(framework#2501). Author dashboards against the spec shapes; ObjectUI renders
them.
