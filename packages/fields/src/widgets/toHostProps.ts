/**
 * The RUNTIME EXECUTOR of the NON-DOM half of {@link FieldWidgetComponentProps}
 * (objectui#7008) — the sibling of `toDomProps`, and deliberately a SEPARATE
 * function rather than more entries in that whitelist.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * objectui#6909 / #7009 closed the DOM half at `FieldEditWidget`: the factory
 * hands the widget `toDomProps(props)`, so `id` / `name` / `tabIndex` /
 * `aria-*` / `data-*` and friends finally arrive. The contract also declares a
 * "Host plumbing" block plus two controlled-input keys the factory neither owns
 * nor routes to the DOM, and NOTHING carried those. A host could pass any of
 * them with no type error and the widget never received it — this package's own
 * first-class defect class, named in `toDomProps.ts`: "a key that type-checks,
 * reads as supported, and silently never reaches the element" (objectui#3290's
 * `aria-required`, objectui#3222's validation slot).
 *
 * Measured on `main` at `71d83a6b1`, the live victim was `error`:
 * `InlineFieldInput` (`@object-ui/plugin-detail`, since PR #7109) already
 * passes `error={error}` to `FieldEditWidget`, and the factory dropped it on
 * the floor — so a control that had failed validation never reported
 * `aria-invalid` and a screen-reader user was never told. The kanban
 * `RequiredFieldsDialog` had the same hole from the other side: it computes the
 * validation state, renders it in red text, and had no way to hand it over.
 *
 * ## Why NOT more keys in `DOM_PASS_THROUGH_KEYS`
 *
 * Because none of them is DOM-legal. That whitelist is deliberately closed and
 * exists precisely to stop renderer plumbing reaching an element — its own
 * header names `error`, `emptyHint`, `dataSource`, `dependentValues` and
 * `dependsOn` as examples of what a blacklist would have failed to catch. Put
 * them there and a `dataSource` adapter becomes `dataSource="[object Object]"`
 * on an `<input>`. They travel as COMPONENT props, which is what they are.
 *
 * ## Declared = enforced, in both directions
 *
 * The three assertions below make the two executors PARTITION the contract:
 * every declared key is DOM-handled, forwarded here, or named as one the
 * factory itself owns. A key added to `FieldWidgetComponentProps` that is none
 * of those is a compile error, so the next non-DOM key cannot repeat this bug.
 *
 * ## Precedence: this is a CONDUIT, and never a second authority
 *
 * Several of these keys have a context-based fallback inside the widget that
 * reads them, so DELIVERING one can change behaviour where before it could not
 * arrive at all. The rule is stated once, here, and this function implements it
 * by doing nothing: it forwards what the host passed and resolves NOTHING.
 * Each key's precedence stays where its single reader already implements and
 * documents it —
 *
 *  - `dataSource`: **the explicit prop WINS** over `SchemaRendererContext`.
 *    `LookupField` already resolves exactly that order and says so on the line
 *    that does it: "explicit prop > field-level > wrapper field >
 *    SchemaRendererContext > none". Hosts that pass nothing keep reading the
 *    context, so the grid's inline editor is unaffected.
 *  - `dependentValues`: the explicit prop is the ONLY channel that can carry a
 *    record — the host supplies it, and there is NO context fallback. Both
 *    readers (`useCascadingOptions`, and `LookupField`'s own resolver) used to
 *    spell a `?? ctx.formValues ?? ctx.data` tail after it, but
 *    `SchemaRendererContextType` declares exactly `dataSource` / `debug` /
 *    `debugFlags` / `apiFetch` — neither member exists, so that tail was
 *    unconditionally `{}` and no host could change it. It was retired under
 *    ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove (objectui#7206). Unlike `dataSource` above,
 *    DELIVERING this key cannot displace a context value, because there has
 *    never been one to displace.
 *  - `dependsOn`: the FIELD METADATA wins over the prop — the one documented
 *    inversion, stated on the key's own doc comment and implemented as
 *    `field?.dependsOn ?? dependsOnProp` in all four option widgets.
 *  - `emptyHint`: the host's value wins when supplied (objectui#3231).
 *  - `onCreateNew`: the prop wins over `field.onCreateNew`; `onSelectRecord`
 *    has no metadata carrier at all, so the prop is its ONLY one.
 *
 * Resolving any of that HERE would give each key a second author — the
 * `field || schema` shape objectui#3233 spent a release removing. One key, one
 * resolver, in the widget that reads it.
