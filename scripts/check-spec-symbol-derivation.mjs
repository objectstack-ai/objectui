/**
 * A spec-named symbol must be DERIVED from `@objectstack/spec`, not hand-written.
 *
 * The failure class (objectstack#4115): objectui declares a local type or const
 * under the SAME NAME as a `@objectstack/spec` export, with a doc comment
 * claiming spec canonicity — and the declaration has drifted, or is one spec
 * release away from drifting. Every audited instance had:
 *
 *   ActionType            "canonical definition from @objectstack/spec"  → hand union, missing `form`   (#2231/#2901)
 *   ChartType             (sibling schema re-exported under spec's name) → 7 of 19 members             (objectui#2944)
 *   ActionLocation + 2    "single source of truth… re-export here"       → re-DECLARED union + z.enum   (#4074)
 *   ActionParamFieldType  "aligned with the field types available in spec" → 16 of 49 members           (#4074)
 *
 * What makes this class expensive is specific to agent-driven development: an
 * agent reads the comment, takes it as ground truth, and builds on it. #2901 was
 * filed with a backwards premise because the fork was re-exported under the
 * spec's own symbol name. A wrong canonical-claim is not stale documentation —
 * it is a planted premise for the next session.
 *
 * This guard lands the rule AS THE CHECK, not as an AGENTS.md paragraph. A
 * prose-only rule is precisely the "declared ≠ enforced" landmine the whole
 * thread is about (#4074, objectui#3009 — where a guard file's own header
 * falsely claimed its checks were "the real enforcement" for the entire interval
 * during which nothing compiled them).
 *
 * ── What counts as derived ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Both of the repo's sanctioned forms pass, because both bind the local name to
 * the spec at compile time:
 *
 *   export type { ActionLocation } from '@objectstack/spec/ui';   // re-export
 *   export type ActionType = z.infer<typeof SpecActionType>;      // derivation
 *
 * A declaration is derived only when the spec reference sits in a STRUCTURAL
 * position — a type alias's own type node, an interface's `extends`, a const's
 * initializer. A spec name merely *mentioned* inside a members block does not
 * count, because that is what a hand-written fork looks like:
 *
 *   export interface ActionSchema { locations?: ActionLocation[] }   // NOT derived
 *
 * Consts are stricter still: object and array literals are not descended into.
 * `export const ACTION_LOCATIONS = [...SpecLocations]` is a COPY, and a faithful
 * copy passes every value comparison — reference identity is the only check that
 * distinguishes a re-export from a fork (objectui#3003, and the insight already
 * written down in `spec-subschema-parity.test.ts`).
 *
 * ── Rule 2: a spec-alignment CLAIM must have something behind it ─────────────
 * Everything above matches BY NAME, and that is the hole objectui#4592 records:
 * a hand copy that was RENAMED away from the spec's symbol has nothing for rule
 * 1 to match, so it passes every run. `ViewNavigationConfig`
 * (packages/types/src/objectql.ts, objectui#4588) was exactly that — the spec's
 * six navigation keys, hand-written, drifted on `mode` (required here, published
 * input-optional by the spec's `.default('page')`), carrying the comment
 * "Aligned with @objectstack/spec ListView.navigation". It was found by a manual
 * census, not by a check.
 *
 * The measured decision (objectui#4592, census in the PR): the STRUCTURAL
 * alternative — "does this local type mirror a spec object's key set, whatever
 * it is called" — was built as a one-off and run over the tree. It reports 38
 * sites at >= 0.80 key overlap, nearly all of them legitimately distinct layers
 * (`ApprovalActionLite`, `SimEdge`, `BulkResult`). An ALLOW map with 38 entries
 * is not a guard, it is a second copy of the codebase, so that instrument was
 * NOT built. Worse for it: the census cannot see the biggest sub-class at all —
 * eight declarations here claim alignment with spec symbols that the installed
 * spec does not export (`ReactionSchema`, `DateFormatSchema`, …), and a key-set
 * comparison has nothing to compare against.
 *
 * What both known instances DID carry is the prose claim. So rule 2 is a
 * heuristic on that claim, and it is deliberately cheap:
 *
 *   FLAG an exported declaration when its own doc comment claims alignment with
 *   `@objectstack/spec` AND the declaration references no spec-bound identifier
 *   anywhere in its body.
 *
 * Claim = one of these phrases, case-insensitive, within CLAIM_WINDOW characters
 * of an `@objectstack/spec` mention in the SAME comment block:
 *
 *   aligned with / aligns with / spec-aligned   mirrors / mirrored / mirroring
 *   matches / matching                          same shape|keys|union|vocabulary as
 *   identical to                                in sync with
 *   canonical                                   source of truth
 *   copy of / copied from                       conforms to
 *
 * Three precision rules, each of which removed real false positives from the
 * measured run — they are load-bearing, not decoration:
 *
 *   - Only the comment block ATTACHED to the declaration is read, never the
 *     file's licence banner. Reading all leading comments let a banner's prose
 *     supply the claim phrase for whichever declaration happened to sit first.
 *   - The claim phrase must sit within CLAIM_WINDOW of the spec mention.
 *     `ChartDataSeries` (packages/types/src/data-display.ts) reads "positionally
 *     aligned with the chart's `categories`" and separately explains what
 *     `@objectstack/spec/ui` owns — a model citizen that a bare co-occurrence
 *     test flags and a proximity test does not.
 *   - Renderers are not shapes. A function, class, or const initialised with an
 *     arrow/function/call expression is skipped, on the same judgement that was
 *     once written by hand as the ALLOW entries for `AuthProvider` / `ListView`
 *     / `UserFilters` and is now made structurally by rule 1's `rendersJsx` (all
 *     three entries are gone; their tombstones are in ALLOW): a component that
 *     RENDERS the spec's shape is not a second declaration of it, so "Aligned
 *     with @objectstack/spec ReactionSchema" on a `<ReactionPicker>` is a
 *     statement about what it draws.
 *
 * ── The tie is judged against the symbols the claim CITES (objectui#4607) ────
 * The tie test above asks "does this declaration reference ANY spec-bound
 * identifier". That question is symbol-AGNOSTIC, so a claim about symbol X
 * passed on an incidental reference to an unrelated symbol Y.
 *
 * The measured specimen: `FeedItem` (packages/types/src/views.ts) carried
 * "Aligned with @objectstack/spec FeedItemSchema" while `FeedItemSchema` had
 * been removed from `@objectstack/spec/data` in the 16.0.0 major — and it never
 * appeared in a single gate run, purely because one member is typed
 * `FeedItemType`, the one feed symbol that survived the removal. It sat four
 * lines from a section banner making the same claim, in the same file as four
 * declarations that WERE flagged, and it was found by reading the file rather
 * than by any run of this script.
 *
 * Note the asymmetry, which is what made it expensive: the more spec-integrated
 * a declaration is, the weaker the check on its prose became. A fully
 * hand-written fork got its claim scrutinised; one importing a single live spec
 * type for one member did not.
 *
 * Hence the fourth precision rule, deliberately narrow:
 *
 *   When the claim NAMES symbols and EVERY one of them is absent from the
 *   installed spec's export set, the declaration is flagged whatever else it
 *   references. A tie to a DIFFERENT symbol is not something behind THIS claim.
 *
 * Two limits on it, both deliberate:
 *
 *   - A claim naming at least one LIVE symbol stays governed by the tie test
 *     above, unchanged. A claim citing live `A` while tied to live `B` is a
 *     claim-vs-tie MISMATCH, and judging those is a KNOWN NON-GOAL of this rule
 *     (objectui#4607). It would need a name-relatedness allowance for the
 *     legitimate `type: FeedItemType` shape — where the citation and the tie are
 *     genuinely different-but-related symbols — and that allowance is a
 *     different instrument, not a tightening of this one.
 *   - Given no spec export set to check against, nothing can be known to dangle
 *     and this rule stays out of the way entirely. A verdict fabricated from
 *     ignorance of the spec would flag every citation in the repo at once.
 *
 * ── Rule 4 at MEMBER granularity (objectui#7513) ────────────────────────────
 * Rule 4 above judges the SYMBOL a claim cites. It cannot see a citation that
 * names a live symbol and a key that symbol does not have, and that is the shape
 * three measured comments took:
 *
 *   `SelectOptionSchema.description`  the option schema is `.strict()` and spells
 *                                     five keys, none of them `description`
 *   `FieldSchema.rows`                `rows` is not a field key at all
 *   `DashboardSchema.title`           the dashboard display name is `label`
 *
 * Every one of them named a symbol the spec really exports, so rule 4 passed
 * them, and every one of them was inviting a `422 INVALID_METADATA` — the option
 * two routed a `description` into a `.strict()` option schema, which refuses the
 * WHOLE field. So the citation is checked at the granularity it was written at:
 *
 *   A comment citing `SpecSymbol.key`, where the spec's own shape for that
 *   symbol has no `key`, is a dangling reference and is flagged.
 *
 * This is rule 4 tightened, not a second instrument: same question (is there
 * anything behind what this comment points at), same answer when the answer is
 * "no", no allowlist and no ledger of its own. Fresh citations fail on the PR
 * that writes them; there is nothing here to accrue.
 *
 * Where it looks, and why that is WIDER than rule 2's jurisdiction without being
 * rule 2's deferred widening (objectui#7513 defers that as B): every comment in
 * the scanned files, not only the block attached to a top-level declaration.
 * Two of the three specimens sat on interface MEMBERS and one sat inside a
 * function body, so a declaration-scoped scan sees none of them. It is not the
 * same widening because it asks a different question: rule 2 asks whether a
 * DECLARATION has a compile-time tie behind its claim, which needs a declaration
 * and a tie test; this asks only whether a NAME the prose spells exists in the
 * spec, which needs neither. It also needs no claim phrase — one specimen read
 * "Per @objectstack/spec, DashboardSchema.title is …", which no phrase table
 * matches and which is wrong all the same.
 *
 * Four precision rules, each measured against the tree rather than imagined:
 *
 *   - The comment must mention `@objectstack/spec`, and the citation must sit
 *     within CLAIM_WINDOW of that mention IN THE SAME SENTENCE — rule 2's
 *     proximity discipline, reused rather than reinvented. Without it,
 *     `ListView.resolveTimelineDateBinding` (a method on this repo's own
 *     component, 755 characters from an unrelated spec mention) and
 *     `NavigationItem.label` read as spec citations. Measured: 136 raw citations
 *     tree-wide collapse to 73 real ones.
 *   - A `/` on either side makes it a PATH, not a citation. `@objectstack/spec`
 *     `ui/TimelineConfig.json` is a file the comment is pointing at, and
 *     `json`/`tsx` are not members of anything.
 *   - The member set is the union over the spec's symbol FAMILY — `N`,
 *     `NSchema`, `NInput`, `NParsed` — taken on the AUTHORING side (a schema's
 *     `.shape`, hopping through a `ZodPipe`'s `.in`) rather than the parsed
 *     output. A citation names a concept, and the spec publishes a concept as a
 *     family. ⭐ This is load-bearing, not tidiness: `FormField.visibleOn` is a
 *     real authorable key that the spec's OUTPUT type deliberately drops
 *     (`type FormField = Omit< z.infer< … >, 'visibleOn' > & …`), so reading the
 *     output type alone reports a correct comment as dangling.
 *   - Zod's own API is excluded BY RULE, two predicates, never by allowlist
 *     entries — see `isZodApiCitation`.
 *
 * MEASURED on `1bae75bb` against `@objectstack/spec@17.2.0`:
 *
 *   raw `Symbol.member` citations in spec-mentioning comments   136
 *   within CLAIM_WINDOW and the same sentence                    73
 *     resolve against the family's authored shape                64
 *     excluded as Zod API (5 call-form, 4 vocabulary)             9
 *     member set unknowable, rule stays out                       0
 *     DANGLING                                                    0
 *
 * Zero, because all three specimens were repaired before this landed (PR #7510,
 * PR #7520) — which is why the pin in `scripts/__tests__/` asserts the rule goes
 * RED on their verbatim PRE-repair text. A ratchet that only proves green on
 * today's tree proves nothing about the tightening. These figures are a
 * SNAPSHOT, under the same discipline the sections above record: when they move,
 * re-take them and re-name the commit and the spec version.
 *
 * ── The boundary the rules USED to share: exported only (objectui#5899) ─────
 * ⛔ HISTORY, NOT BEHAVIOUR. Neither scanner has an export filter today. Both
 * halves went in objectui#6291, and the two `// No export filter (objectui#6291)`
 * comments in `scanFileForClaims` and `scanFile` are where that is stated at the
 * code. Read this section for WHY the filter was dropped and what dropping it
 * measured — never as a description of what the scanners currently do.
 *
 * The tense matters more here than it looks. This paragraph used to describe the
 * filter in the present, beside a `hasExportModifier` helper that had already
 * lost its last call site, and a card was filed on the strength of it: it
 * explained a gate's blindness as "both rules skip any declaration without an
 * `export` modifier (`hasExportModifier`, applied once per scanner)", which had
 * not been true since objectui#6291. The author did not invent that — they read
 * it HERE. A guard whose own header teaches a retired rule is the same planted
 * premise this file exists to catch, wearing the maintainer's clothes, so the
 * helper is gone too (objectui#7513) and there is nothing left to grep into a
 * false conclusion.
 *
 * What the filter WAS, in the past tense it belongs in: each scanner skipped any
 * statement without an `export` modifier, once per scanner. The class was
 * therefore NOT fully covered by rule 1 plus rule 2 — a module-local declaration
 * sat outside the jurisdiction of both, whatever it was named and whatever its
 * doc comment claimed. Read on for what each half cost.
 *
 * The filter was defensible on this script's own terms: an unexported type
 * cannot be imported by another package under the spec's name, so it cannot
 * become a planted premise through the package's public surface. objectui#5652
 * measured the other half. Three hand-written mirrors of the `FormViewSchema`
 * contract in `packages/react/src/spec-bridge/bridges/form-view.ts` had drifted
 * on three keys and had INVERTED one arm — it admitted only the value the
 * contract rejects — and two of the three were declared under the spec's own
 * export names (`FormField`, `FormSection`), which is precisely rule 1's
 * trigger. The gate was green throughout, because all three were module-local
 * `interface`s; they were found by a human reading the file. An unexported
 * mirror is not imported, but it is still READ by the next agent editing that
 * file, and it still drifts.
 *
 * What the filter cost, MEASURED (objectui#5899) on `a76b18cf2` against
 * `@objectstack/spec@17.2.0` — same instrumented-copy method objectui#4592
 * used. ⚠️ The instrument was an INSTRUMENTED COPY that re-imposed the filter on
 * both scanners, not a switch either scanner still carries; the numbers are the
 * measured price of the filter, taken while it still existed:
 *
 *   rule 1   18 findings → 47   (+29 module-local declarations)
 *   rule 2   20 findings → 22   (+2  module-local declarations)
 *   distinct additional declarations: 30 (one is flagged by both rules)
 *
 * Classified by READING every site; the per-entry census is in objectui#5899's
 * PR body:
 *
 *   22 of 30 are REAL MIRRORS of the spec symbol they are named after, and 12
 *   of those carry a divergence measurable TODAY rather than merely possible.
 *   `FlowNode` (metadata-admin/inspectors/FlowNodeInspector.tsx) declares a
 *   `description` key the spec's `.strict()` `FlowNodeSchema` REJECTS, and
 *   makes `label` optional where the spec requires it. `AppLike`, `ObjectLike`,
 *   `RemoteTable` and `FlowRuntimeState` each relax a spec-REQUIRED key to
 *   optional. `CURATED_CAPABILITY_LABELS` says it mirrors `PLATFORM_CAPABILITIES`
 *   and is missing the member the spec has since added (`manage_sharing`), so
 *   that capability silently loses its localized label.
 *   `EXPLAIN_BATCH_MAX_RECORD_IDS` states in its own comment that it exists
 *   only until the spec pin exports it — and the pin now does. `ActionParam`
 *   and `FlowEdge` each exist TWICE inside one package, and each pair already
 *   disagrees with itself.
 *
 *   8 of 30 are legitimate module-local shapes, in two kinds. Four are
 *   different concepts sharing a name — `SearchResult` (the spec's is the
 *   search RESPONSE `{hits,totalHits,…}`; this is one result ROW), `Dimension`,
 *   `ModelConfig`, and two local React `Field` components. Four are ALREADY
 *   derived, one hop outside where this scan looks: `type FlowNode =
 *   FlowDesignerNode` and its edge twin alias the canvas's own types, and
 *   `DashboardWidget` aliases an `@object-ui/types` schema that is itself
 *   spec-derived.
 *
 * That census forced the split ruled in objectui#6291: rule 2's filter is a
 * clean one-liner, rule 1's is a scoped change, and doing both at once would
 * land 29 reds and four avoidable waivers against this header's own standard
 * that an ALLOW map with dozens of entries is not a guard.
 *
 * ── Rule 2's half of the split: SHIPPED (objectui#6291) ─────────────────────
 * `scanFileForClaims` no longer filters on `export`. Re-measured on the
 * implementing commit against `@objectstack/spec@17.2.0` — the a76b18cf2
 * figures above had already moved, which is exactly why they are re-taken
 * rather than transcribed:
 *
 *   rule 2   18 unbacked claims → 19   (+1 module-local declaration)
 *
 * ONE, not the two measured at a76b18cf2. `CURATED_CAPABILITY_LABELS`
 * (packages/fields) was the other, and objectui#6285 fixed it in the interval:
 * its comment no longer claims alignment in prose, because
 * `CapabilityMultiSelectField.specParity-6285.test.tsx` now CHECKS the equality
 * against `PLATFORM_CAPABILITIES` in both directions. That is the burn-down
 * this rule exists to provoke, and it took the site out of the population
 * before this change could reach it.
 *
 * The one that remains, `CONTEXT_TOKEN_SUGGESTIONS` (@object-ui/core), is a
 * real mirror and goes to CLAIM_DEBT — see the note there for why a
 * shrink-only block is allowed to grow on a jurisdiction widening. Zero
 * legitimate-local fallout, zero CLAIM_ALLOW entries, and the named pin in
 * `scripts/__tests__/check-spec-symbol-derivation.test.ts` was REWRITTEN
 * rather than deleted: it now asserts that a module-local claim IS flagged,
 * beside a second case proving the precision rules — not the `export` keyword
 * — are what keep module-local shapes green.
 *
 * ── Rule 1's half of the split: SHIPPED (objectui#6291) ────────────────────
 * `scanFile` no longer filters on `export` either, and the population it
 * surfaces was scoped first by the two structural narrowings the ruling
 * required. Re-measured on the implementing commit against
 * `@objectstack/spec@17.2.0`:
 *
 *   rule 1, filter dropped, NO narrowings   0 untriaged → 25   (+25)
 *   rule 1, filter dropped, narrowings on   0 untriaged → 19   (+19)
 *
 * 25, not the 29 measured at a76b18cf2. Four sites left the population in the
 * interval, and reading why is the whole argument for re-taking rather than
 * transcribing: `ActionParam` twice (b84dc18 consolidated the two copies that
 * already disagreed with each other), `SelectOption`, and
 * `EXPLAIN_BATCH_MAX_RECORD_IDS` (objectui#6286 — the one whose own comment
 * said it existed only until the spec pin exported the constant).
 *
 * The two narrowings, and what each measurably retires:
 *
 *   `rendersJsx`   — 2 module-local React `Field` components (metadata-admin
 *                    inspectors). ⚠️ NOT `isRendererLike`, which rule 2 uses;
 *                    see that function's own comment for the two REAL MIRRORS a
 *                    blanket "functions are renderers" would have silenced.
 *   `isPureAlias`  — 4 aliases: the `FlowNode`/`FlowEdge` pair in FlowPreview,
 *                    and the pair in FlowNodeInspector, which became aliases in
 *                    the interval too (the census had them as real mirrors, one
 *                    of them declaring a `description` key the spec's `.strict()`
 *                    schema rejects; that is fixed at the site now).
 *
 * The remaining 19 split 4 / 15:
 *
 *   4 are different-concept name collisions and got reasoned ALLOW entries —
 *   `SearchResult` (a result ROW, where the spec's is the search RESPONSE),
 *   `Dimension` (the spec's cube dimension REQUIRES `sql` and REJECTS this
 *   shape's own `field`/`dateGranularity` — probed, not guessed), `ModelConfig`
 *   (a model SELECTION against a model REGISTRY RECORD), and `DashboardWidget`
 *   (already derived one hop out, deliberately widened).
 *
 *   15 findings under 14 names are real mirrors and were seeded into DEBT
 *   mechanically by `--ledger`, anchored on objectui#7265.
 *
 * Two ALLOW entries were DELETED by the same commit, and this is the part that
 * exceeded what the ruling predicted: `@object-ui/auth:AuthProvider` and
 * `@object-ui/plugin-list:UserFilters` stopped matching anything, because
 * `rendersJsx` now makes structurally the judgement those entries made by hand.
 * Ratchet 3 requires deleting an entry that excuses nothing — a stale entry
 * reserves the name for a future fork under it — so the narrowing SHRANK the
 * hand-written part of the map while the collisions grew it. Both deletions are
 * documented in place, with what each entry carried beyond the waiver. Net:
 * 16 declared dialects → 18.
 *
 * These figures are a SNAPSHOT. When they move, re-take them and re-name the
 * commit and the spec version — never edit the numbers in place under the old
 * ones. That is the same discipline `scripts/invoked-as.mjs` records for its
 * own measured section (objectui#6260/#6274), and for the same reason: a
 * refreshed count under a stale commit is a measurement nobody can reproduce.
 *
 * `SpecAuthoredInput` (@object-ui/react) counts as derivation evidence by name:
 * its entire purpose is to bind a local type to a spec schema's authoring input.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs
 *       node scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs --ledger        (rule 1 DEBT)
 *       node scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs --claim-ledger  (rule 2 ledger)
 * Exit: 0 = OK, 1 = a spec-named symbol is hand-written, a spec-alignment claim
 *       has nothing behind it, or either allowlist/ledger is stale

// Named symbols rather than a per-package COUNT, deliberately: a count is a

// the same PR, and it makes the failure message point at whichever collisions
// happen to sort first instead of at the one just written. The list is longer;
// it is also the thing that names the new symbol at the moment it appears.
//
// To burn one down: import/derive it from the spec, rename it to a declared
// local dialect (`ObjectUiLocal…`, with a tripwire test asserting the spec does
// not own the name), or move it to ALLOW with the reason it deliberately
// differs. Then delete it from this list — leaving it here fails the ratchet.
//
// ── Triage first, and do not trust `extends` alone ───────────────────────────
// The obvious way to decide whether a collision is a safe re-export is to ask
// the compiler whether the two types are mutually assignable:
//
//     type A = [Local] extends [Spec] ? true : false
//     type B = [Spec] extends [Local] ? true : false   // A && B → "identical"
//
// That question lies in three ways, and all three occur in this repo. Check for
// them BEFORE acting on an "identical" verdict:
//
//   1. The local declaration resolves to `any` — a recursive zod schema
//      annotated `z.ZodType<any>` (`FilterConditionSchema`,
//      `NavigationItemSchema`). `any` answers every assignability question
//      affirmatively.  Detect: `0 extends (1 & Local) ? true : false`.
//   2. The SPEC export resolves to `any`. Re-exporting such a symbol REPLACES a
//      precise local interface with `any` — a type-safety regression wearing a
//      burn-down's clothes. Detect: the same `0 extends (1 & Spec)` probe — but
//      see 2b and 2c, which that probe does NOT catch.
//
//      History worth keeping, because it is the reason this whole list exists:
//      `NavigationItem`, `JoinNode` and `FormField` were the instances, filed
//      upstream as objectstack#4171. All three are resolved as premises now —
//      `JoinNode` was retired with `query.joins` (framework#4286) and the other
//      two were typed properly in spec 17.0.0-rc.1 — and NEITHER became
//      derivable as a result (objectui#3177). Do not read "no longer `any`" as
//      "safe to bind"; see 2c.
//   2c. The SPEC export is typed but NOT PRECISE, which the `any` and `unknown`
//      probes both report as clean. Two live instances, each pinned with a probe
//      that asks its real blocker (objectui#3177):
//        - `ConditionalValidation.then` / `.otherwise` are
//          `BaseValidationRuleShape` — `type: string` plus `[key: string]:
//          unknown`, i.e. case 3 on the SPEC side. Deriving swaps a
//          discriminated union for a bag. Blocked on objectstack#4075.
//          Detect: `string extends Spec['type']`, and the case-3 probe.
//        - `NavigationItem` / `FormField` are precise but describe a DIFFERENT
//          shape (a nine-variant union vs objectui's flat one) or a different
//          LAYER (spec `field` = an object-field reference; objectui `name` =
//          the form data path, with disjoint required keys). Precision is not
//          equivalence. Detect: per-key, per-tier probes — a structural
//          `extends` permits excess properties and so cannot see a key the spec
//          does not declare.
//      Both sets live in `spec-derived-unions.test.ts` /
//      `validation-rule-spec-parity.test.ts`, written to fail the day the
//      blocker they name lifts.
//   2b. The SPEC export resolves to `unknown` (`JoinedReportBlock`, whose
//      `JoinedReportBlockSchema` the spec declares as `z.ZodTypeAny`). Just as
//      empty as case 2 and just as unburnable, but the `any` probe reports
//      `false` for it, so a triage that only screens for `any` waves it through
//      as "safely derivable". Detect: `[unknown] extends [Spec]`. Pinned in
//      packages/types/src/__tests__/report-chart-query-spec-parity.test.ts
//      (objectui#3155); also filed under objectstack#4171.
//   3. The local declaration carries `[key: string]: any` (`FormField`,
//      `AppSchema`, `PageSchema`, `ThemeSchema`, …) — the objectstack#4075
//      mechanism. An index signature absorbs any extra member, so the two types
//      compare equal while accepting wildly different objects.
//      Detect: `string extends keyof Local ? true : false`.
//
// A zod schema needs one more question than a type does: `_output` equality is
// not enough, because two schemas can agree on output and still accept different
// AUTHORING input. `FormFieldSchema` is exactly that — identical `_output`,
// divergent `_input` — so re-exporting it would silently change what parses.
// Compare `_input` too before touching a schema const.
// Re-anchored at objectui#6291. It was `4115` (objectstack#4115) while the block

// across nine packages in one card (objectui#4592 owns `scripts/**` only, and
// most of these surfaces belong to other seats).
//
// To burn one down, pick whichever is true of the declaration:
//   - derive it (`z.infer< typeof SpecX >`, `SpecAuthoredInput< … >`, or an
//     import of the spec type) — the claim becomes structural and the entry goes;

// 2 stopped skipping module-local declarations in the same commit, so
// `CONTEXT_TOKEN_SUGGESTIONS` (@object-ui/core) is a pre-existing claim the rule
// could not previously SEE, not a new one somebody wrote. It is a real mirror —
// byte-identical to `@objectstack/spec/data`'s nine-entry map — and 25 lines
// above it the same file explains that its neighbour `CONTEXT_TOKENS` became a
// re-export precisely because "the copy was byte-identical, so every value
// comparison and every behavioural test passed while it sat here". Burning it
// down is the same edit that fixed the neighbour; it is listed rather than
// excused because nothing about it is deliberate. Widening a rule's
// jurisdiction is the ONLY sanctioned way this block grows, and it must be
// mechanically regenerated (`--claim-ledger`) in that same commit.
//
// Eight entries left by that last route in objectui#4597 — the i18n formatters'
// four and views.ts's four, which cited `DateFormatSchema`, `NumberFormatSchema`,
// `PluralRuleSchema`, `LocaleConfigSchema`, `FieldChangeEntrySchema`,
// `MentionSchema`, `ReactionSchema` and `RecordSubscriptionSchema`. Measuring
// them answered the question #4597 left open, and the answer was NOT "these
// names never existed": all eight were real exports the protocol RETIRED, and
// each local key set was faithful to the schema it named. The feed four went
// from `@objectstack/spec/data` in the 16.0.0 major (feed surface replaced by
// the data API over `sys_comment` / `sys_activity`); the i18n four went from
// `@objectstack/spec/ui` in 17.0.0-rc.6 itself — present through rc.5 — under
// ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove (objectstack#5055). Their comments now record that
// provenance instead of vouching for a symbol the pinned spec has dropped.
//
// Worth keeping for whoever measures the next batch: "the installed spec does
// not export it" does not distinguish a name that never existed from one the
// protocol retired on purpose, and the fix differs. Read the spec's CHANGELOG
// and its own retirement notes before concluding a citation was always wrong.

 * function with `derived: false` — so reusing `isRendererLike` verbatim would
 * skip every spec-named function in the tree.
 *
 * Measured, that is not the same set. On the objectui#6291 commit, dropping
 * rule 1's export filter surfaces four module-local functions: two React
 * components named `Field` (metadata-admin inspectors, wrapping a child in a
 * `<div>` with a hint line), and `isContextToken` / `normalizeFilterOperator` —
 * a type-guard predicate and an alias-table normalizer, both classified REAL

 * (`normalizeFilterOperator` is a SECOND normalizer over the spec's, and two
 * normalizers disagreeing about filter operators is the silent over-fetch class
 * of objectstack#3948). A blanket "functions are renderers" would have made
 * those two invisible rather than DEBT entries — silently, and for good.
 *
 * So the narrowing here tests the judgement the header actually states — "a
 * component that RENDERS the spec's shape is not a second declaration of it" —
 * literally: the declaration must contain JSX. A predicate returning `boolean`
 * does not; a component returning `<div>` does. Nested functions are not
 * excluded from the walk on purpose: a helper that builds JSX inside a
 * non-rendering function is vanishingly rarer than the false negative that
 * excluding it would buy, and the fallback for a genuine miss is an ALLOW entry
