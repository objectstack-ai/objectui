/**
 * Shared FLAT field builder for the overlay form containers (Modal / Drawer).
 *
 * `ModalForm` and `DrawerForm` each accept `objectName` (plus an optional
 * `fields` whitelist) with NO `sections` and no `customFields`. In that shape
 * there is no section to normalize, so both used to build the runtime
 * `FormField` list inline — two hand-copied loops over the same "object-schema
 * field to runtime FormField" mapping that `sectionFields`' `fromObjectSchema`
 * already owns for the sectioned path.
 *
 * They drifted, exactly as duplicated mappings do (objectui#4755): the modal's
 * copy carried the ADR-0036 field-level rules (`visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` /
 * `requiredWhen`) and the field-group membership (`group`), the drawer's copy
 * stopped at `multiple`. A drawer form opened over an object declaring
 * conditional rules therefore ignored every one of them — a `visibleWhen`-FALSE
 * field rendered anyway, a `readonlyWhen`-TRUE field stayed editable (and the
 * server then dropped the write), and `requiredWhen` never fired. Nothing was
 * broken in the renderer: `resolveFieldRuleState` simply never received the
 * predicates, because the builder did not copy them onto the FormField.
 *
 * So there is now ONE mapping in this package, shared by all three producers —
 * this module for the flat path, `buildSectionFields` for the sectioned path,
 * both resolving each field through `fromObjectSchema`. The next widget-arity
 * fix (#3986), create-mode `required` rule (#4069) or ADR-0036 key lands once
 * and reaches every container.
