/**
 * The PageHeader docs demo renders the COMPONENT, not a hand-rolled header
 * (objectui#3787).
 *
 * `layout-page-header/pageheader-with-actions` is the only runnable example on
 * `content/docs/layout/page-header.mdx`. It used to be a `div`/`text`/`button`
 * tree carrying Tailwind classes copied out of `PageHeader.tsx` — so the page
 * documenting the component shipped a copy-paste reference that told authors
 * (AI authors included) to bypass it, it exercised none of `page-header`'s
 * rendering, and it held a third, already-drifted copy of the component's
 * spacing numbers (objectui#3786 fixed the second copy, in the prose).
 *
 * Five things are pinned here, and they are different facts:
 *
 *  1. SHAPE — the example's root node is a `page-header`, and it contains none
 *     of the class strings that only exist inside `PageHeader.tsx`. This is the
 *     regression that would fire if anyone hand-rolls the header again.
 *  2. RENDER — driven through the real `SchemaRenderer`, the node produces the
 *     header: an `<h1>` title, the subtitle, and BOTH schema children in the
 *     right-hand slot.
 *  3. VALIDATE — the same JSON, put through the manifest the app really builds
 *     from the live registry, draws no `not-a-container` diagnostic (#3900).
 *  4. VALIDATE, PROPS — the same JSON draws no `unknown-prop` either, and an
 *     array-valued `navigation-renderer.items` draws no `type-mismatch` (#3972).
 *     Same lie as (3) on the prop face instead of the containment face.
 *  5. VALIDATE, OPTIONALITY — a `navigation-renderer` WITHOUT `items` now draws
 *     an error-level `missing-required-prop` (#3987), and the props the renderer
 *     defaults still draw nothing. Unlike (3) and (4) this one is a tightening,
 *     not a false-diagnostic fix; see that describe's header.
 *
 * (2) and (3) are two halves of one contradiction that used to be live. The
 * render path never consults `isContainer` — `SchemaRenderer` strips `children`
 * from the React props but always passes the whole node as `schema`, and
 * `PageHeader` re-introduces `schema.children` itself — so the header rendered
 * its children correctly while `packages/layout/src/index.ts` omitted
 * `isContainer: true` from the registration. The flag's consumers are elsewhere:
 * `sdui-parser`'s `not-a-container` diagnostic, the Studio palette, and the
 * react-page tag map. So the omission never blocked anything; it made the
 * VALIDATOR contradict the docs, the demo and the render — an author following
 * this very page got a warning telling them their working schema was invalid.
 * #3900 added the flag (maintainer ruling, route A: `children` is a base
 * property of every protocol node, not a `PageHeaderProps` key, so declaring it
 * mints no authoring surface outside the spec). (3) is what keeps the two faces
 * from drifting apart again in either direction.
 *
 * Module-scope imports, not `beforeAll` (AGENTS.md §测试纪律): the child
 * `button` node resolves through `@object-ui/components`' registration
 * side-effects, and paying that cost at import time keeps it out of every
 * test/hook timeout budget.
