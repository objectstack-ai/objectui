 * objectui#10485 — an authored `hideEmpty` on a `detail-section` node
 * VALIDATES and REACHES `DetailSection`.
 *
 * ## The gap
 *
 * `DetailSection` reads `section.hideEmpty === true` (the all-empty hide that
 * objectui#8603 restored), but the `detail-section` registration did not
 * declare `hideEmpty` among its `inputs`, and `DetailSectionNode` folds only
 * the declared names into the `section` it hands the component. So an author
 * who wrote `hideEmpty` on the node met both halves of one gap — the same two
 * halves objectui#9529 closed for `icon`:
 *
 *  - the JSX-page compiler's validator (a manifest built from
 *    `getKnownTypes()` plus these `inputs`, the way
 *    `packages/components/src/renderers/layout/page.tsx` builds it) warned
 *    `unknown-prop "hideEmpty"`, steering the author away from a key the
 *    renderer honours; and
 *  - the fold passed `hideEmpty` on as a host prop, which `DetailSection`
 *    ignores, so an all-empty section still drew its heading and skeleton.
 *
 * The triage on the card reuses objectui#9529's ruling (declare a key the
 * renderer already honours) and asks for the node's OMITTED default to be
 * stated. On this node it is one value: nothing on the node's path resolves a
 * default (`record:details` resolves `?? true` on its OWN authored sections,
 * which never pass through this node), and `DetailSection` tests `=== true`,
 * so an omitted key keeps the all-empty section. The declaration states that;
 * it does not change it.
 *
 * ## What each row reads, and why it is a verdict
 *
 * - VALIDATES — the node with an authored `hideEmpty` of either polarity draws
 *   ZERO diagnostics from the live manifest. The declared TYPE is read through
 *   the same judge: a non-boolean `hideEmpty` draws `type-mismatch` naming the
 *   key, which only a declared `boolean` input can produce (an undeclared key
 *   draws `unknown-prop` instead).
 * - THE CONTROL IS LIT — `name`, a `DetailViewSection` member this block
 *   neither declares nor reads, still draws `unknown-prop` from the same
 *   manifest in the same run. A silenced validator would pass the rows above
 *   vacuously; it cannot pass this one.
 * - REACHES `DetailSection` — measured in the DOM through the real
 *   `SchemaRenderer` and the real registry, over a record on which every field
 *   of the section is empty. `true` hides the section: no heading, no
 *   skeleton. A sibling node in the SAME render, identical but for the key,
 *   draws its heading and its placeholder, so the absence is a decision about
 *   `hideEmpty` and not an artefact of the fixture. `false` and an omitted key
 *   both keep the heading and the placeholder — the node's declared default.
