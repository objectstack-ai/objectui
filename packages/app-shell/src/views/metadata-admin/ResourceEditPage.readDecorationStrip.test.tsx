/**
 * Pins that the framework's READ DECORATIONS never reach the client edit gate
 * through the pending-draft merge (objectui#7603).
 *
 * ## The defect this file exists to keep fixed
 *
 * `client.getDraft()` serves a DECORATED body: the strict draft branch returns
 * `item: decorateMetadataItem(type, …)`, which attaches `_diagnostics` whenever
 * the type has a registered Zod schema, and `_draft` on the preview-draft
 * branch. The spec names both a READ-TIME decoration and says a served body
 * "is therefore NOT a valid input to the schema that produced it until these
 * are removed" — `METADATA_READ_DECORATIONS` in the spec kernel.
 *
 * `ResourceEditPage` merges that body over the layered baseline
 * (`{ ...baseline, ...draftReal }`) and hands the result to
 * `validateMetadataDraft`. The baseline half is clean — `getMetaItemLayered`
 * serves RAW layers — so the decoration arrives ONLY when the item has a
 * pending draft, which is why this stayed invisible: a no-draft case passes
 * today and cannot catch it. Every wired metadata type whose schema is
 * `.strict()` then reported a body THE SERVER ACCEPTS as `unrecognized_keys`,
 * putting a false "this item is invalid" banner plus inline field errors on an
 * author who is mid-edit.
 *
 * ## Why the fixture must carry a pending draft
 *
 * ⚠️ Drop the `getDraft` item from these cases and both of them still pass,
 * while the defect is fully present. The pending draft IS the trigger.
 *
 * ## The two directions, and why the second one is not optional
 *
 * A strip is only correct if it removes the framework's own keys and NOTHING
 * else. `unrecognizedGate` below feeds the same pending-draft path a body that
 * carries the two decorations AND one genuinely undeclared key, and requires
 * the gate to still refuse — naming the real key and neither decoration. That
 * case is also this file's CONTROL: it proves the gate actually runs on the
 * merged draft in this harness, so the first case's "no issues" is a measured
 * verdict rather than a validator that never fired.
 *
 * ⛔ The cure is never to loosen a schema. The ADR-0010 envelope keys
 * (`_lock`, `_provenance`, …) are allowlisted by the closed schemas ON PURPOSE
 * so provenance survives a re-parse; the decorations are not, and a gate that
 * tolerated them would destroy that distinction (AGENTS.md #0.1).
 *
 * ## Where the strip lives
 *
 * In `extractDraftBody` — the one function that turns a served draft envelope
 * into a body, and the chokepoint all THREE merge sites go through (the load
 * effect, the post-save refresh and the post-publish refresh). It reuses the
 * spec's exported `stripReadDecorations`, the same helper
 * `MetadataService.saveFields` already reaches for. ⛔ Never a second
 * hand-maintained `['_diagnostics', '_draft']` in objectui: a local copy goes
 * stale the next time the framework adds a decoration, and a decoration this
 * code does not know to remove is precisely the defect above.
