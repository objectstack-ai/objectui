/**
 * useApproverDirectory — resolve `<kind>:<value>` approver references against
 * the system directory objects, for the surfaces that must NAME an approver
 * (`77f846a8b`).
 *
 * ## Server-first, and inert by default
 *
 * The producer's own `pending_approver_names` is authoritative and this hook
 * never competes with it: callers pass only the references the server left
 * unresolved. On a backend that resolves everything the ref list is empty, the
 * effect returns before touching the adapter, and the record page issues not one
 * extra request. That gate is why a display fix can afford directory reads at
 * all.
 *
 * ## What it reads, and why the staffing leg is separate
 *
 *   - one `find` per distinct directory OBJECT (`sys_position`, `sys_team`,
 *     `sys_business_unit`, `sys_user`), batched with `$in` over that object's
 *     values — the label leg;
 *   - for `position` refs only, `sys_user_position` -> `sys_user` — the staffing
 *     leg, which answers "who actually sits in this seat" and, when it comes
 *     back empty, the unstaffed state `77f846a8b` surfaces.
 *
 * The two legs fail INDEPENDENTLY. A business-app reader may hold list access to
 * `sys_position` and none to `sys_user_position`; `find` rejects that with
 * `OBJECT_API_DISABLED` rather than an empty page. Folding the legs together
 * would let a permission error render as `销售经理(暂无在岗人员)` — a fabricated
 * fact on a governance surface. A failed staffing leg therefore leaves `holders`
 * `undefined` (unknown), which `approverDisplay` renders as silence, while the
 * label it did resolve still lands.
 *
 * ## The module-level cache
 *
 * `DeclaredActionsBar` mounts one component PER declared action, each asking
 * about the same slate; the panel asks again. Without dedupe an override on a
 * three-action request would fan one answer into a dozen requests. The cache is
 * keyed by the reference string and lives for the page session — a display
 * label, not a decision input, so a position renamed mid-session reading stale
 * until reload is the correct trade. `resetApproverDirectoryCache()` exists for
 * tests, which must not inherit each other's answers.
