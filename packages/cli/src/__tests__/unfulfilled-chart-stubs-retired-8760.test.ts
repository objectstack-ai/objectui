/**
 * `objectui check` refuses the three chart keys objectui#8760 retired — the
 * AUTHORING-TIME half of that retirement, on the published surface.
 *
 * ## Why this pin is the one that matters
 *
 * The card's grading rests on a comparison: "an unknown key is refused loudly
 * at authoring time; a registered-but-unfulfilled key passes every check, is
 * taught by the documentation, and fails only at render in front of a user."
 * `line-chart`, `area-chart` and `advanced-chart` were on the wrong side of it.
 * They were `registerLazy` stubs in `apps/console` that
 * `@object-ui/plugin-charts` never fulfilled, and a stub is enough to put a key
 * into `getKnownTypes()` — so the derivation behind `KNOWN_SCHEMA_TYPES`
 * carried all three (measured on `b775500af`: `line-chart`, `area-chart`,
 * `advanced-chart` and their three `plugin-charts:`-namespaced spellings) and
 * this command was SILENT on a document that could only ever paint a skeleton.
 *
 * So the outcome under test is the one an author observes from outside the
 * repository: the command now NAMES the type. Not "the key left the snapshot" —
 * that is the mechanism, and
 * `scripts/__tests__/known-schema-types-derivation-5115.test.ts` already holds
 * it against the derivation.
 *
 * ## The controls
 *
 * Silence is the pre-repair reading, so a test that only asserts warnings could
 * pass against a command that warns about everything. Two fulfilled variants
 * from the SAME stub sweep — `bar-chart` and `pie-chart` — must stay silent,
 * and so must the spelling the corrected documentation now teaches,
 * `{ "type": "chart", "chartType": "line" }`. Each is checked on its own: all
 * three are non-zero readings (a real registered key, judged), not an absence
 * that would read the same either way.
 *
 * Fixtures live under `os.tmpdir()` and carry the `className` marker, for the
 * two reasons `check-known-types.test.ts` states at length: a fixture inside
 * this workspace would be scanned by the repo's own `pnpm check`, and a file
 * with no ObjectUI marker key is not judged at all (objectui#5127) — which
 * would leave the silence assertions green while measuring nothing.
