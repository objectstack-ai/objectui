   * the cell formatter reads to resolve select options and reference values.
   *
   * ## Why the hook, and not the two `useState`s that were here
   *
   * This component used to carry the definition (`objectSchema`) and "has it
   * settled" (`schemaSettled`) as two SEPARATE pieces of state, the second a
   * one-way latch that nothing ever reset. Two independent values cannot
   * express "settled, but for a DIFFERENT object" — so on an object switch the
   * gate below read `schemaSettled === true` left over from the PREVIOUS
   * object's settle, while `objectSchema` still held the previous object's
   * fields, and the query went out as
   * `find(newObject, { $expand: [ …previous object's relation fields… ] })`:
   * rejected or silently ignored depending on the adapter, plus the transient
   * it painted, before a correct second query followed (objectui#6481).
   *
   * `useSettledSchema` holds ONE value, `{ key, def } | null`, and derives
   * readiness during render by comparing the settled key against `schemaKey`.
   * The gate therefore closes in the SAME commit that changes the object
   * rather than one commit later — and "ready for the wrong object" is not
   * merely fixed but unwritable, because there is no second piece of state
   * left to disagree with the first.
   *
   * ## The settle-on-every-exit guarantee, preserved
   *
   * The `finally` that used to live here existed so the two early `return`s
   * (no `dataSource` / no `getObjectSchema`; no object name) and a rejected
   * read all settled too — otherwise the gated record query below waits
   * forever, and a tree whose adapter serves no schema never renders a row.
   * The hook makes that structural rather than incidental: each of those exits
   * settles explicitly with `def: null`, which is a DISTINCT outcome from "not
   * ready yet". Both halves are pinned in
   * `ObjectTree.settledSchemaKeying-6481.test.tsx`.
   *
   * Gate PLACEMENT stays this component's own, per that same ruling: it sits

   * it, because the inline/static branches issue no metadata read and must not
   * be made to wait on one.
