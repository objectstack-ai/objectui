/**
 * objectui#6642: `scripts/pm/check-half-states.mjs` was copied here from
 * objectstack (objectui#5791) and then drifted for months with nothing able to
 * see it. Measured the day this gate landed: 9,340 lines here against 12,948
 * upstream — a 4,637-line `diff` — and 1,116 self-test cases here against
 * upstream's 1,574. The patrol kept rendering a confident report with the
 * missing predicates' rows simply absent.
 *
 * The gate closes that. This file pins the gate to its WIRING, in the direction
 * that goes wrong quietly: a parity check nobody runs is indistinguishable from
 * a parity check that passes — which is exactly the state the ported sweeper
 * was already in, one level down.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted here: any digest, any line count, or the number of
 * declared divergences. Those live in the pin, they move every time someone
 * re-syncs, and a copy of them here would be a second thing to keep honest —
 * the lesson `lint-workflow.test.ts` records at length for this same workflow.
 * What is asserted is that the mechanism is reachable, runs, and is not
 * vacuous.
