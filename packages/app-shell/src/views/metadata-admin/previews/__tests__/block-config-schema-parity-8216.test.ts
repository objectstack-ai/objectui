/**
 * `BLOCK_CONFIG` field names ↔ the schema each block is judged by (objectui#8216).
 *
 * `previews/block-config.ts`'s own header states the rule this file mechanises:
 *
 *   > Keep each field `name` aligned with the property name the corresponding
 *   > renderer reads.
 *
 * Nothing checked it. `scripts/check-designer-field-key-parity.mjs` judges
 * `PAYLOAD_SHAPES` — the field / object / permission payloads — and never reads
 * this table; `apps/console/src/__tests__/registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts`
 * judges the registry `inputs` declarations, a different table on a different
 * face. What existed here instead was a per-block prose pin in the sibling
 * `block-config.test.ts`, each written AFTER a defect was found by hand:
 * `page:header.icon` (objectui#3829), `page:accordion.title` and its items
 * `value` (objectui#5212), the `global_nav` option (objectstack#6888), and
 * `object-kanban` (objectui#7772). That is the voluntary shape objectui#8068
 * ruled insufficient one table over — three keys did it right and nothing
 * noticed the fourth.
 *
 * The measured cost of the absence is objectui#7772: for three months the
 * kanban panel's only grouping control wrote `groupField`, which
 * `ObjectKanbanSchema` refuses BY NAME, while the REQUIRED `groupBy` had no
 * control at all — so that panel could not author a valid board however it was
 * filled in, and every derived check stayed green.
 *
 * ## Two oracles, because `BLOCK_CONFIG` is keyed by DESIGNER block type
 *
 * That key is not one vocabulary, and the split is measured rather than
 * assumed. Both oracle tables are read whole and DERIVED — neither is listed
 * here, so a block that gains or loses a schema changes this file's verdict
 * without anyone editing it.
 *
 *   SPEC   `ComponentPropsMap[type]` from `@objectstack/spec/ui`. STRICT
 *          objects: an undeclared key draws `unrecognized_keys` naming it. This
 *          is the face that can REFUSE, and the one the platform's
 *          component-props lint dispatches on — `PageComponent.properties` is
 *          `z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())`, so the page parse itself never
 *          descends into a block's props and `ComponentPropsMap[type]` is
 *          reachable only by dispatching on the sibling `type`
 *          (the spec's own note on `lintUnknownKeysAgainstSchema`).
 *
 *   NODE   the `@object-ui/types/zod` component arms, indexed by the `type`
 *          literal each one declares. These extend `BaseSchema`, which is
 *          `.passthrough()`, so an undeclared key here is not refused — it
 *          stops being JUDGED and the value is kept (objectui#7664's measured
 *          mechanism). A violation on this face is therefore a DECLARATION
 *          gap, not a refusal, and the two are reported under distinct ids for
 *          that reason. It is also the only face carrying
 *          `retirementTombstone()`, which is why the retired direction below
 *          cannot be measured without it.
 *
 * A block may resolve on both (`object-grid`, `object-form`, `object-kanban`),
 * on one (`grid` — node only; every `page:*` / `record:*` / `element:*` spec
 * type — spec only), or on neither. Neither is an EXPLICIT exemption with a
 * reason and a card, never a silent skip — the idiom is
 * `check-designer-field-key-parity.mjs`'s, copied rather than reinvented.
 *
 * ## Both directions, because "is it declared?" is not the question
 *
 * MISSING   a control writes a name the oracle does not accept.
 * RETIRED   a control writes a name the oracle still LISTS but tombstones. ADR-0087
 *           D2 retirement replaces the member with `z.never()` rather than deleting
 *           it, so every declared-key check reads green while the parser refuses
 *           every value by name. `@object-ui/test-support`'s `isShapeKeyTombstoned`
 *           is the shared judge (objectui#3809 / objectui#4947).
 *
 * The REQUIRED direction — a schema-required key with no control — is measured
 * and reported on objectui#8216, and deliberately NOT gated here: objectui#7772's
 * triage records "an inspector need not expose every declared key" as a product
 * decision, and a gate over a product decision is a gate that gets waived.
 *
 * ## Ratchet, not bug report
 *
 * The first run over `main` surfaced three live offenders. Fixing them is not
 * this file's job and was out of scope on the card that built it — the same
 * position `check-designer-field-key-parity.mjs`'s header takes, and for the
 * same reason: the three take three DIFFERENT correct resolutions (one is
 * upstream in `@objectstack/spec`, one is a control rename plus two locale
 * tables, one is a `packages/types` mirror). Each is filed as its own card and
 * recorded in {@link LEDGER} with that card's number, and the ledger ratchets
 * BOTH ways — an unledgered violation is red, and a ledger row that no longer
 * applies is equally red, so a resolved key cannot leave an entry behind that
 * would silently re-admit the spelling later.
