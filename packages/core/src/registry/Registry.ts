 * That a component type is DEPRECATED for authoring — the machine-readable

 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * Before this type, a deprecation was stated in exactly two places, neither of
 * which any gate, test or type can consult: a `console.warn` STRING LITERAL
 * inside the renderer, and the word "(Deprecated)" inside a human-readable
 * `label`. So the question "is this type deprecated?" had no asker. The two
 * gates that touch component types — `examples/schema-catalog/test/
 * catalog-gallery-render.test.tsx` and `scripts/check-doc-component-types.mjs`
 * — both ask only whether a type RESOLVES, and a deprecated type resolves
 * perfectly well. The measurement objectui#6674 filed is what that costs: the
 * catalog suite passes 583/583 with 85 authored `div` nodes in the corpus. The
 * green was the finding.
 *
 * This is a layer BELOW the usual "declared but enforced nowhere" defect: there
 * was nothing declared to enforce.
 *
 * ## Why `surfaces` is required, and why a boolean would have been wrong
 *
 * `deprecated: true` would restate, as a contract, the exact falsehood the
 * maintainer ruled against on 2026-08-10 (objectui#4000): the `div` and `span`
 * notices are scoped BY PROVENANCE because those tags are deprecated on the
 * JSON surface and simultaneously PERMANENT, first-class vocabulary of the
 * `kind:'html'` tier — an author there writes the plain tag, our own parser
 * maps it straight through, and no other spelling exists for them to migrate
 * to. "A notice that says the type is deprecated FULL STOP is therefore false
 * for one of its two readers" (`div.tsx`), and the reader it was false for was
 * the one who could do nothing about it. A declaration that dropped the scope
 * would hand every future gate the same false premise, in a form that is harder
 * to see than a console string. So the scope travels WITH the declaration, and
 * {@link Registry.deprecationFor} makes callers name the surface they are
 * asking about instead of re-deriving the exemption locally.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * Nothing here fails a build, and nothing here deprecates anything: this is the
 * vocabulary plus the reader. Which types get marked, and when, is
 * objectui#3965's to decide — the ordering matters, because marking a type
 * while the corpus still authors it 85 times produces a red with nowhere to go.

   *

   *   associates its label the plain way: `<label for>` → the id the host handed
   *   down. This is the default and covers every single-control widget.
   * - `'group'` — it is NOT labelable: either a real composite (several inputs
   *   under one container, e.g. `address`) or a single control that is not a
   *   labelable element (a `div[role="button"]` dropzone, e.g. `file`). A
   *   `<label for>` pointing at such an element is inert in HTML — it activates
   *   nothing and contributes no accessible name (`HTMLLabelElement.control` is
   *   `null`) — so the host must instead give its label an `id` and hand the
   *   component `aria-labelledby`, which associates by IDREF and works on any
   *   element. The COMPONENT consumes those keys on its own surface.
   * - `'display'` — the rendered surface is a pure display in EVERY state:
   *   there is no focusable control and the component itself spreads nothing
   *   (computed / system-generated values such as `formula` / `summary` /
   *   `auto_number` / `vector`). The host must not emit a `<label for>` at all
   *   — no labelable element will ever exist for it to reach, in the editable
   *   state as much as the readonly one — and instead wraps the component's
   *   output in the host's own container carrying the field id,
   *   `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby` and `role="group"` (the
   *   objectui#4788 channel, driven by this declaration rather than by
   *   `readonly` alone). Unlike `'group'`, the WIDGET is not expected to
   *   consume anything: the host's wrapper is the named surface.
   *
   * This is a DECLARATION, not a guess: the host cannot infer it from the DOM a
   * widget happens to render, and a widget that fails to declare it falls back

 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * Both spellings were PUBLISHED — `@object-ui/types`' `src/index.ts` exports its
 * one, and this file reaches `@object-ui/core`'s public entry through
 * `src/index.ts`'s `export * from './registry/Registry.js'`. An IDE auto-import
 * therefore picked between two different types by alphabetical order. After
 * objectui#6067 / PR #6297 single-sourced the `ComponentMeta` half, what still
 * differed was GENERICITY AND THE `component` SLOT: `@object-ui/types`' was
 * non-generic with `component: any`, this one was `<T = any>` with
 * `component: ComponentRenderer<T>`.
 *
 * ⚠️ Measured on the EMITTED `.d.ts` of both packages immediately before this
 * convergence, `Exact<TypesConfig, CoreConfig>` — mutual assignability — read
 * `true` on the DIVERGED pair, because `component: any` absorbs everything and
 * every other member is optional. An assignability assertion is a GHOST here,
 * exactly as `__tests__/component-meta-derives-from-canonical.test.ts` records
 * for the sibling type. The readings that actually moved were "is
 * `@object-ui/types`' declaration generic" (`TS2315: Type 'ComponentConfig' is
 * not generic` before, no error after) and the symmetric key-set difference.
 *
 * A re-export is not a second authority — `scripts/__tests__/one-authority-per-exported-name-6273.test.ts`
 * counts declarations and ALIASING re-exports, never `export type { X } from …`
 * — which is why this convergence takes `ComponentConfig` off that gate's
 * `KNOWN_COLLISIONS` baseline. Deriving a new declaration here instead would
 * NOT have: `ComponentMeta` was converged that way by PR #6297 and is still a

 * ## The one place, and why it is this one
 *
 * The maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29 adopted option B **in the injection
 * form**: the declaration is emitted mechanically at the wrapping seam so every
 * gate-wrapping registration declares the key from the same place that reads it
 * — one mechanism rather than nine hand-kept copies across nine packages, which
 * drift and which a tenth block would simply forget. `register()` is where every
 * one of those registrations passes through, so it is where the emission lands;
 * the DECLARATION itself is `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT`, which lives beside the
 * binding's own semantics in `data-scope/element-data-source.ts`.
 *
 * ## What it must NOT do, which is half the ruling
 *
 * Widening this to every registration is option A wearing a different hat: it
 * would silence `dataSource` on `flex` and `card`, which do not read it, and the
 * diagnostic would lie in the other direction instead of the one it lied in
 * before. So the condition is the marker and nothing else — no heuristic over
 * `objectName`, no "looks object-bound".
 *
 * ## Idempotent, and it never overwrites
 *
 * A registration that declares `dataSource` ITSELF keeps its own entry: the
 * emission fills a gap, it does not own the key. (Nothing declares it today —
 * that is the defect — but a block whose binding needs a narrower description
 * later must be able to say so without fighting this function.) Re-registering
 * the same component, which the registry allows and tests do constantly, is
 * likewise a no-op rather than a growing `inputs` array.
 *
 * ## Typed end to end — the cast is gone (objectui#6950)
 *
 * The spliced element is an `InjectedComponentInput` (`@object-ui/types`): a
 * `ComponentInput` plus the framework-set `binding` marker, so it is a plain
 * subtype of the array's element type and the return value type-checks as a
 * `ComponentMeta` with no assertion. This used to read `as ComponentMeta`,
 * because `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT` carried a hand-written inline type and
 * `binding` had no declared home — and a cast at the one place the key is
 * written is exactly what would have hidden any later drift between the
 * constant and the type. The absence is held by `eslint.config.js`, which
 * scopes `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-assertions` with
 * `assertionStyle: 'never'` to THIS FILE (objectui#8316) — an AST rule,
 * because `tsc --noEmit` stays at exit 0 with the cast re-added and the
 * source-text pin that used to stand here was green for `<ComponentMeta>{…}`,
 * the same assertion in the other spelling.
 * `packages/types/src/__tests__/injected-component-input-6950.test.ts` still

   * and a deprecated type resolves.
   *
   * ## Why the caller must name a surface
   *
   * Because the honest answer differs by surface, and a reader that dropped the
   * distinction would let every caller re-derive it — which is how the same
   * exemption ends up written N times and wrong in N-1 of them. `div` is
   * deprecated for JSON-authored pages and is permanent vocabulary of the
   * `kind:'html'` tier (objectui#4000). Asking `deprecationFor('div', 'html')`
   * therefore correctly answers `undefined` even when the type declares a
   * `'json'` deprecation, and a gate over html-tier sources gets the right
   * answer without knowing the ruling.
   *
   * Returning the DECLARATION rather than a boolean is deliberate: the caller
   * that has to report the finding also needs `replacement` to say what to
   * author instead, and a boolean would send it back to the console string.
   *
   * Resolution is {@link getMeta}'s, so both spellings of a namespaced
   * registration answer alike (`div` and `ui:div`), a `skipFallback` type
   * answers only under its namespaced key, and a pending `registerLazy` stub
   * answers from the meta it was registered with.
