/**
 * objectui#6419 — the object schema GATES `ObjectView`'s non-grid record query.
 *
 * ## What this replaces
 *
 * The non-grid fetch effect built its expand set from a REF
 * (`objectSchemaRef.current`), assigned in the render body, and deliberately
 * omitted `objectSchema` from its dependency list. That bought exactly one
 * effect run per mount — and paid for it with the expansion, permanently: on
 * that one run the ref was still `null`, `buildExpandFields` saw no fields, and
 * the query went out as
 *
 *     ['task', { $top: 100 }]                       ← no `$expand`, ever
 *
 * `ObjectView` hands those rows to the child as `data={data}`, which suppresses
 * the child's own fetch, so every lookup / master_detail / user / tree field in
 * the six non-grid views it hosts (kanban, calendar, gallery, timeline, gantt,
 * map) rendered from raw foreign-key ids — blank on the kanban via
 * `isOpaqueId`, potentially the raw id on the other five.
 *
 * ## Why gating, and why the kanban's numbers did not decide it
 *
 * objectui#6271 settled the same trade for `ObjectKanban`, but this effect has
 * five more dependencies (`currentViewType`, `currentNamedViewConfig`,
 * `activeView`, `renderListView`, `refreshKey`), so what an extra re-run costs
 * HERE was measured separately. Instrumented adapter, `getObjectSchema` and
 * `find` both resolving in 30ms, four host regimes (bare, named `listViews`,
 * `views` prop, `views` prop with a re-rendering parent):
 *
 *   before             1 find, `{$top:100}`; `$expand` NEVER sent. Child gets
 *                      one delivery — raw rows.
 *   `objectSchema`     2 finds, `[{$top:100}, {$top:100,$expand:[…]}]`. Child
 *   added to the deps  gets TWO deliveries: `raw`, then `expanded`.
 *   gated (this file)  1 find, carrying `$expand` the first time. One
 *                      delivery — `expanded`.
 *
 * The middle row is where this component parts company with the board. On the
 * kanban the unexpanded first response was DISCARDED on arrival (`isMounted`
 * flipped false before it landed): a wasted round trip, no visible artefact.
 * Here the measured order is `schema:settled -> find:settled -> find:issued` —
 * the raw rows settle into `setData` BEFORE the re-run's cleanup, reach the
 * child, and paint. An extra re-run on THIS effect therefore costs a visible
 * two-step render (~40ms of blank-or-raw relation fields, then a swap), which
 * is precisely the "duplicate events in child views like the calendar" the
 * removed ref-comment cited. Gating avoids the wasted query AND the wrong
 * paint; correct rows land at the same wall clock either way (66.8–69.1ms
 * gated vs 68.3–69.3ms via the deps).
 *
 * ## ⚠️ What "gated" must mean — the trap this file exists to hold shut
 *
 * The gate is on the schema read having **settled**, NOT on `objectSchema`
 * being truthy. Those differ for exactly the views least able to report it: an
 * adapter exposing no `getObjectSchema`, and a read that throws. Under a
 * truthy-value gate both wait forever and the view renders empty, with no error
 * and no request — the third and fourth tests below go red the moment anyone
 * writes that.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Ghost-assertion guard
 *
 * A query count, or an `$expand` presence check, would ALSO pass if this view
 * stopped fetching altogether. So: every count here is reached only after
 * waiting for a real call; the first test's `waitFor` targets the EXPANDED call
 * specifically, so zero fetches times out rather than reading as success; one
 * test asserts rows actually reach the child; and `$expand` is asserted against
 * the expandable fields DERIVED FROM THE FIXTURE SCHEMA, never a bare
 * `toBeDefined()`.
