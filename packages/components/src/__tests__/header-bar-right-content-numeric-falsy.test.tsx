/**
 * `ui:header-bar`'s `rightContent` slot no longer leaks a stray `"0"`
 * (objectui#9033) — the numeric-falsy JSX trap objectui#8331 measured and
 * closed one slot over on `DataTableSchema.emptyAction`.
 *
 * ## The mechanism, and why it is not objectui#8908
 *
 * `HeaderBarSchema.rightContent` is declared `SchemaNode` on BOTH published
 * faces — the interface in `@object-ui/types`, and its zod mirror, whose node
 * union carries a `z.number()` arm — so `0` is an authorable value for it.
 * `theValidatorAcceptsZero` below asserts that from the published validator
 * rather than asserting it in prose, because every row here is worthless if
 * the value is unreachable.
 *
 * The renderer guarded the slot with an `&&` chain whose left operand is the
 * raw slot value. With `rightContent: 0` that chain evaluates to the NUMBER
 * `0`, and React renders numbers — so the header painted a stray `"0"`.
 *
 * objectui#8908 repaired `toRenderableSchema` so a falsy primitive becomes
 * nothing rather than its `String` form. That repair does ⛔ NOT reach this
 * line and never could: `&&` short-circuits, so the bridge is not called at
 * all for a falsy value — the chain has already produced the raw `0` before
 * any bridge runs. Same symptom from the user's seat, different mechanism,
 * different fix. `theBridgeIsNotWhatFixesThis` pins that distinction directly
 * so a future reader cannot conclude the bridge covers this slot.
 *
 * ## Why `false` and `''` are present but are ⛔ NOT evidence
 *
 * React ignores `false` as a child, and `''` contributes no characters. Both
 * rows were GREEN before the repair and are green after it, so neither can
 * discriminate the two worlds. They sit in `rowsThatCannotDiscriminate` under
 * that name, kept only so a later reader does not "extend coverage" by adding
 * them as if they proved something.
 *
 * The rows that DO discriminate are the falsy NUMBERS, and only they:
 * `0` and `-0` (both of which React prints as the single character `0`) and
 * `NaN` (which prints the three characters `NaN`).
 *
 * ## Why the assertions read whole text rather than query for a node
 *
 * The leak is a bare text node with no element of its own — there is nothing
 * to `querySelector`. The instrument is therefore the header's entire
 * `textContent`, compared against the baseline the same harness produces for
 * `rightContent: undefined`. `theInstrumentSeesSlotText` is the lit control on
 * that instrument: with `rightContent: 42` the text MUST grow by `42`, so a
 * "no stray characters" row cannot pass because the instrument went blind.
 *
 * ## The `SidebarProvider` host
 *
 * `header-bar` renders `SidebarTrigger`, which calls `useSidebar()` and THROWS
 * without a provider. A caught throw renders markup that reads as a clean pass
 * for every row below, so `theHarnessRendersTheRealHeader` asserts the real
 * header is mounted rather than assuming it.
