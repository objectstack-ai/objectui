# exits 254 on an unknown script -- but that call sat inside an `if`, and an
# `if` condition suppresses `set -e`, so the miss took the else branch and
# printed "Some tests failed, but setup is complete". The "run tests" step was
# a no-op that reported it had run (objectui#7987). A step that cannot run
# while reporting that it did is worse than one that fails: the contributor who
# reads the warning believes the suite exists and is partly broken, the one who
# does not believes it passed, and nothing distinguishes the two.

# Reading the name back out of the manifest is the same discipline the Node
# floor above follows (objectui#5306): the script and the manifest cannot drift

# fields, layout): a hand-maintained copy of a dependency graph turbo already
# owns, and it had drifted from it. `@object-ui/react` depends on
# `@object-ui/i18n` and `@object-ui/data-objectstack`, neither of which was on
# the list, so on a CLEAN checkout the third step died with

# class objectui#7292 measured on `packages/components/package.json`'s
# `prebuild`). A hand-written order cannot be kept correct by review, because
