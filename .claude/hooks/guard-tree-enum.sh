# guard-tree-enum.sh — PreToolUse guard: the `origin/main` reading rule covers file
# CONTENTS but not file ENUMERATION. Blocks a Bash command that takes its file LIST from
# the working tree and its file CONTENTS from `origin/main`, and lets either half alone —
# and the `git ls-tree origin/main` enumeration — straight through.
#
# Why: this repo's instructions say "核验 main 用 `origin/main`" — read contents with
# `git show origin/main:<path>` or `git grep … origin/main`, never from the shared working
# tree whose HEAD other agents switch under you. That rule is about READS. A sweep can obey
# it perfectly and still be wrong, because the FILE LIST is a second, unruled source:
#
#   for f in .github/workflows/*.yml; do          # ← list from the WORKING TREE
#     git show "origin/main:$f" | grep -q PATTERN # ← contents from origin/main
#   done
#
# Every file it opens is read correctly. Files that exist on `origin/main` but not at the
# working tree's current HEAD are never iterated at all, so the loop cannot report them and
# cannot know it missed them. The output is a zero that looks like a full-tree scan.
#
# Live incident, THIS repository (2026-08-29), filed as objectstack#13305: a seat ran exactly
# the loop above to decide whether flipping a batch of draft PRs to ready would trigger any CI.
# Measured that day — working tree `ls .github/workflows/*.yml | wc -l` = 30;
# `git ls-tree --name-only origin/main .github/workflows/ | grep -c '\.yml$'` = 31. The one
# missing file was `.github/workflows/governed-surface-guard.yml`, whose line 36 declares
# `types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]` — that is, the answer to the
# exact question being asked was the file left out of the enumeration. Acting on the wrong
# reading, the seat flipped 10 PRs to ready; each fired a fresh guard run and went from
# `mergeable_state: clean` to `unstable`, during an ongoing runner-capacity outage.
#
# ⚠️ Why the existing zero-hit discipline did not catch it — the transferable part, and the
# reason this is a hook rather than a paragraph. The discipline says a zero is only a
# reading if a control term that MUST hit is run in the same query and does. One was run:
# `pull_request` matched 5 workflow files, so the method demonstrably worked. But those 5
# files came from the SAME faulty list, so the control validated the MATCHER and said
# nothing about the ENUMERATION. Grading of objectstack#13305, verbatim and untranslated:
#
#   「一个对照必须有能力因为你担心的那个原因而失败;同源对照结构上做不到。」
#
# ⇒ when a sweep's POPULATION and its per-item READ come from different sources, the
# control has to be drawn from the population source, not the read source.
#
# The canonical fix, mirroring how `git show origin/main:` is already the canonical way to
# read contents — enumerate from the same ref you read from:
#
#   git ls-tree --name-only origin/main <dir>
#
# A command that enumerates that way is never blocked here, however it then reads.
#
# What is detected, and only when BOTH appear in ONE command — either alone is fine and is
# allowed, because either alone is correct in ordinary use:
#   (a) a WORKING-TREE enumeration — `for NAME in <glob>`, `ls <glob>`, `find <path>`
#   (b) an `origin/…` CONTENT read — `git show origin/…:<path>`, `git grep … origin/…`,
#       `git cat-file … origin/…:<path>`
# Suppressed whenever the same command also runs `git ls-tree … origin/…`: that is the
# recommended population/read cross-check, and it must not be harder to write than the bug.
#
# Deliberate exception (the working tree really is the population you mean — e.g. you are
# asking what YOUR branch changed): OS_ALLOW_TREE_ENUM=1.
#
# Exit-code contract, mirroring guard-shared-stash.sh and guard-main-checkout.sh:
# 0 = allow, 2 = block with the reason on stderr. Anything this cannot parse fails OPEN —
# a guard that blocks work it does not understand gets disabled, and then it guards nothing.
# The rule outranks the hook, not the other way round.
#
# Known boundaries, stated so nobody has to rediscover them:
#   - Classification reads the FIRST WORD of each shell segment, so a wrapped invocation
#     (`bash -c '…'`, `xargs`, `ssh host '…'`) is not caught. Same deliberate trade the
#     stash guard documents: the target is the reflexive sweep an agent writes mid-task,
#     not a determined evader, and OS_ALLOW_TREE_ENUM=1 exists for anyone who means it.
#   - Split across two Bash calls (glob into a variable in one, read it in the next) is out
#     of reach by construction — a PreToolUse hook sees one command at a time.
#   - Writing ABOUT the defect is never caught: `grep -n 'git show origin/main:' AGENTS.md`
#     has head word `grep`, so it is neither (a) nor (b). The PR that writes a rule must not
#     trip the rule it writes.
#
# Mirrored from objectstack's hook of the same name (objectstack#13305), the same discipline
# guard-shared-stash.sh and guard-main-checkout-bash.sh already document: the verdict logic
# below is kept case-for-case identical to objectstack's so the two repos' guards cannot
# drift; only the incident's framing and the self-test's example paths are localised. The
# measured incident is THIS repository's, so it reads in the first person here.

⛔ Blocked: this command takes its file LIST from the working tree and its file CONTENTS
   from origin/main. The result is a zero that looks like a full-tree scan.
   enumeration: $enum_example
   read:        $read_example

The origin/main reading rule covers CONTENTS. It does not cover ENUMERATION. Files that
exist on origin/main but not at this checkout's current HEAD are never iterated, so the
loop cannot report them and cannot know it missed them — every file it does open is read
perfectly correctly, which is what makes the output so convincing.

Measured HERE, 2026-08-29 (objectstack#13305): working tree 30 workflow files,
origin/main 31. The missing one was .github/workflows/governed-surface-guard.yml, which
declares ready_for_review — the answer to the very question being asked. 10 PRs were
flipped to ready on that reading, during a runner-capacity outage.

⚠️ A zero-hit control does NOT cover this. One was run at the time and passed, because it
was drawn from the same faulty file list: it validated the MATCHER, not the ENUMERATION.
「一个对照必须有能力因为你担心的那个原因而失败;同源对照结构上做不到。」

Enumerate from the ref you are reading from:
  git ls-tree --name-only origin/main <dir>
  git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main <dir>      # recursive

  # the population/read cross-check, before trusting any zero:
  git ls-tree --name-only origin/main <dir> | wc -l
  ls <dir>/* | wc -l                                # differ? the working tree is not the population

A command that enumerates with git ls-tree is never blocked here, however it then reads.
Either half alone is fine too — this fires only on the two together.

Deliberate exception (the working tree really is the population you mean — e.g. asking
what YOUR branch changed): set OS_ALLOW_TREE_ENUM=1 in the
environment this hook itself runs in — a local settings "env" entry, or whatever this
agent process was started with. A VAR=1 prefix on a command sets it for that command
only, and this hook is not that command, so a prefix never reaches it.
