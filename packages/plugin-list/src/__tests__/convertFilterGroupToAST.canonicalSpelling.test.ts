/**
 * `convertFilterGroupToAST` reads the operator through the same fold the rest
 * of the predicate already uses, so ONE value-less operator emits ONE node
 * whichever spelling the stored row carries (objectui#9359).
 *
 * ## The defect, in one sentence
 *
 * The two halves of one predicate spoke different vocabularies. The value-less
 * short-circuit did a raw `has()` against `VALUELESS_FILTER_BUILDER_OPERATORS`
 * — six camelCase dropdown ids — while the completeness test it falls through
 * to (`isFilterValueComplete`) DOES fold, through the spec's
 * `normalizeFilterOperator`, to decide arity. So a row spelled `is_null` — the
 * spec's canonical form, which is exactly what `foldFilterGroupToSpecRules`
 * persists into a saved view — missed the short-circuit, landed on `scalar`,
 * had its `value: ''` read as an unfinished row, and was DROPPED. The function
 * then returned `[]`: no filter at all. The live grid returned every record
 * while the panel showed a filter applied. Nothing errored.
 *
 * This is the same failure the exported set was created to prevent, recorded
 * verbatim in its own docblock — *"the live-grid copy listed only
 * `isEmpty`/`isNotEmpty` … the grid read that as an unfinished row, dropped it,
 * and applied NO filter at all while the panel showed one. Silent, and every
 * record came back."* objectui#4744 repaired it for the dropdown's spellings
 * and left the canonical ones on the old path.
 *
 * ## What the repair deliberately does NOT do (the ruling on objectui#9302,
 * which this card is covered by)
 *
 *   - ⛔ the EXPORTED set is not widened. Its stated job is *which rows the
 *     builder leaves value-less* — a fact about that dropdown's own six ids —
 *     and `app-shell`'s `foldFilterGroupToSpecRules` documents its own
 *     `VALUELESS_FILTER_OPERATORS` as that set PLUS the canonical spellings
 *     only that layer sees. Widening the export would make another layer's
 *     deliberate compensation redundant by SIDE EFFECT, in a file nobody is
 *     editing. Pinned below, and pinned identically by the sibling repair in
 *     `packages/components`.
 *   - ⛔ no row's stored `operator` is rewritten. This function converts; it
 *     does not migrate.
 *   - ⛔ no second spelling joins the toolbar's dropdown.
 *
 * ⛔ Out of scope and untouched: WHICH operator vocabulary wins (decision card
 * objectui#9306). This is a defect at one reader regardless of how that lands.
 *
 * ⛔ And the fold does not cross the `contains` / `icontains` boundary —
 * objectui#7379 holds that is "a semantic boundary, not two spellings of one
 * thing", and `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATOR_ALIASES` has no row for either. Pinned by
 * the boundary guard at the bottom.
 *
 * ## DIRECTION, predicted before the first run
 *
 * On the unmodified tree the four CANONICAL rows (`is_null`, `is_not_null`,
 * `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`) are RED — each emits `[]` where a real node is
 * required. Everything else is GREEN in both directions and is carried for a
 * named reason rather than for coverage:
 *
 *   - the six DROPDOWN ids emit their node today and must keep emitting the
 *     SAME node — the over-reach guard. A repair that folded only one
 *     direction, or that replaced the set's members with canonical spellings,
 *     moves these;
 *   - `equals` with a value is the FIRING CONTROL, in the same run. Without it
 *     "every row emits something" and "the converter is dead" read alike;
 *   - `exists` / `notExists` have no canonical twin — the spec's vocabulary has
 *     no existence operator and its alias table deliberately has no row for
 *     one — so the fold returns them verbatim. They pin that routing the
 *     lookup through a fold did not drop the two members with nothing to fold
 *     to. (They are `OPT_IN_OPERATORS` and this toolbar offers neither; the
 *     emission is unreachable in the product and pinned here so a future
 *     decision to offer them lands as a red test, exactly as
 *     `convertFilterGroupToAST.test.ts` already pins it.)
 *
 * ## After objectui#9306
 *
 * The builder's ids — and so the exported set's members — are the canonical
 * spellings now, and its former camelCase ids are the deprecated alias form a
 * stored filter (or a per-user cached panel group) may still carry. This
 * reader is unchanged: it folds before the lookup, so the table reads the same
 * nodes. Only the roles swapped — the canonical rows are the dropdown's own
 * ids, and the camelCase rows are the spellings that reach the set only
 * through the fold, i.e. the firing cases. The rows are relabelled to say so.
