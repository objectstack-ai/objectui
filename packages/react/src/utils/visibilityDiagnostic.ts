 * Diagnostic: a node-gate predicate could not be evaluated (objectui#5454,
 * leg 3 of the 2026-08-21 ruling; production coverage added by objectui#6038,
 * maintainer ruling 2026-08-25 option B; the `disabled` / `disabledOn` gate
 * added by objectui#6445).
 *
 * ## The defect this names
 *
 * `SchemaRenderer`'s visibility chain is FAIL-SOFT: `evaluateCondition` answers
 * an unevaluable predicate with `true`. On the four negated legs (`visible` /
 * `visibleWhen` / `visibleOn` / `visibility`) that `true` means SHOWN — so "this
 * predicate is broken" and "this predicate said yes" reach the screen as the
 * same pixel. An author who mistyped a root, or who wrote a `record.*` gate
 * before objectui#5454 bound the row, saw their block render and had no signal
 * at all that the gate had not been consulted.
 *
 * One of the three evaluation paths was already loud — a `{ dialect: 'cel' }`
 * envelope routes to `evalFieldPredicate`, which warns (objectstack#5149). The
 * bare-expression and `${…}` template paths were mute. So whether an author
 * heard about their own typo depended on which dialect they happened to write
 * it in, which is the arbitrariness this module removes.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It changes NO verdict. `evaluateCondition` already returned `true` for every
 * unevaluable predicate on every one of its paths, and the caller reproduces
 * exactly that from its catch — including on the two NON-negated legs
 * (`hidden` / `hiddenOn`), where the same `true` means HIDE — and, since
 * objectui#6445, on the `disabled` / `disabledOn` gate, where it means GREYED
 * OUT. Flipping fail-soft to fail-closed is a shipped-behaviour change tracked
 * separately upstream (objectstack#5149, appeal 1, undecided); this module is
 * the diagnostic half only, on every gate wired to it.
 *
 * ## Why a separate module
 *
 * Same reason as `unevaluatedExpression.ts` next door: exporting non-components
 * from the module that exports `SchemaRenderer` breaks Fast Refresh
 * (`react-refresh/only-export-components`), and a format/emit split lets the
 * pins assert the words a developer will actually read rather than that a spy
 * was called — a diagnostic whose only test is the latter goes green the moment
 * someone no-ops it.

/**
 * Which SCOPE the faulting predicate was evaluated against (objectui#6487).
 *
 * ## Why the reporter needs to be told, rather than deducing it
 *
 * The closing paragraph of the message names the ROOTS an author can bind. That
 * is the half of the report an author acts on: a fault is usually a mistyped or
 * unbound root, and "which roots exist here" is the answer. It is therefore the
 * one part of the copy that is NOT true on every surface — the callers below
 * build genuinely different bags — and it was printed unconditionally in the
 * node tier's spelling, so an app-shell author was sent to check `record` and
 * `page.<var>`, which nothing at that tier binds.
 *
 * The alternative fix — generalising the copy to "whatever this surface binds"
 * plus a docs link — was refused deliberately: the concrete root names are the
 * whole value of the paragraph, and advice that names no roots is correct
 * everywhere and useful nowhere.
 *
 * Deducing the tier from the `type` slot was refused too. `type` carries the
 * SCHEMA NODE TYPE at the node tier and a surface label at the other two
 * (`page:tabs`, `app-shell:visible`), and `page:tabs` is a real registry key —
 * so a `page:tabs` NODE faulting its own `visibleWhen` inside `SchemaRenderer`
 * is indistinguishable, by `type` alone, from one of its ITEM predicates. An
 * explicit argument cannot collide that way.
 *
 * ## The tiers, each derived from the code that builds the bag
 *
 * `'page-component'` — the node gate. `SchemaRenderer.tsx` builds
 * `new ExpressionEvaluator({ ...predicateScope, current_user, [record], data,
 * page })`, so the roots the SPEC declares for the tier (`ui/page.zod.ts`:
 * *"Binds `record`, `current_user`, `page.<var>`"*) are the roots it binds.
 * `page:tabs` ITEM predicates (`containers.tsx`) are this tier as well: they
 * build the same three roots (plus the row spread flat, and `data` aliased to
 * the row rather than to the adapter — both undeclared breadth that the spec
 * does not promise and this paragraph therefore does not advertise).
 *
 * `'app-shell'` — the chrome gate. `ExpressionProvider.tsx` builds
 * `{ current_user, user, ctx: { user }, os: { user }, features }`.
 * There is no `record` and no `page` in it at all, which is the defect this
 * type exists to fix. The four identity spellings are the ADR-0068 aliases and
 * all four resolve; `features` is the deployment-flag root that provider's own
 * docblock documents for exactly this kind of predicate.
 *
 * ⛔ No `app`. It was in that bag and in the paragraph below until
 * objectui#8155 (ruled 2026-09-07): neither ADR-0068 nor
 * `@objectstack/formula`'s `SCOPE_ROOTS` declares such a root, so
 * `buildExpressionScope` stopped binding it. Naming it here would be worse
 * than stale — this paragraph is printed at the exact moment a saved `app.*`
 * predicate faults, so it would answer "why did my predicate not resolve?"
 * with the root that is the reason.
 *
 * ⛔ No `data` either, since objectui#8166 (ruled 2026-09-10). It WAS bound at
 * the app-shell tier and was already withheld from the paragraph below, on the
 * grounds that every `ExpressionProvider` mount passes `data={{}}` — but
 * `AppContent`'s own field-list evaluator passed the record under edit, so on
 * that one leg an authored `data.*` resolved silently against the host's record
 * instead of faulting. `buildExpressionScope` stopped binding it; a `data.*`
 * predicate at this tier now reaches this reporter with the engine's
 * `Unknown variable: data`, the same verdict the server gives it.

/**
 * WHICH GATE the faulting predicate was authored on (objectui#6445).
 *
 * ## Why the reporter has to be told, when it already prints the key
 *
 * `evaluateCondition` answers an unevaluable predicate with `true` on every one
 * of its paths, and every caller reproduces that answer. What that `true` DOES
 * to the node is not a property of the predicate - it is a property of the gate
 * it was authored on, and the consequence paragraph has to say which:
 *
 * `'visibility'` - the visibility chain. Its `true` means SHOWN on the four
 * negated legs, so the safe default does NOT bite: a predicate that could not be
 * evaluated reads on screen exactly like one that said yes, which is why the
 * console line is the only signal an author gets.
 *
 * `'enablement'` - `disabled` / `disabledOn`. The SAME `true` GREYS THE CONTROL
 * OUT, so here the safe default is the one that BITES. The author is looking at
 * a control they can see and cannot use; telling them the gate did not bite
 * would be the opposite of what is on their screen, and would send them looking
 * for a rendering bug rather than at their own predicate.
 *
 * ## Why a parameter, and not deduced from `key`
 *
 * Same reason {@link PredicateScopeTier} is a parameter (read its docblock): the
 * caller knows, and a deduction is a table that goes quietly wrong the moment a
 * spelling arrives that it has not heard of - a new alias, or a caller outside
 * this repo - which would inherit a consequence sentence written about some
 * other gate. That is the exact defect class this card and objectui#6487 both
 * exist to remove, so it is not worth re-introducing to save an argument.
 *
 * `'concealment'` - `hidden` / `hiddenOn` (objectui#6503). These are visibility
 * legs, but the only two whose verdict `SchemaRenderer` does NOT negate, so the
 * SAME `true` that SHOWS a node on the four negated legs REMOVES it here. They
 * resolved to `'visibility'` until objectui#6503 and were therefore handed the
 * one sentence that is false about them: the gate did not merely bite, it bit
 * hardest of the three, and the node is not on screen to be inspected at all.
 * This is the third member objectui#6445's docblock predicted, in the shape it
 * predicted - a table entry and a routing decision, no signature change.
 *
 * ## Why a third MEMBER, and not `'visibility'` plus a `negated` flag
 *
 * What varies is the consequence sentence, and it varies per GATE - not along
 * an independent axis a caller could set to contradict the gate it passed
 * alongside. Three flat members cannot be spelled inconsistently; a
 * `(kind, negated)` pair can, and `('enablement', negated: true)` would name a
 * combination no renderer in this repo produces. The table stays the one place
 * that decides what a fail-soft default DID.
 *
 * ## What widening this union costs, stated because it is a published surface
 *
 * `PredicateGateKind` is re-exported from `packages/react/src/index.ts` - the
 * package entry, and the chain stops there (no sibling package re-exports it,
 * and no file outside `packages/react` names it). A consumer switching
 * EXHAUSTIVELY over the union, or holding a `Record<PredicateGateKind, ...>`,
 * gains a third case to answer. That is a type-level change only: no runtime
 * signature moved, and every value that was accepted before still is.

 *
 * The visibility chain was the first gate wired to it and is still the default
 * {@link PredicateGateKind}; `disabled` / `disabledOn` joined it in
 * objectui#6445, which is why the name is now narrower than the function. It is
 * kept anyway: this symbol is exported from the package entry and called from
 * `@object-ui/app-shell` and `@object-ui/components`, so renaming it would be a
 * cross-package edit that changes no behaviour, on a card scoped to one file's
 * wiring. What has to stay true is the posture the name once described — ONE
 * reporter, ONE dedupe `Set`, ONE severity, ONE reset — and a second reporter
 * for the second gate is exactly what that rules out.
 *
 * `console.warn`, not `error`: the verdict is unchanged and the page still
 * renders, so this is a diagnostic about a predicate — not the refusal
 * `reportUnevaluatedExpressions` emits once raw source has reached the DOM.
 *
 * ## `err` takes a reason, not only an `Error`
 *
 * The dev caller catches a throw and passes the `Error`; the production caller
 * is handed the evaluator's own reason STRING through `EvaluationOptions.onFault`
 * (no throw is raised there, because raising one would cost a second
 * evaluation). `String(err)` already covered that shape, so both callers reach
 * the same `Reason:` text and the same dedupe entry — which is what makes "dev
 * and production print the identical line" true rather than approximately true.
 *
 * ## `tier` is NOT in the dedupe key, and that is not an oversight
 *
 * The key stays `(type, key, predicate source)` — the rate limit objectui#6038
 * pinned in both directions. Adding `tier` could only ever LOOSEN it, and it
 * would take a `type` shared across two tiers to loosen anything: the app-shell
 * site's `type` is the constant `'app-shell:visible'`, which no node tier can
 * produce, and the two `'page-component'` callers are the same tier by
 * definition. So the tier is free of the key by measurement, not by assumption.
 *
 * ## Neither is `gate`, and for a stronger reason (objectui#6445)
 *
 * `gate` is a FUNCTION of `key`, which is already in the dedupe key: the
 * enablement gate is exactly `disabled` / `disabledOn` and the visibility gate
 * is exactly the six legs of the visibility chain, two disjoint sets. So adding
 * it could not separate two entries that `key` does not already separate, and
 * the cross-gate direction is pinned rather than argued: the SAME predicate
 * source authored on `disabled` and on `visibleWhen` produces TWO lines, not
 * one - the new reporting site cannot be swallowed by a visibility entry, and
 * cannot swallow one.

/**
 * The `data.*` reads in `source` that are `undefined` on the object `data` is
 * actually bound to — i.e. the ones that make the comparison a constant.
 *
 * ## Why THIS discriminator, measured against the three alternatives
 *
 * The ruling's trigger is not "references `data.`" — a genuine adapter read has
 * to stay silent, and that half is what makes the loud half mean anything.
 * Measured on `packages/core`'s built evaluator, against the four candidate
 * definitions:
 *
 *   * "references `data.` at all" — fires on `data.total > 0` against an
 *     adapter that HAS `total`. Refused by the ruling in as many words.
 *   * "the whole predicate is constant-false" — measured: `data.total > 100`
 *     against `{ total: 99 }` returns `false`, and so does a correct
 *     `record.status == 'draft'` against a row whose status is `open`. The
 *     definition cannot tell a gate that correctly says NO from a gate that
 *     never asked. It would report every hiding gate in the repo.
 *   * "the comparison OPERAND is undefined" — the most precise reading, and it
 *     needs the expression engine to expose its operands. That is a change to
 *     `@object-ui/core`'s evaluator for a diagnostic on a card that dissolves
 *     when objectui#5330's deprecation window closes — BOTH legs together,
 *     the enablement one objectui#6504 added included; see
 *     {@link ADAPTER_ONLY_GATE_COPY}'s binding inheritance clause.
 *   * "a `data.*` read the bound object does not answer" — this one. On the
 *     card's repro (`data.status` against the adapter) it fires; on
 *     `${data.total}` against `{ total: 99 }` it does not; and it is
 *     STRUCTURALLY incapable of firing on the `record.*` bucket (objectui#5401
 *     → #5454), which is the adjacent card with a different correct fix.
 *
 * Residue, stated rather than hidden: deliberate absence idioms
 * (`data.status == null`, `!data.status`) are reported. They are not really
 * false positives at this tier — an adapter that has no `status` makes those
 * constants too, just constant-TRUE instead of constant-false — but they are
 * the shapes an author could have meant.
 *
 * The walk mirrors `useDataScope`'s own `path.split('.').reduce(…)` resolution
 * of a path, so "undefined here" means what it means everywhere else this repo
 * resolves a path against a scope.
 *
 * ⭐ WHAT `boundData` IS, since objectui#9308. It used to be the injected
 * ADAPTER (`SchemaRendererContext.dataSource`), because the renderer bound that
 * object as the `data` root. It no longer binds one: `boundData` is now the
 * `data` the HOST published in the ambient predicate scope, i.e. the exact
 * object the evaluator resolved `data.*` against. Passing the adapter after
 * that ruling would have inverted this diagnostic — silent for the hosts whose
 * predicates actually broke (their bag still answers), and loud for hosts whose
 * scope-channel `data` answers perfectly.
 *
 * ⚠️ Reachability, stated rather than assumed: when the host publishes NO
 * `data` root, a `data.*` predicate does not evaluate cleanly at all — it
 * throws `data is not defined`, which is objectui#5454's leg, reported by
 * {@link reportUnresolvableVisibilityPredicate} with a message that is true for
 * it. Both call sites of this function sit on the NON-throwing branch, so this
 * leg is reached only for a host that published a `data` root which does not
 * answer the read. That is the population it can still speak for, and the one
 * it now speaks about accurately.

/**
 * Dev-build diagnostic for a node-gate predicate that reads `data.*` and gets
 * `undefined` back from the adapter (objectui#5687, maintainer ruling
 * 2026-08-22 option A).
 *
 * ## It changes NO verdict, and it is not allowed to
 *
 * The ruling is explicit that the node tier keeps its documented
 * `data` = adapter semantics: no verdict change, no interpolation change. This
 * function returns `void`, is called for its console output only, and the
 * caller passes the evaluator's answer through untouched. The constant-false
 * still hides the block; the author now hears about it.
 *
 * ## Why it lives beside `reportUnresolvableVisibilityPredicate`
 *
 * They are two halves of ONE silence. objectui#5454 made the THROWING paths
 * loud; measured on this base, a `{ dialect: 'cel' }` envelope reading
 * `data.status` already throws and is already reported by that function. The
 * bare-string and `${…}` template dialects do not throw for the same
 * predicate — they resolve `undefined == 'draft'` to a clean `false` — so the
 * author heard about the identical authoring mistake only if they happened to
 * write it in the CEL dialect. That is the same dialect-dependent arbitrariness
 * objectui#5454 existed to remove, one path further along.
 *
 * Sharing the module means sharing the LIFECYCLE, which is the part that has to
 * match: one dedupe Set, one reset, one severity. (One gate, too, until
 * objectui#6038 — see the prefix constant above for why only the sibling leg
 * crossed into production.) The dedupe
 * key is tagged with this leg's name so the two diagnostics cannot silence each
 * other for the same (type, key, source) triple — they are different faults,
 * and a node that faults one way is not evidence about the other.
 *
 * ## `gate` (objectui#6504) — NOT in the dedupe key, for the reason
 * {@link reportUnresolvableVisibilityPredicate}'s own docblock gives for the
 * same omission
 *
 * `gate` is a FUNCTION of `key`: the enablement gate is exactly `disabled` /
 * `disabledOn` and the visibility gate this leg is called for is the six-leg
 * chain, two disjoint sets. Adding it to the dedupe key could not separate two
 * entries `key` does not already separate — and the cross-gate direction is
 * the one that would matter if it could: the SAME predicate source authored on
 * `disabled` and on (say) `visibleWhen` must produce TWO lines, which it does
 * today because `key` differs, with or without `gate` in the tuple.
 *
 * Defaults to `'visibility'` — the objectui#5687 call site
 * (`evaluateVisibilityPredicate`) is unchanged by this card and still calls
 * this function with five arguments.
