/**
 * `element:number.filter` — the MEMBER SHAPE this metric reads (objectui#8071).
 *
 * The member pin for this key. Unlike the other keys this card has pinned,
 * `filter` carries no NAMED member set of its own: it is a query predicate
 * `ElementNumberRenderer` (`renderers/basic/elements.tsx`) never inspects. So
 * the member shape here is the SPELLING it arrives under downstream, and the
 * renderer uses TWO different ones on its two paths:
 *
 *   - `adapter.aggregate(object, { field, function, groupBy: '_all', filter })`
 *     — flat, under its own name, beside the three keys that make the call an
 *     aggregate at all.
 *   - `adapter.find(object, { $filter: filter })` — the fallback when the
 *     adapter carries no `aggregate()`, WRAPPED under `$filter`.
 *
 * One authored key, two wire spellings, chosen by a capability check the author
 * cannot see. That is precisely the kind of thing that gets "tidied" into one
 * spelling, and either direction silently drops the predicate: a metric that
 * should read "open opportunities" then counts EVERY row and paints a
 * confidently wrong number. No diagnostic, no empty state — the failure mode
 * this whole direction (objectui#8068) exists to make loud.
 *
 * The third member semantic is the re-query rule. The effect keys on
 * `JSON.stringify(props.filter)`, not on the object identity:
 *
 *     const filterKey = React.useMemo(
 *       () => (props.filter ? JSON.stringify(props.filter) : ''), [props.filter]);
 *
 * so the predicate is read BY VALUE. A parent that rebuilds an equal filter
 * literal every render must NOT re-probe the server, and a parent that changes
 * one comparand MUST. Both arms are asserted, because a dependency array
 * "simplified" to `props.filter` passes the second and turns the first into a
 * per-render fetch storm.
 *
 * ## Nothing pre-existing covered this
 *
 * Measured before writing: exactly two test files name `element:number` and
 * touch this area, and neither can be credited.
 * `element-number.contractEnvelope-6726.test.tsx` (read end to end) drives the
 * SAME `find()` fallback branch but authors no `filter` at all — the word does
 * not occur in it, so the locator itself would refuse it ("pin file never names
 * the key"). `data-objectstack`'s `aggregate-filter-lowering.test.ts` mentions
 * `element:number` once, in a comment, and tests the adapter's own lowering
 * below this seam rather than what the renderer hands it.
