/**
 * objectui#8875 clause 2 — the DIFFERENTIAL cross-file line-address citation
 * gate.
 *
 * The maintainer ruled the class on 2026-09-10, verbatim and untranslated:
 * 跨文件的「某文件第几行」引用， 这种完全没必要吧，是否应该避免. The mechanism
 * half is a gate that reds on what a pull request ADDS, and the load-bearing
 * word is DIFFERENTIAL — an absolute count was refused on a measurement, not a
 * preference: PR #8887's line shifts flipped one citation from `drifted` to
 * `resolves` by accident and moved the tree-wide false count 540 -> 539, an
 * unearned green a total-reading gate would have scored as progress.
 *
 * ⛔ THE ONE THING THESE TESTS EXIST TO STOP is a gate that cannot fail. A
 * differential gate reporting zero because its differ is broken is
 * indistinguishable from a clean branch — which is this card's own subject one
 * level up. So the firing direction is asserted first, and every non-firing
 * assertion below is paired with a firing one on the same code path.
