/**
 * Dev-build diagnostic: a `props` CONFIG BAG on a node whose renderer reads its
 * config from `schema` — so the keys inside it are evaluated, spread as React
 * props, and then never read (objectui#6708).
 *
 * ## The defect this names
 *
 * `SchemaRenderer` HOISTS every `properties.*` value onto the node (minus
 * `HOIST_PROTECTED_KEYS`), so a key written under `properties` is a real value
 * on `schema.<key>` by the time a renderer destructures it. `props` is NOT
 * hoisted: it is spread as React props on the created element. A renderer
 * declared as `({ schema })` — the normal shape for the component renderers —
 * therefore never sees it.
 *
 * Measured through the real `SchemaRenderer` on `faac0d935`, one node per row,
 * with a probe renderer that records both channels:
 *
 *   { type: 'test:cap', props:      { data: '${data.customers}' } }
 *       -> React prop `data` = the evaluated array, `schema.data` = undefined
 *   { type: 'test:cap', properties: { data: '${data.customers}' } }
 *       -> React prop `data` = the evaluated array, `schema.data` = the array
 *
 * Same key, same value, one envelope apart. The card's own four-leg reading of
 * the same asymmetry through a real `data-table` is pinned in
 * `packages/components/src/__tests__/data-table-node-data-diagnostic.test.tsx`
 * (objectui#6665): the `props` leg renders `No results found`, the `properties`
 * leg renders the rows.
 *
 * Every gate accepts the `props` spelling — `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`
 * with `[key: string]: any` — and `props` is documented as the annotated legacy
 * alias of the config bag, so nothing between the author and the screen says a
 * word. That is the success-receipt shape objectui#6575 and objectui#6665 exist
 * to remove; this is the third instance, and the first at a tier that covers
 * every renderer instead of one component.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It changes NO behaviour. Hoisting `props` to parity with `properties` was
 * option 1 and the maintainer REFUSED it (ruling 2026-08-29, verbatim
 * 「同意」 on option 2): hoisting would weld the legacy alias in as a permanent
 * second spelling, the opposite of this repo's alias-retirement direction.
 * Refusing the key at parse was option 3 and stays blocked on the
 * `.passthrough()` ceiling (objectui#5155 / objectui#6269). So the trap stops
 * being silent; it does not stop being a trap, and what every renderer receives
 * is byte-for-byte what it received before — pinned directly, not asserted, in
 * `SchemaRenderer.propsBagDiagnostic.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## Why `console.warn`, when its neighbour in this directory uses `error`
 *
 * Two conventions cross here and the choice follows the SHAPE, not the tier.
 * `unevaluatedExpression.ts` sits at this same tier and shouts with
 * `console.error`, but its subject is different: a raw `${…}` placed VERBATIM
 * in front of a user. Nothing is placed here — a value is dropped. That is
 * exactly objectui#6575's and objectui#6665's subject ("you declared something
 * and the renderer dropped it"), and both of those emit `console.warn`. The
 * card names this the third instance of that shape, so it joins that family.
 *
 * ## Level and dedupe were chosen from a census, not from taste
 *
 * The ruling fixed the order: measure component-level `props` usage across the
 * in-repo corpus FIRST, and tune level/dedupe so the diagnostic informs rather
 * than floods. Measured on `faac0d935` by walking every JSON document, every
 * `json` fence in every `.md`/`.mdx`, and every TypeScript object literal in
 * the repo (TS compiler API) for nodes carrying both `type` and `props`:
 * 39 such nodes, of which 22 are on component-renderer types — and 19 of those
 * 22 are test fixtures exercising this exact shape on purpose. The authored,
 * non-test corpus holds 5, none of them in application runtime metadata.
 *
 * So there is nothing to flood, and the level is not softened for volume. The
 * dedupe is still keyed on the MESSAGE rather than on the schema object,
 * because the failure the census makes plausible is a metadata GENERATOR that
 * emits the same wrong envelope on many nodes: those are distinct schema
 * objects, so an object-keyed `WeakSet` (the shape
 * `reportUnevaluatedExpressions` uses next door) would print one line per node
 * for one authoring bug. Keying on the rendered message collapses that to one
 * line while still giving two genuinely different nodes two lines. Full census
 * table: the objectui#6708 PR body.

 * of `propsWithoutCanonicalKeys(schema.props, schema.properties)`, passed in
 * rather than re-derived. That is what makes the message honest about the two

 *
 *   - a key BOTH bags declare has already been subtracted by that function

 *   - a key only `props` declares survives into that bag, and it is exactly the
 *     key that reaches no `schema` reader.
 *
 * `authoredPropsBag` is what the AUTHOR wrote, read off the original schema
 * before the evaluation memo touched it. It is needed because that memo
 * rebuilds the bag with `{ ...newSchema.props }` under a bare truthiness guard,
 * so a degenerate `props: 'not-a-bag'` arrives at the spread site as
 * `{ '0': 'n', '1': 'o', … }` — measured, not supposed. Reading only the
 * outgoing bag would therefore report nine dropped keys named `0` … `8` and
 * tell the author that `schema.0` is undefined, which is true and useless. A
 * string is not a config bag; there is nothing to point at, and the shape-level
 * defect it represents is a different question from this one.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, and each exclusion is a reading rather than an omission:
 *
 *   - an EMPTY bag says nothing was authored and nothing was lost;
 *   - a non-object authored `props` is the degenerate case above;
 *   - a node in the {@link readsPropsBag} family is silent by the ruling.

 * Refusal: a NODE-GATE PREDICATE was parked under `props` (objectui#9108,
 * maintainer ruling 2026-09-13, verbatim 「同意」 on the `domain:spec` seat's
 * recommendation - REFUSE).
 *
 * ## The defect this refuses
 *
 * Measured at node level on `1e0e46af9`, four rows, both spellings and both
 * polarities:
 *
 *   { type: 'card', props:      { visible: false } }  -> the node RENDERED
 *   { type: 'card', props:      { hidden:  true  } }  -> the node RENDERED
 *   { type: 'card', properties: { visible: false } }  -> correctly hidden
 *   { type: 'card', properties: { hidden:  true  } }  -> correctly hidden
 *
 * `SchemaRenderer` hoists `properties.*` onto the node; NOTHING copies
 * `props.*`. Both node gates read the post-hoist node, so a predicate that
 * arrived under the alias is never one of the keys either gate can see. It is
 * fail-OPEN and silent by construction - a gate that never bit renders exactly
 * like a gate that said yes - so no user, no screenshot and no snapshot can
 * find it. Only counting can.
 *
 * ## Why REFUSE and not HONOUR - this is a ruling, not a preference
 *
 * The opposite arm was implemented and CLOSED (PR objectui#9144). The ruling's
 * decisive axis: honouring the alias would have made
 * *"8 predicate keys work while the rest stayed silently dropped - and partly
 * working is harder to learn from than not working"*, because the author
 * generalises "`props` is fine" and collides again on the next key with the
 * cause now further away. The three measured readings behind it, each with a
 * control that fires: `@objectstack/spec` already refuses `props` by name
 * (`unrecognized_keys ["props"]`); `skills/objectui/rules/protocol.md` teaches
 * it as an ERROR rather than as a gap; and the producer census found ZERO
 * authored `props` bags across `examples/**` and `content/docs/**` (controls:
 * `visibleWhen` 9 files, `type` 488 files), so there is no capability to cut.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It changes NO verdict and NO rendered byte. Every gate answers exactly what
 * it answered before, nothing is hoisted, `schema.<KEY>` stays undefined for a
 * renderer declared as `({ schema })`, and the bag reaches the element with the
 * same keys it always did. The trap stops being SILENT; it does not stop being
 * a trap, which is the same posture objectui#6708 took one card earlier and the
 * only posture a diagnostic can take without becoming the honour arm the ruling
 * refused.
 *
 * ## Why `console.error`, and why NOT dev-only
 *
 * Two established postures in this tree, and this leg needs a leg of each:
 *
 *   - SEVERITY from `unevaluatedExpression.ts`, which is this repo's REFUSAL
 *     tier. Its neighbour {@link reportDroppedPropsBag} warns because it
 *     reports a value that was dropped; the ruling's word here is *refused*,
 *     and the sibling gate diagnostic states the split explicitly ("not the
 *     refusal `reportUnevaluatedExpressions` emits").
 *   - ALWAYS-ON from `visibilityDiagnostic.ts`'s unresolvable-predicate leg,
 *     which the maintainer took out of `__DEV__` in objectui#6038 (ruling
 *     2026-08-25, option B: "the silence is no longer an accepted property")
 *     on the ground that a node gate which has stopped biting in production is
 *     a class-1 defect that must not be able to sit live and undiscovered.
 *     This is that class in its widest form - the gate never bit at all, on
 *     every render - and the ruling's own confidence gap is about exactly the
 *     population a `__DEV__` gate would silence: *"The producer census covers
 *     this repository's `examples/**`, `content/docs/**` and skills corpus.
 *     It does NOT measure authored metadata in production. If stored documents
 *     out there do carry `props`, those authors are already suffering the
 *     silent drop today."*
 *
 * The rate limit that makes an always-on console line affordable is the same
 * one objectui#6038 required: the dedupe below is keyed on the MESSAGE, so the
 * ceiling is one line per distinct authoring bug for the lifetime of the page,
 * not one line per render and not one per node.
