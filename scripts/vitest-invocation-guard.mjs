/**
 * Rejects the Vitest invocations that silently produce a FALSE GREEN — the
 * verdicts `evaluateVitestInvocation` returns below, each pinned in
 * `scripts/__tests__/vitest-invocation-guard.test.ts`. Read that test for the
 * set that is refused today; a count written here would go stale in silence.
 *
 * Called from the top of `vitest.config.mts` — the repo's ONE Vitest config
 * since objectui#3240 — and from every other config file Vitest can pick up
 * instead of it, so it covers EVERY entry point: `pnpm test`,
 * `pnpm --filter <pkg> test`, `turbo run test`, and a bare `pnpm exec vitest`
 * typed in any directory.
 *
 * ## How a config reaches this file
 *
 * Vitest loads the config it finds in the directory it was launched from, so
 * "the root config calls the guard" only covers a package-cwd run when that
 * directory's own config resolution ends at the root file. That is a claim
 * about the tree, and this docstring has been WRONG about it once already
 * (objectui#5406: it asserted "every per-package `vitest.config.ts`
 * re-exports the root config" while eleven standalone ones did not). It is now
 * ENFORCED instead of asserted — `scripts/__tests__/vitest-invocation-guard
 * .test.ts` walks the repo and fails on any config taking none of the routes
 * below. Read that test, not this paragraph, for what is true today.
 *
 *   1. NO config in the directory. The lookup walks up and lands on the root
 *      config, whose module scope runs the guard. This is now the common case:
 *      objectui#3240 deleted the 17 per-package `vitest.config.ts` files plus
 *      `examples/schema-catalog`'s, so no `packages/*` directory carries one.
 *   2. A config that IMPORTS the root config — `apps/console/vitest.config.ts`,
 *      the last one left, which the root `projects` array also brings in by
 *      absolute path as the `@object-ui/console` project. Importing it executes
 *      its module scope, so the guard runs as a side effect.
 *   3. A STANDALONE `vitest.config.*` that never mentions the root file. None
 *      exists today; the route is kept because the walk above cannot assume
 *      that stays true. Such a config must call this module itself:
 *
 *          import { assertCanonicalVitestInvocation, repoRootFrom }
 *            from '../../scripts/vitest-invocation-guard.mjs';
 *          assertCanonicalVitestInvocation({ repoRoot: repoRootFrom(import.meta.url) });
 *
 *   4. ⭐ NO `vitest.config.*` but a `vite.config.*` — the route objectui#3240
 *      had to close before it could delete anything. Vitest falls back to the
 *      package's VITE config, which is a build config: root becomes the package
 *      directory, and 22 of the 23 under `packages/` carried a vestigial
 *      `test` block (`passWithNoTests: true`, a partial `resolve.alias`, a
 *      setup file the root config does not use). Measured on `main` before the
 *      change, from a package with no vitest config:
 *
 *          cd packages/plugin-ai && pnpm exec vitest run
 *          => RUN v4.1.10 /…/packages/plugin-ai    <- root is the PACKAGE
 *             (no guard output at all)
 *
 *      Deleting the per-package vitest configs would have moved 14 more
 *      packages onto this route — widening the hole objectui#5406 closed, in
 *      the name of closing it. So every `packages/<pkg>/vite.config.ts` now calls
 *      this module, and the vestigial `test` blocks are gone. The call is
 *      gated on `process.env.VITEST`, which Vitest sets when it loads a config
 *      and `vite build` does not (measured both ways) — the same file has to
 *      keep working as the build config, and a build must never be refused.
 *
 * ## Not covered, deliberately
 *
 * `examples/byo-backend-console` and `examples/console-starter` carry a
 * `vite.config.ts` and no test script. They are templates a user copies out of
 * the repo, so a `../../scripts/` import would break them where it matters
 * most. Unchanged by objectui#3240 — they were on route 4 before it and after.
 *
 * ## Trap 1 — Vitest launched with the cwd inside a package (objectui#3378)
 *
 *     cd packages/app-shell && pnpm exec vitest run
 *     # identical to what `pnpm --filter @object-ui/app-shell test` runs
 *     => Test Files  22 passed (22)   <- all 22 belong to @object-ui/console;
 *                                        app-shell's own 281 files never ran
 *
 * Vitest sets its `root` to the cwd. The root-level projects (`unit`, `dom`,
 * `dom-heavy`) declare `include` relative to that root — `packages/**`,
 * `examples/**`, `scripts/**` — and from inside `packages/app-shell` those
 * globs resolve to `packages/app-shell/packages/**`, matching nothing at all.
 * The one project that still resolves is `apps/console`, because the root
 * config brings it in by ABSOLUTE path. So the run collects 22 foreign files,
 * passes them, and prints a green summary. Nothing in that output says "0 tests
 * matched" — the count is 22, not 0, so `passWithNoTests` never even enters the
 * picture. An agent verifying "this package is green" by the package-level
 * convention reports success for a package it never executed.
 *
 * ## Trap 2 — a path filter that never reaches Vitest (objectui#3288)
 *
 *     pnpm --filter @object-ui/fields test -- --run packages/fields/src/a.test.ts
 *     => Test Files  22 passed (22)   <- again @object-ui/console's files
 *
 * pnpm forwards the `--` VERBATIM into the script, so Vitest is invoked as
 * `vitest run -- --run packages/fields/src/a.test.ts`. Vitest's CLI parser
 * stops at `--` and discards everything after it, including the path. The
 * filter is not "ignored with a warning" — it is gone before Vitest sees a
 * path, and the run falls back to the default set (which, per trap 1, is
 * somebody else's package). The newly added test file executes zero times and
 * the output is green.
 *
 * The same miss one step removed: a filter that DOES reach Vitest but matches
 * nothing (a typo, or a path spelled relative to the wrong directory) also used
 * to exit 0, because the root config set `passWithNoTests: true`
 * unconditionally. `cliHasTestFilters()` below is what the root config now uses
 * to switch that off for exactly the runs that asked for specific files: "I
 * named files and zero matched" is an error, while "no filter, and one project
 * happens to hold no files" stays fine.
 *
 * ## Trap 3 — an appended path filter that WIDENS the run (objectui#7814)
 *
 *     pnpm --filter @object-ui/cli test packages/cli/src/__tests__/app-generator.test.ts
 *     => Test Files  17 passed (17)   <- the whole package, not the one file
 *        Tests      266 passed (266)      (the file alone is 1 file / 47 tests)
 *
 * objectui#3240 bakes a positional into every package `test` script
 * (`vitest run --root ../.. packages/<pkg>/`), and Vitest UNIONS positional
 * filters. The appended path therefore does not replace the baked one, it sits
 * beside it, and every file the baked filter admits still runs. Exit 0, green
 * summary — the package's count read as the file's. `subsumed-positional-filter`
 * refuses it; the numbers above are from the measurement on that card and are a
 * timestamp, not a live reading.
 *
 * ## The canonical invocation
 *
 *     pnpm exec vitest run packages/<pkg>/src/<file>.test.ts   # from the REPO ROOT
 *
 * From the repo root, and with NO `--` in front of the paths. AGENTS.md
 * (§测试纪律) carries the same lines.
 *
 * ## Deliberately strict
 *
 * Any run whose Vitest root is not the repo root is refused, rather than
 * refused only when it collects zero of its own files. "Collects zero of its
 * own files" would have been the WEAKER trigger, and objectui#5406 shows why:
 * under the 11 standalone configs a package-cwd run does collect the package's
 * own files and can go green — that green just says nothing about CI, which
 * runs those same files under the root config's aliases, project split and
 * setup files. The defect is the divergent config, not the empty collection.
 * "root == repo root" is also one comparison an agent can hold in its head,
 * unlike a heuristic that fires only sometimes. objectui#3240 has since settled
 * what the package-level `test` scripts are: every one of them names the repo
 * root explicitly (`vitest run --root ../.. packages/<pkg>/`), so they satisfy
 * this comparison instead of tripping it, and `pnpm --filter <pkg> test` /
 * `turbo run test` load the same config as CI. ⛔ The same config is NOT the
 * same conclusion: objectui#3240 moved Vitest's ROOT, and `process.cwd()` does
 * not move with it — under the package-level form the cwd is still
 * `packages/<pkg>/`, so anything that reads it answers differently there than
 * CI does. This guard is one of those things whenever a TEST imports a config
 * and re-enters it (objectui#8590): the worker's `process.argv` carries no
 * `--root`, so the cwd decides and the package-level form is refused after the
 * run is already under way. AGENTS.md §测试纪律 carries the same correction.
 *
 * Escape hatch, documented in AGENTS.md: `OBJECTUI_VITEST_GUARD=off`.
