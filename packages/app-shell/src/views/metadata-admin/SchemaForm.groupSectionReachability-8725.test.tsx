/**
 * objectui#8725 — a `{ group }` form section reaching `SchemaForm`.
 *
 * ## What this file pinned before, and why those pins were rewritten
 *
 * This file first landed as a MEASUREMENT (PR #8739): its runtime pins asserted
 * that a spec-legal `{ group }` section, arriving on the untyped `/meta/types`
 * server document, made `SchemaForm` throw `TypeError: s.fields is not
 * iterable` out of the component body — from the pre-flight `for…of` in
 * `SchemaFormBody`, upstream of both `.map` sites the card named — and took every
 * well-formed sibling section with it, on the simple and the tabbed arm alike.
 * Its compile-time pins asserted that `FormSectionSpec` refused the spec-legal
 * shape (a barrier on the TypeScript channel only) and that
 * `RichMetadataTypeEntry.form` admitted it untyped (the channel that did carry
 * it). Those pins were meant to go red when the ruling landed, and they did.
 *
 * ## The ruling they now pin (PM ruling on objectui#8725)
 *
 *  - `FormSectionSpec.fields` is OPTIONAL, matching `@objectstack/spec`.
 *  - Every read of a section's `fields` in `SchemaForm` sees a RESOLVED section:
 *    a `{ group }` section goes through `@object-ui/plugin-form`'s
 *    `resolveSectionGroupReferences`, the one resolver `ObjectForm` and
 *    `apps/console`'s `FormPage` already use, so this renderer gives THEIR answer
 *    — including for a group that names no declared field group.
 *  - ⛔ Not `?? []`. What the old crash pins protected survives the rewrite: a
 *    malformed section is a throw or a report, never a silent drop.
 *  - `RichMetadataTypeEntry.form` is `FormViewSpec`, not an untyped record.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ What "the resolver's answer" is HERE, measured rather than assumed
 *
 * A `group` resolves against the BOUND OBJECT's `fieldGroups`. `SchemaForm`
 * renders metadata-type editors (`data: { provider: 'schema', schemaId }`), the
 * `/meta/types` entry carries a `schema` and a `form` but no field groups, and
 * no host hands this component an object definition. So every `{ group }`
 * section here is one that "names no declared field group", and the resolver's
 * defined answer for that — measured, and identical in `FormPage` for the same
 * section over an object that does not declare the group — is an EMPTY section
 * plus a `console.error` naming the group. The pins below assert exactly that,
 * by calling the resolver with `SchemaForm`'s own inputs rather than by
 * restating its output, so a change to the resolver moves this file with it.
