/**
 * HTTP Method for API requests
 * Canonical definition from @objectstack/spec/ui.
 *
 * The spec renamed this export twice. `HttpMethod` used to name two DIFFERENT
 * types depending on the entry point — the 7-value enum on `./shared` / `./api`
 * (which adds `HEAD` / `OPTIONS`) and the 5-value UI subset on `./ui`. 17.0.0
 * split them as `HttpMethodType` (objectstack#4691); 17.0.0-rc.5 renamed that
 * again to `HttpMethodSubset` (objectstack#5832, PR objectstack#5976), because
 * `schemaNameFromExportKey` strips the `Schema` suffix and both enums published
 * as `shared/HttpMethod` — the later write won, so the emitted JSON Schema and
 * reference page described only the 5-value one.
 *
 * The 5-value RUNTIME domain is unchanged by either rename; we alias it back to
 * `HttpMethod` so `@object-ui/types`' public surface stays verbatim identical.
 * Do NOT re-point this at the spec's bare `HttpMethod`: that is the 7-value
 * enum, and `ApiDataSource` means the 5-value one. Widening it would let
 * `method: 'HEAD'` compile and then throw in `HttpRequestSchema.parse()`.

 *
 *  - it declared SIX keys and called itself "canonical", while rc.6's
 *    `GanttConfigSchema` declares seventeen. The eleven it never mentioned —
 *    `parentField`, `typeField`, `baselineStartField`, `baselineEndField`,
 *    `groupByField`, `resourceView`, `assigneeField`, `effortField`,
 *    `capacity`, `quickFilters`, `autoZoomToFilter` — are not hypothetical
 *    upstream additions: `plugin-gantt/src/ObjectGantt.tsx` reads every one of
 *    them, through a local `GanttConfigEx` intersection that re-declared them
 *    because this type did not;
 *  - the `tooltipFields` comment said "not part of the upstream
 *    GanttConfigSchema". It is, as of rc.6, so the key now arrives from the
 *    spec and the note is gone with it.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE LOOSENESS THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO REST ON IS GONE. `GanttConfigSchema`
 * was `$loose` upstream, so a key the spec did not declare passed its parse
 * instead of being rejected, and the members intersected below were legal
 * metadata riding that window. objectstack#15469 CLOSED it: the schema is a
 * `strictObject`, an undeclared key is refused by name, and the ten keys objectui
 * read through the window — `timeSegments` among them — are DECLARED upstream
 * with describes. So the members below no longer extend the spec's vocabulary;
 * they restate part of it, and `SpecGanttConfig` already carries every one.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not read this block as an extension point. Writing an undeclared sub-key
 * into `timeSegments` (or any member here) is refused at parse now, where it
 * used to pass — the prose said the opposite until objectui#7845 corrected it.

 * **This key set is the spec's, and it is exactly what `ObjectGrid` reads.**
 * It mirrors `ListViewExportOptionsSchema` in `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0
 * (`packages/spec/src/ui/view.zod.ts`, added by objectstack#8010 /
 * objectstack#8324): `formats`, `maxRecords`, `includeHeaders`,
 * `fileNamePrefix`, `streaming`. Upstream derived those five keys FROM this
 * renderer's reads, so the two are one contract read from either end:
 *
 * - a sixth key declared here is capability surface with no reader — the
 *   compile-time key-set assertion in `objectql.exportOptions.test.ts` reds;
 * - a sixth key READ by `ObjectGrid` without being declared here recreates the
 *   undeclared-but-read defect objectstack#8010 closed — the source scan in
 *   `plugin-grid`'s `ObjectGrid.exportOptionsKeys.test.ts` reds.
 *
 * NOTE (objectui#4535): this restates the five keys rather than deriving them
 * from the spec symbol, and the reason is no longer the pin. objectui now
 * installs `@objectstack/spec@17.2.0`, which DOES carry the object form — the
 * bare format array lifts to `{ formats: [...] }` at parse and `'pdf'` is gone
 * from the enum. What is missing is the SYMBOL: `ListViewExportOptionsSchema`
 * is internal to the spec bundle and not among the package's public exports, so
 * there is nothing to import. Only the enclosing `ListViewSchema` is exported,
 * and its `exportOptions` is the two-branch union (legacy-array lift ∪ object),
 * whose `z.infer` is a union — not this interface.
 *
 * So the mirror is restated but not unchecked: `export-options-spec-parity.test.ts`
 * reads the object branch out of the INSTALLED spec at test time and asserts
 * this key set, the format enum and the strictness against it. Prose claiming
 * alignment is what went false last time; that test is what makes the claim
 * falsifiable. When upstream exports the symbol, derive from it and delete the
 * restatement — the shape below is already the spec's, so nothing else moves.

/**
 * The `ObjectGridSchema` keys a view's `table` slot may carry: every member

 * ⚠️ This is an explicit list, and NOT `Omit<ObjectGridSchema, 'type' | 'objectName'>`,
 * because `Omit` collapses here (objectui#6269). `Omit<T, K>` is
 * `Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, K>>`, and `keyof T` on a type carrying a string
 * index signature is `string | number` — the literal member names are ABSORBED.
 * `ObjectGridSchema` inherits `BaseSchema`'s `[key: string]: any`
 * (objectui#5155), so the `Omit` rebuilt a type holding the index signature and
 * NONE of the 61 named members: measured through the checker,
 * `Omit<ObjectGridSchema, 'type' | 'objectName'>` declared 0 properties. The
 * slot accepted anything (`table: { colunms: 3 }` type-checked), offered no

 * deliver. `Pick` with LITERAL keys never computes `keyof T`, so it cannot
 * collapse the same way.
 *
 * 🔒 The duplicate-list hazard — a member added to `ObjectGridSchema` and not to
 * this list — is pinned by
 * `src/__tests__/object-view-slot-key-lists.test.ts`, which recomputes the
 * source schema's declared members through the TypeScript checker and requires
 * set equality with this list.
 *
 * 🗑️ When a #5155 phase removes `BaseSchema`'s root index signature, `Omit`
 * stops collapsing: this list, `ObjectFormSlotKey` below, and their pin all
 * become removable in favour of the original `Omit` form.

   * 「我们的项目以 objectstack 协议为准，文档应该以实际实现为准。协议不正确的应该先修改协议。」
   *
   * ## The requiredness was refuted by the corpus, not just by the protocol
   *
   * objectui#7322 justified it as "every documented and tested `object-kanban`
   * node authors this key". Two lane-less producers were excluded from that
   * count at objectui#7780 and neither has gone away:
   *
   *   1. `content/docs/utilities/data-objectstack.mdx` documents an
   *      `object-kanban` node that is exactly `{ type, dataSource }` — no
   *      `groupBy`. ⚠️ WEAKER THAN IT LOOKS, and the limit is worth stating: that
   *      fragment is STILL refused after this card, at `RECORD_SOURCE_REQUIRED`
   *      — `dataSource` is not a rung of this ladder — so it is evidence that a
   *      lane-less board is a DOCUMENTED AUTHORING, not a document this card
   *      admits. ⛔ Do not cite it as "objectui refuses its own documented
   *      example" without that qualifier; the record-source half of the refusal
   *      is deliberate and survives.
   *   2. `packages/plugin-list/src/ListView.tsx` GENERATES the node with
   *      `groupBy: laneField`, where
   *      `laneField = groupByField || groupField || detectStatusField(objectDef) || undefined`.
   *      ⭐ This is the load-bearing one, and it is stronger than the explicit
   *      `|| undefined` alone suggests: `objectDef` loads ASYNCHRONOUSLY, so
   *      `laneField` is `undefined` on EVERY load until it lands — transiently
   *      for every list-view kanban — and PERSISTENTLY in two cases from
   *      `detectStatusField` (`packages/types/src/record-semantics.ts`): the
   *      object declares no `stageField` role AND carries no field named
   *      `status` / `stage` / `state` / `phase` and none typed `status`/`stage`;
   *      or it sets `stageField: false`, which suppresses detection outright
   *      (ADR-0085 — a status-shaped field that is not a linear flow). The
   *      renderer serves that node and both published faces refused it.
   *
   * ⇒ Evidence 2 carries this on its own; evidence 1 supports the authoring
   * shape, not the accept set. Same shape as {@link objectName} (objectui#7780):
   * a key the renderer guards at every read, declared REQUIRED, refusing boards
   * that render today.
   *
   * ## What a lane-less board actually does — MEASURED, not argued
   *
   * The `if (!schema.groupBy)` branches are defensive early-returns and the
   * board degrades rather than breaking. Rendered through `SchemaRenderer` with
   * a real `dataSource` (pinned in
   * `plugin-kanban/src/__tests__/laneLessBoard-8990.test.tsx`):
   *
   *   - no `groupBy`, no `columns` -> `effectiveColumns` falls past all three
   *     of its `schema.groupBy &&` guards and returns `[]`: an empty board, no
   *     lanes, no crash.
   *   - no `groupBy`, bare-string `columns` -> the lanes are DRAWN, titled by
   *     the raw strings (see {@link columns}); this is the arm this card
   *     unlocks.
   *   - EVERY lane-less board holds ZERO cards, whatever its `columns`.
   *     `bucketCardsIntoColumns` opens with `if (!data || !groupBy ||
   *     !Array.isArray(data)) return columns.map(...)`, so with no lane key the
   *     records are never distributed. A lane-less board is lane HEADINGS, not
   *     a populated board — which is the honest rendering of "no field places
   *     these records", and is why relaxing this key is not a licence to author
   *     it away.
   *   - card moves are inert, by the same guards: `persistCardMove` and the
   *     `handleCardMove` callback both open `if (!groupBy) return`, so nothing
   *     is written back.
   *
   * ⇒ The widening admits documents that RENDER; it does not admit documents
   * that crash. ⛔ It is NOT an invitation to omit the key: a board that groups
   * by nothing shows no cards.
   *
   * ## ⛔ What this does NOT reach — objectui#8993
   *
   * `bucketCardsIntoColumns`'s double-bucketing of a non-string lane id lives
   * AFTER that `!groupBy` early return (the `knownIds` set and the
   * `__uncolumned__` lane below it). A lane-less board returns before reaching
   * it, and the picklist-materialised lanes whose ids come straight from
   * `opt.value` are built under `if (schema.groupBy && ...)` — a branch a
   * lane-less board cannot enter. So objectui#8993's reachable set is UNCHANGED
   * by this card — admitting documents cannot shrink it, and none of the
   * documents newly admitted can reach the defect. ⛔ Not "narrowed": the
   * containment is that nothing was widened. Measured both ways in the pin file
   * above.

   * object-first mix sends every string element down the object branch and a

   * {@link KanbanColumn} requires `cards`. It is the RUNTIME lane shape — what

   * consume, with `cards` always filled — and using it as the AUTHORING
   * element would refuse three live shapes, each measured rather than argued:
   *
   *   1. the protocol's own gate-validated example
   *      (`content/docs/protocol/objectui/layout-dsl.mdx`, under an
   *      `os:check-yaml PageComponentSchema` fence) authors three lanes as
   *      `{ id, title }` with no `cards`;
   *   2. the renderer never requires `cards` — `bucketCardsIntoColumns` reads
   *      `col.cards || []` on both of its legs, and the lanes it materializes
   *      from a picklist or from the data carry no `cards` at all;
   *   3. this repository's own typed corpus authors `columns: [{ id, title }]`
   *      under `satisfies ObjectKanbanSchema` in several `plugin-kanban` board
   *      tests.
   *
   * ⇒ `cards` is OPTIONAL on the authoring arm. A lane that carries it is a
   * static board's lane and its cards are judged; a lane that does not is a
   * swimlane and receives its cards from the record source.
   *
   * ## The member set is the READ set

   *
   * ## ⭐ The bare-string arm is REACHABLE since objectui#8990
   *
   * The `object-kanban` renderer honours a bare-string lane list only when no
   * `groupBy` is authored (`ObjectKanban.tsx`, the `effectiveColumns` memo:
   * the string branch returns only under `if (!schema.groupBy)`). While
   * {@link groupBy} was REQUIRED, no document that passed this schema could
   * reach that branch, and objectui#8913 admitted the arm anyway — refusing it
   * would have made objectui narrower than the protocol — recording it as
   * inert. objectui#8990 made {@link groupBy} OPTIONAL, which is what makes the
   * arm reachable BY A SCHEMA-VALID DOCUMENT: a `groupBy`-less board with
   * `columns: ['todo', 'doing']` now parses AND draws those two lanes, titled by
   * the raw strings.
   *
   * ⚠️ The qualifier is load-bearing, and matches {@link groupBy}'s. The RENDERER
   * never consulted this package's validator — `SchemaRenderer` runs core's
   * structural `validateSchema`, which carries no kanban rule — so the string
   * branch was always live for a document that reached it WITHOUT passing the
   * published faces (`ListView.tsx`'s generated node; any host not running
   * `os check`). What the requiredness prevented was a document being valid AND
   * getting there. ⛔ Do not restate this as "the arm was dead code".
   *
   * ⚠️ RAW strings, not localized labels, and the difference is the arm's
   * signature. The string branch returns `{ id: val, title: val }` and never
   * calls `localizeColumn`; the picklist branch a GROUPED board takes returns
   * the option LABELS. Measured on one object whose `status` options are
   * `todo -> 'To Do'` / `doing -> 'Doing'`: lane-less draws `todo` / `doing`,
   * the grouped control draws `To Do` / `Doing`.
   *
   * ⚠️ Reachable is not populated: every lane-less board holds ZERO cards,
   * because `bucketCardsIntoColumns` early-returns before distributing records
   * when there is no lane key. See {@link groupBy} for the full measured vector.
   * Pinned in `plugin-kanban/src/__tests__/laneLessBoard-8990.test.tsx`.
   *
   * ⚠️ An undeclared lane key is ACCEPTED AND DROPPED from the parsed output,
   * not refused — the lane arm is a plain (non-passthrough) object, the same
   * posture {@link KanbanColumn}'s mirror carries. That is the TOLERANT face's
   * posture: the strict authoring twin refuses the same key by name. The
   * `color` tombstone that mirror holds is deliberately NOT carried here: it
   * retired with the `kanban` arm (objectui#7664) and refusing a key BY NAME on
   * this face is a separate decision, not part of this declaration.

   *
   * ⚠️ It is NOT the function the board implementation receives — `ObjectKanban`

   * parameter — so an authored one reaches nothing, which is a `'retired'`
   * reading that `check:handler-key-reads` refuses while `KanbanRenderer` still
   * reads the key. It keeps its `KNOWN_UNDECLARED_READS` row on objectui#7804.
   *
   * ⚠️ TWO PARAMETERS since objectui#9341, and the second is what the surviving

 * of the published `ObjectChartProps.schema`.
 *
 * Until that card this shape anchored NOTHING: `ObjectChart` was published as
 * `(props: any)`, so every `schema={{ … }}` literal handed to it was checked
 * against nothing at all, and four keys its producers write and its renderer
 * reads — `xAxisKey`, `series`, `aggregate`, `filter` — were declared on
 * neither this interface nor its zod mirror. They rode `BaseSchema`'s
 * `[key: string]: any` / `.passthrough()` and arrived UNVALIDATED.
 *
 * ## AUTHORABLE vs INTERNAL, per key (objectui#7946, ADR-0049)
 *
 * The four keys added by that card do NOT share one verdict, and the ruling
 * asked for the reading rather than the assumption:
 *
 *   - `aggregate` — AUTHORABLE, and declared BY REFERENCE as the spec's own
 *     `ChartAggregate`. `ChartAggregateSchema` calls itself "Inline aggregation
 *     for an OBJECT-bound chart", names its carrier as the react tier's
 *     `<ObjectChart objectName aggregate={…}>` (ADR-0081), and objectstack#5020
 *     wired the publish gate (`validate-react-page-props.ts` calls
 *     `ChartAggregateSchema.safeParse()`). This component's registry `inputs`
 *     advertises it too. Because the spec already owns the shape, the ONLY
 *     defensible declaration here is that same symbol: two dialects on one
 *     published key is the drift this whole card exists to close, and the
 *     member doc records what the first cut's local near-copy published.
 *   - `filter` — AUTHORABLE. The spec spells the carrier literally
 *     (`ChartAggregateSchema`'s own guidance: "`filter` is a prop on the chart
 *     itself (`<ObjectChart filter={…}>`)"), declares `ObjectChart.filter` as a
 *     `FilterArray` in its react-blocks prop table, and this component's
 *     registry `inputs` advertises `{ name: 'filter', type: 'array' }`.
 *   - `xAxisKey` — INTERNAL (relay-composed). `ChartRendererProps` calls it
 *     "Internal binding. Authors write the spec `xAxis: { field }`"; the
 *     author-facing spelling ON THIS NODE is `xAxisField` above. All five
 *     producers COMPUTE it (`dims[0]`, `chartCategoryKey(...)`), none forwards
 *     an authored value, and it is absent from the registry `inputs`.
 *   - `series` — INTERNAL (relay-composed). The `{ dataKey }` shape below is
 *     the renderer's internal contract; the spec's author-facing
 *     `ChartSeriesSchema` REFUSES `dataKey` by name (`dataKey` → `name`
 *     rename). All five producers compose it from something else.
 *
 * Both internal keys are still declared HERE and on the mirror: they are read
 * and written today, `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()`, so leaving them
 * undeclared does not make them unauthorable — it only means an `xAxisKey: 42`
 * rides through unchecked. Declaring buys the VALUE check without minting new
 * authorable vocabulary, and the descriptions say which is which.
 *
 * ## The three keys objectui#8885 declared, and why each is bound to the spec
 *
 * `ObjectChart.tsx` reads `drillDown`, `title` and `compareTo` off `schema`,
 * and until objectui#8885 neither published copy of this shape mentioned any of
 * them — the objectui#6914 class (a key read behind a cast, declared on neither
 * published face). They rode `BaseSchema`'s `[key: string]: any` /
 * `.passthrough()` and arrived UNVALIDATED, while two independent declarations
 * already pointed at `drillDown`: this component's registry `inputs` advertise
 * it to the designer palette, and `@objectstack/spec` publishes
 * `ChartDrillDownSchema` for exactly this carrier.
 *
 * ⛔ None of the three is re-declared locally. Each binds to the spec symbol
 * that already owns it, per this file's standing rule ("Never Redefine Types.
 * ALWAYS import them.") — a local near-copy is the fork `check:spec-symbols`
 * exists to stop, and the one that would drift the day the protocol moves:
 *
 *   - `drillDown` → `ChartDrillDown` (`ChartDrillDownSchema`), which the spec
 *     documents as the `ObjectChart` react-tier prop by name.
 *   - `title` → `I18nLabel`, the union the spec's own `ChartConfigSchema.title`
 *     carries and that this package's `normalizeChartSchema` already resolves.
 *   - `compareTo` → `SpecDashboardWidget['compareTo']`, bound BY REFERENCE to
 *     the producer's own declaration (see the member doc).
 *
 * ## The ceiling, stated rather than assumed (objectui#5155)
 *
 * `BaseSchema` still carries `[key: string]: any`, so declaring a key buys it
 * its declared TYPE — `xAxisKey: 42` and `title: 42` are both refused now — but
 * does NOT buy rejection of a MISSPELLING: `xAxisKy: 'x'` and `drillDwn: {}`
 * still compile, exactly as they do on `ObjectGallerySchema` (objectui#6576).
 * ONE ceiling, two cards, and each pins it honestly with its own counter-probe:
 * `__tests__/widget-schema-anchors-7946.test.ts` and
 * `__tests__/object-chart-undeclared-keys-8885.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Two cards ruled on this shape, and neither ruled for the other
 *
 * All eight keys above are declared, but they arrived under two separate
 * rulings — objectui#7946 (`filter`, `aggregate`, `xAxisKey`, `series`,
 * `colors`) and objectui#8885 (`drillDown`, `title`, `compareTo`) — and each
 * card measured only its own. Neither swept the other's keys in, so neither
 * took a disposition on the other's behalf.
 *
 * ⭐ Both census pins were written to survive that, and it is why landing order
 * did not matter: each ledgers the OTHER card's keys by name and asserts only
 * that each is STILL READ, never that it is still undeclared. So declaring a
 * ledgered key does not redden its ledger — dropping the READ does.

   *
   * ⚠️ Narrowing to ONE arm is a decision LOCAL TO THIS NODE, not a

   * there is no fleet-wide convention to renegotiate — what is unresolved is
   * only this component's own two-armed read, and objectui#7946 declares the
   * accept set it measured rather than picking an arm without a ruling.
   *
   * ⭐ The composition that blocked narrowing is FIXED (objectui#8944). The
   * drill-down used to compose this value by SPREADING it into an object
   * literal, which mis-composed the array arm into index keys (`{ 0: […] }`)
   * instead of conditions, so an authored `FilterArray` was silently dropped

   * `composeDrillFilter` (`@object-ui/core`), which routes both arms into the
   * repo's single filter sink — so the array arm survives the drill, and the
   * read that forced the record arm to be declared is gone.
   *
   * ⇒ What remains before this node can narrow to the spec's array-only
   * `FilterArray` is a DEPRECATION, not a defect: live charts author the object
   * form today, and narrowing stops them compiling. That migration is its own
   * card; this docblock no longer names a bug as the blocker.
   *
   * What this declaration buys today is that `filter: 'stage=won'` and

   *   - the zod mirror's local `z.object` is strip-postured, so
   *     `{ groupby: 'stage', function: 'count' }` parsed CLEAN and dropped the
   *     mis-cased key silently — the exact failure the spec's own
   *     `strictObject` history text was written to prevent;
   *   - no typed in-tree producer needed the relaxation: every live forward of

   * `title` / `target` / `columns` / `maxRows`, all six of which
   * `ObjectChart.tsx` reads — while `DrillDownConfig` additionally carries
   * `mode` and `report` for the table / pivot / metric widgets, which this
   * component reads NEITHER of. Declaring the wider type here would advertise

   * `ChartDrillDownSchema.target` already reads
   * `z.enum(['drawer', 'dialog', 'navigate'])` at the published 17.3.0 — and at
   * 17.2.0 before it — after objectstack#5435 widened the union that
   * objectui#3382 had implemented. ⛔ Cite the FLOOR here, never the version the
   * lockfile happens to resolve: a range dependency guarantees the floor, and
   * this sentence previously named 17.4.0 for no better reason than that the
   * tree was resolving 17.4.0 that day.
   *
   * ⇒ What is left is an unmade decision about the DESIGNER PALETTE, not a
   * protocol gap. The `description` on this component's registry `inputs` still
   * lists two arms, and `packages/plugin-charts/src/index.test.ts` pins that
   * withholding BY NAME. Widening an advertised authoring vocabulary is a shape
   * decision, not the prose this round is allowed to touch — see this card's
   * acceptance notes for the named successor. (The prose in `ObjectChart.tsx`
   * that once claimed the protocol itself was narrower is already corrected;
   * objectui#7946's rework round fixed it, so ⛔ do not repeat that half of the
   * claim.)

   *   - `normalizeChartSchema`'s `label()` takes this value as `unknown` and
   *     resolves BOTH arms itself, picking the first string out of a locale map.
   *     ⭐ This is the read that requires the union: declaring `string` alone
   *     would refuse a locale-map `title` that works today.
   *   - `ObjectChart.tsx` passes it to `resolveDrillTitle` as the drill drawer's
   *     heading fallback, and that helper's `fallback` parameter is a plain
   *     `string` (`@object-ui/core`'s `utils/drill-down.ts`). It never sees the

   * `ChartConfigSchema.title` carries — and the spec's `REACT_BLOCKS` entry for
   * `ObjectChart` lists `title` among its `dataProps`, so this is a key the
