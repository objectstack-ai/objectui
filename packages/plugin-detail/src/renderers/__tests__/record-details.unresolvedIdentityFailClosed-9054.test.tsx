 *
 * objectui#9054 — `record:details`' field-security fold must fail CLOSED on an
 * entry whose identity it cannot resolve.
 *
 * ## The defect, in one sentence
 *
 * `filterList` filtered `fields` / `sections[].fields` against the allow-list
 * built from `enforceFieldSecurity` / `redactFields` with an else-branch that
 * KEPT any entry it could not name. Its identity reader is `columnIdentity`
 * alone, so every entry that is not a bare string, `{ field }`, `{ name }` or
 * `{ fieldName }` took that branch and escaped both controls — a field-security
 * control defaulting to *permit* on the one input it could not understand.
 *
 * ## ⭐ What this is NOT, measured rather than assumed
 *
 * The card left ONE question open and said so: the SHAPE was read at the
 * source, the EXPOSURE was not. On `record:related_list` (objectui#8793) the
 * kept column rendered its REAL VALUE, because `RelatedList` resolves a column
 * as `accessorKey || columnIdentity(c)` — a second read point that could name
 * what the fold could not. That second reader is what made #8793 a data leak.
 *
 * Driven here the way a record page drives it — a real `RecordContextProvider`,
 * a real record, the real `DetailView` / `DetailSection` — the answer is
 * **no value ever reaches the screen**. `DetailSection` renders from
 * `field.name` and nothing else; an entry the fold cannot name has no `name`
 * for it either, so `data?.[field.name]` is `data?.[undefined]`. The kept entry
 * painted a labelless `—` "No value" placeholder row. Every escape hatch that
 * could have supplied a second reader was probed and none did: five `render`
 * sub-schema spellings all rendered their own literal or nothing.
 *
 * ⇒ this card is a fail-open DEFAULT on a security boundary, not objectui#8793
 * in a second block. The case `THE EXPOSURE MEASUREMENT` below pins that, so
 * that if anyone ever teaches this path a second identity reader the grade
 * moves loudly instead of silently.
 *
 * ## The instrument, stated rather than smuggled
 *
 * `enforceFieldSecurity` / `redactFields` are read off the block's schema with
 * `(schema as any)`. They are the ONLY switch that makes the fold run at all;
 * using them here is not a claim that they are a declared authoring surface.
