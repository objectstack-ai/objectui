/**
 * objectui#6805 + objectui#6806 — two catalog families author their body under
 * `content`, a key neither renderer reads, and the repair key is NOT the same
 * for both.
 *
 * ## Why one file for two cards
 *
 * They share a defect shape and NOT a repair key, and that is the whole point:
 *
 *   node          renderer reads                             correct key
 *   scroll-area   renderChildren(schema.children)            children
 *   badge         schema.label || renderChildren(schema.body) label
 *
 * ⇒ a blind `content` -> `children` sweep repairs #6805 and SILENTLY LEAVES
 * #6806 BROKEN, behind a green "no `content` left in the catalog" assertion.
 * The counter-probe named `the WRONG generalisation` below is the assertion
 * that exists to make that mistake loud; it is measured, not asserted from
 * theory (a `badge` authoring `children` draws an empty pill — see #6829).
 *
 * The shared method is "author the key this renderer actually reads", never
 * "rename `content` to `children`". So every sweep here is PER RENDERER with
 * its own read set, in the shape objectui#6788 established for `card` nodes.
 *
 * ## The readings this file was written against
 *
 * Measured on `origin/main` `26896c689`, walking all 431 fixtures:
 *
 *   scroll-area   7 nodes, 1 category, ALL SEVEN authoring `content`
 *                 keys authored: type 7 · height 7 · className 7 ·
 *                                content 7 · width 2 · orientation 2
 *   badge        40 nodes, 12 categories, 2 authoring `content`
 *                 keys authored: type 40 · variant 36 · label 31 ·
 *                                className 8 · children 7 · content 2
 *
 * Rendered through the real `SchemaRenderer` the way the docs gallery renders
 * them, BEFORE the fixture edits in this PR:
 *
 *   components-complex-scroll-area/*        elements=5   leaked=1  text=(Radix
 *                                           scrollbar stylesheet only)
 *   components-basic-sidebar/sidebar-…      elements=22  leaked=2
 *                                           text="InboxDraftsSentTrashMain content area"
 *
 * AFTER:
 *
 *   …/tall-300px       elements=36  leaked=0  text=…"Line 1Line 2Line 3"…
 *   …/chat-messages    elements=81  leaked=0  text=…"AUser 1This is a sample message…"
 *   …/sidebar-with-badges elements=22 leaked=0 text="Inbox12Drafts3SentTrashMain content area"
 *
 * `leaked` counts elements carrying the authored array/string as the host
 * attribute `content` — the objectui#5574 class.
 *
 * ## ⭐ The exclusion list, encoded rather than only described
 *
 * `text` nodes authoring `content` are NOT members of this class and must not
 * be swept. `packages/components/src/renderers/basic/text.tsx` reads
 * `schema.content || schema.value`, so those 666 corpus nodes render
 * correctly today — `sidebar-with-badges`'s own sibling `text` nodes are the
 * proof, inside the very fixture #6806 repairs. One key, two renderers,
 * opposite outcomes. A sweep that "fixed" them would break working demos.
 *
 * Corpus-wide, `content` is authored by: text 666 · untyped 30 · sheet 3 ·
 * markdown 3 · card 1 (objectui#6788, in flight) · tooltip 1 · hover-card 1.
 * ⇒ ⛔ a blanket "no `content` anywhere" rule reds on working fixtures, which
 * is why nothing here is written that way. The measured statement this file
 * DOES make is narrower and checkable: inside the two families touched here,
 * every remaining `content` key sits on a `text` node.
 *
 * ⛔ Also not done: teaching either renderer to read `content`. The renderer
 * is the contract (AGENTS.md #0.1); a second dialect for one slot on a
 * published surface is the opposite of the repair. And for `badge`
 * specifically, ⛔ not `body` either even though the renderer reads it —
 * objectui#6771 is retiring `body` as a `children` dialect, so `label` is the
 * spelling the corpus converges on (31 badge nodes already use it).
 *
 * ## Why nothing already red covered either card
 *
 * `catalog-gallery-render.test.tsx` renders both families today and PASSES.
 * Its non-vacuity control is `elements > WRAPPER_ELEMENTS || text`, and it has
 * two DIFFERENT holes here:
 *
 *   - #6805: Radix's own injected scrollbar stylesheet is text, so a
 *     category-wide empty render clears the control on a string the component
 *     itself emitted.
 *   - #6806: the sidebar draws 22 elements and real text, so the control
 *     STRUCTURALLY cannot see two missing badges inside it.
 *
 * (A third hole was measured while sizing this file and filed as
 * objectui#6829: an empty `badge` host element is itself the third element, so
 * a demo drawing nothing but an empty pill clears the control too. Arm A of
 * that card re-authored those seven nodes to `label`; the per-renderer render
 * pin lives in `badge-demo-label-6829.test.tsx`.)
 *
 * ⚠️ The fix for all three is the per-renderer sweep below, ⛔ not a stricter
 * global non-vacuity threshold — that is out of scope here and would red on
 * working fixtures. Whether the sweep generalises to EVERY registered renderer
 * is objectui#6810, an open `needs-user-decision` card; this file deliberately
 * covers only the two renderers these two cards name.
 *
 * Nor could a parse have caught either: `BaseSchema` is `.passthrough()` and
 * carries `[key: string]: any`, so `content` is accepted by zod and by tsc
 * alike. `check-doc-component-types.mjs` rules the question out by name.
 *
 * Module-scope import of `@object-ui/components`, not `beforeAll` (AGENTS.md
 * §测试纪律): registering the renderers is an unbounded module load and must
 * not be billed to a bounded hook timeout.
