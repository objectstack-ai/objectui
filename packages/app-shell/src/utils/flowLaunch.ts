/**
 * How the console STARTS a flow from a click, and which door it knocks on
 * (objectui#12037). Module-internal: the two flow-launch handlers —
 * `useConsoleActionRuntime`'s and `RecordDetailView`'s — call
 * {@link launchConsoleFlow}, and nothing outside this package can import it
 * (it is not re-exported from `utils/index` or the package entry).
 *
 * ## Two doors, chosen by a lookup, not a guess
 *
 * A flow can be started two ways, and they do not apply the same gates:
 *
 * - **the action door**, `POST /api/v1/actions/:object/:action` — the server
 *   resolves the DECLARED action by name and runs every gate the declaration
 *   carries before the flow starts: its `requiredPermissions` (ADR-0066 D4,
 *   whose UI half only hides the button), its activation switch, its param
 *   contract, and a caller-scoped load of the subject record;
 * - **the trigger route**, `POST /api/v1/automation/:flow/trigger` — starts a
 *   flow by name. Ruling A (objectstack-ai/objectstack#22424) refuses a
 *   non-system caller an elevated self-triggered flow there exactly as at the
 *   action door; nothing else about an action applies, because there is none.
 *
 * A click goes through the action door EXACTLY when its object and its `name`
 * resolve to a declared action of type `flow` with the same target, in the
 * object metadata the console already holds ({@link findDeclaredFlowAction}).
 * Every other flow click stays on the trigger route. That is not a fallback
 * for a door that failed: a flow start that names no declared action has no
 * action gate to apply, so the trigger route IS its door. The spec authors two
 * such starts on purpose (triage ruling B on objectui#12037):
 *
 * - an inline page `action:button` (and its `action:icon` / `action:group` /
 *   `action:menu` siblings) with `actionType: 'flow'` and a `target`, whose
 *   `name` is optional ("an inline page button is not a registered object
 *   action") or names no declared action;
 * - a dashboard header action `{ actionType: 'flow', actionUrl }`, which the
 *   dashboard renderer dispatches as `{ name: actionUrl, target: actionUrl }`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **What the lookup cannot see, said rather than assumed.** The object
 * metadata carries an object's own `actions[]`, which since `defineStack`'s
 * bound-action merge includes every `defineAction({ objectName })` declared
 * beside it. It does NOT carry an object-LESS declared action, nor a
 * standalone authored action row that no object definition embeds. A click on
 * either takes the trigger route — what every flow click did before this
 * module existed, so it is no regression, and the elevation refusal above
 * still holds for it. Seeing those would take a click-time `action` metadata
 * fetch, which this module deliberately does not make.
 *
 * ## Who owns which half of the door's exchange
 *
 * The `/actions` REQUEST belongs to `@object-ui/core`'s dispatcher —
 * `createServerActionHandler` owns name-only identity (ADR-0110 D1), the
 * `{ recordId, params }` body and the `_rowRecord` strip, and app-shell names
 * that route nowhere else (`actions-envelope.ratchet.test.ts`). Its ANSWER is
 * not an action envelope, though: it is the flow's `AutomationResult`, and it
 * is read by the flow rule (`interpretFlowResponse` / `judgeFlowLaunch`), so a
 * paused screen run still opens `FlowRunner`, a refused end still opens the
 * Close-only notice, and a `FLOW_FAILED` still prefers the author's
 * `errorMessage`. The dispatcher's own reading (`interpretActionResponse`) has
 * none of those arms, so the transport is injected and the raw answer is read
 * here; the dispatcher's `ActionResult` is used only when no answer arrived.
