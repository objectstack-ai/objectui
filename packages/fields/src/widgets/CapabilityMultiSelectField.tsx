/**
 * CapabilityMultiSelectField — structured picker for a permission set's
 * `system_permissions` (ADR-0056 / epic #2398, phase P2).
 *
 * `sys_permission_set.system_permissions` is framework-declared as a
 * `Field.textarea` that stores a **JSON-serialized array of capability names**
 * (e.g. `["setup.access","studio.access"]`; `security-plugin.ts` writes
 * `JSON.stringify(...)` and reads `parseJson(...)`). Editing that as raw JSON is
 * the anti-pattern ADR-0056 removes. This widget renders the same value as a
 * multi-select over the live `sys_capability` registry — grouped by scope,
 * labelled, with the capability description on hover — while round-tripping the
 * stored value **byte-for-byte** as a JSON string of names.
 *
 * ## Not a registry field widget (objectui#3308)
 *
 * This is a plain component, imported directly by its host — Studio's
 * `PermissionMatrixEditor` (`packages/app-shell`), which is where ADR-0056 P2
 * put the capability editor. It is deliberately NOT reachable through the field
 * registry, and `widget: 'capability-multiselect'` is a **retired** hint: the
 * key only ever existed on the docs-site-only `registerFields()` path, nothing
 * ever stamped the hint (ADR-0056 P1 stamps `permission-facet-link` on all six
 * `sys_permission_set` facets), and it was removed under ADR-0049
 * enforce-or-remove. Do not re-register it without re-deciding ADR-0056 P2 —
 * a field carrying that hint now degrades to its declared `type` renderer,
 * which is the defined behavior for an unregistered widget.

/**
 * objectui#2600 B5 — the curated platform capabilities whose labels this picker
 * localizes client-side via `capability.label.<name>`; package- and
 * admin-authored capabilities keep their authored `sys_capability` label.
 *
 * ## This IS `@objectstack/spec/security`'s `PLATFORM_CAPABILITIES`, and the
 * ## equality is CHECKED rather than claimed (objectui#6285)
 *
 * The names below are the spec's, with the dot spellings written as underscores
 * (see the transform note under the declaration). It used to say that in prose
 * and nothing held it: the spec grew `manage_sharing`, this list did not follow,
 * and that capability fell through to the English label the `sys_capability`
 * registry serves — untranslated in all ten packs, beside seven siblings that
 * localize, with every gate green.
 *
 * What holds it now is `CapabilityMultiSelectField.specParity-6285.test.tsx`,
 * which imports `PLATFORM_CAPABILITIES` and fails on ANY difference in either
 * direction — a member the spec added and this list lacks, or one this list
 * keeps after the spec dropped it. A spec bump that moves the vocabulary turns
 * CI red here before it can reach a screen.
 *
 * ## Why a repo-local list rather than a runtime derivation
 *
 * `new Set(PLATFORM_CAPABILITIES.map(…))` was built and measured (objectui#6285,
 * and the branch history carries the numbers). It costs nothing in bundle terms
 * — +0.3 KB gzipped on the console's eager closure, because the console's graph
 * already reaches those modules — so bundle size is NOT the reason, and the
 * `useTenancyPosture.ts` precedent's reason does not apply here.
 *
 * The reason is instrument coverage. `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs`
 * reads this declaration as the `capability.label.` family's vocabulary and
 * expands it into exact `en` key checks; its reader parses source and needs a
 * literal `new Set([…])`, so a computed initialiser is `unreadable-vocabulary`
 * and the family would have to fall back to `enumerable: false`, dropping the
 * gate from 18 vocabularies / 113 exactly-checked members to 17 / 105. The gate
 * documents one bridge for a vocabulary living in a dependency — "a repo-local
 * exhaustive `Record<Union, …>` this reader can read" — and it is unavailable:
 * `PlatformCapability.name` is typed `string`, so the spec publishes no union to
 * key a `Record` by.
 *
 * And the benefit a derivation would have bought is not real. A capability the
 * spec adds cannot "arrive automatically": its `capability.label.*` key still
 * has to be authored by a human in ten packs, or it renders the registry English
 * (this card's exact defect) or a raw key. `manage_sharing` is the proof — it
 * had no key anywhere. Deriving does not remove the human step; it only chooses
 * which instrument reports it. So the shape that keeps BOTH instruments — this
 * list read by the gate, and the parity test read by CI — wins on the only axis
 * that separates them.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not hand-edit this list to match a new spec release without also
 * authoring `capability.label.<name>` in all ten packs and in
 * `useFieldTranslation.ts`; the parity test fails on the first, and
 * `all-locales-key-parity.test.ts` on the second.
