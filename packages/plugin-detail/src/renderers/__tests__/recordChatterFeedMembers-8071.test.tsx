 * `record:chatter.feed` / `record:discussion.feed` — the nested config's
 * MEMBER shape, and the fact that authoring it REPLACES (objectui#8071)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The per-block member pin objectui#8068 asks for on these two keys. They are
 * ONE key on ONE renderer: `record:chatter` and `record:discussion` are the
 * same `RecordChatterRenderer` registered under two names against the same
 * `CHATTER_INPUTS`, so one file pins both — the shape
 * `record-picker-label-placeholder-i18n.test.tsx` already set for a pair of
 * keys covered by a single mechanism (objectui#8071 slice 3).
 *
 * `feed` is declared a bare `type: 'object'` in the registration, and its
 * member list is the SPEC's: `@objectstack/spec` declares
 * `RecordChatterProps.feed: RecordActivityProps.optional()`
 * (`component.zod.ts:1366`), bound to both names. The only prior coverage,
 * `record-chatter.loading.test.tsx` (read end to end before this file was
 * written), is about the host's `loading` signal reaching the panel and never
 * authors `feed` at all.
 *
 * ## The member fact that matters most: authoring `feed` REPLACES it
 *
 * `record-chatter.tsx` composes its config as
 *
 *     { position, collapsible, feed: {DEFAULTS}, ...(schema) }
 *
 * — a SHALLOW spread. So an authored `feed` does not merge with the renderer's
 * three defaults (`enableReactions` / `enableThreading` / `showCommentInput`,
 * all true), it displaces them wholesale, and every member the author did not
 * restate falls back to `RecordActivityTimeline`'s own `?? false`. An author
 * who writes `feed: { showCommentInput: true }` meaning "and keep the rest"
 * turns reactions and threading OFF. That is the whole reason this key needs a
 * member pin rather than a presence check, and it is asserted below in both
 * directions rather than described here.
 *
 * ## WHICH members of `feed` are live on this path
 *
 * `config.feed` reaches `RecordActivityTimeline`, which reads the five
 * AFFORDANCE members (`showFilterToggle`, `showCommentInput`,
 * `enableReactions`, `enableThreading`, `showSubscriptionToggle`) at
 * `:213-217`. The four FILTER members (`types` / `limit` / `showCompleted` /
 * `unifiedTimeline`) are applied by `applyFeedConfig`, which
 * `renderers/record-chatter.tsx` now runs before handing items to the panel,
 * with `record-activity.tsx:219`'s call shape — so they are live here too
 * (objectui#8934). Their behaviour is pinned next door in
 * `recordChatterFeedMembersLive-8934.test.tsx`; this file stays on the
 * displacement fact above.
 *
 * ⚠️ RE-POINTED TWICE, and the second time reversed the first — worth stating
 * because the two versions read the same evidence and disagreed. This section
 * once recorded the filter members as inert on this path and treated that as
 * the key's shape; objectui#8934 first proposed narrowing the registration to
 * match, and that route was overturned on a maintainer principle: the protocol
 * is the contract, documentation follows the implementation, and a protocol
 * that is wrong is changed in `@objectstack/spec` first. Since the spec
 * declares the whole `RecordActivityProps` shape here, the inertness was an
 * IMPLEMENTATION GAP, and it was closed in the renderer rather than written
 * into the contract.
 *
 * ⚠️ Two members of the declared shape are still unread on this path and are
 * NOT closed by that pipeline: `filterMode` (taken by the timeline as a
 * component prop, `:187` / `:212`, never off `config`) and `enableMentions`
 * (whose only reads are on the `record:activity` path). Tracked as
 * objectui#8968; ⛔ neither is pinned here, in either direction.
 *
 * ## Resolution
 *
 * Nothing resolves through any `dist/`: `../record-chatter` is this package's
 * own source and `@object-ui/react` is mapped to its `src` by the root
 * `vitest.config.mts` alias table, so an ablation of `record-chatter.tsx` is
 * visible here without a rebuild.
