/**
 * No layout renderer puts an authored schema prop on the DOM (objectui#5574).
 *
 * ## What this measures that the sweep gate cannot
 *
 * `packages/app-shell/src/__tests__/widget-dom-leak-sweep.test.tsx` is the gate
 * for this class, and it is the stronger instrument for the OPEN TAIL: it plants
 * canary keys no schema declares (`zzcanary`, a flattened `props` container, an
 * injected adapter) on one node per registered type. What it does not plant are
 * the renderer's OWN DECLARED PROPS — its canary node authors no `align`, no
 * `gap`, no `padding`. Adding them there would rewrite the measured attribute set
 * of all 115 renderers still ledgered, i.e. destroy the arrival reading that file
 * exists to preserve.
 *
 * So the declared-prop half is measured HERE instead, at catalog scale, on real
 * authored nodes. That is not a hypothetical distinction: every one of the 1194
 * attributes objectui#5574 measured was a DECLARED prop being consumed off
 * `schema` AND forwarded to the element — `align`, `gap`, `justify`, `direction`,
 * `padding`, `maxWidth`, `content`, `value`. A regression that re-spread only the
 * declared keys would pass the sweep gate and fail here.
 *
 * ## The reading this pins
 *
 * Before the fix, rendering every catalog node of these five types through the
 * real `SchemaRenderer` and reading the DOM:
 *
 *     text[content]      522     container[padding]   14
 *     flex[align]        198     container[maxwidth]   6
 *     flex[gap]          193     flex[direction]       5
 *     stack[gap]         153     stack[align]          4
 *     flex[justify]       98     text[value]           1
 *                                              TOTAL 1194
 *
 * `grid` read ZERO in that same run, across 26 nodes, because objectui#4787 /
 * PR #5573 had already converged it on `toDomProps`. That is what made the
 * reading trustworthy rather than merely alarming — a fixed renderer read clean
 * and its unfixed siblings did not, so the instrument was demonstrably not blind.
 *
 * ## Designing against the failure mode this test could have
 *
 * A zero here means nothing on its own: a renderer that renders NOTHING spreads
 * nothing and reads clean, and so does a walk that found no nodes. Both are how
 * a broken instrument reports a healthy tree. Two guards, and they are the
 * reason this file is not just an `expect([]).toEqual([])`:
 *
 *   1. NODE COUNTS are asserted, per type, against the census below. If the
 *      catalog grows this fails and the number gets updated; if the walk breaks,
 *      or a renderer starts returning `null`, it fails and cannot read as clean.
 *   2. The JUDGE is self-checked against a deliberately leaking element, so a
 *      zero can never come from an attribute reader that reports nothing.
 *
 * The 159 `text` nodes that render NO element are recorded rather than hidden:
 * `text` returns a bare fragment when a node carries neither designer id,
 * className, `variant` nor `align`, and 159 catalog nodes take that path. They
 * were never evidence of safety, which is the phantom-clean class
 * objectui#5574's first pass found seven real leaks behind. (176 before
 * objectui#6942 taught `ui:text` to read `variant` and `align`: a node that
 * authors either now needs an element to carry the class, so 13 of them left
 * this class for the measured one.)
 *
 * Module-scope import of `@object-ui/components`, not `beforeAll` (AGENTS.md
 * §测试纪律): registering the renderers is an unbounded module load and must not
 * be billed to a bounded hook timeout.

  // 162 -> 159 with objectui#7444, the same move one card later: the three
  // `components-basic-text/text-with-colors` nodes authored a phantom `color`

  // DOES forward — so each one needs an element to carry its colour class.

  // move by exactly five. Catalog authoring, not a renderer change.
  // 696 -> 698 with objectui#6877: `components-basic-div/use-box-instead` is
  // the `div` -> `box` before/after the migration guide was missing, and its
  // two `text` nodes both carry a className, so both need an element — the
  // no-element count is unmoved. Catalog authoring, not a renderer change.

  // `fields-grid/line-items-grid` fixture's `product` grid column is
