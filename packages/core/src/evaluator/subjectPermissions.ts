/**
 * The acting subject's effective object permissions, carried to the one place
 * this repo hands a predicate to the CEL engine (objectui#4421).
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * `@objectstack/formula` registers `current_user.can(object, verb)` as a
 * receiver method on the acting subject, and answers it from
 * `EvalContext.permissions` — the verbatim `objects` map of the
 * `/auth/me/permissions` response. That map is a separate field of the engine
 * context, and the engine is explicit that it is ⛔ NOT a CEL variable: an
 * authored predicate must not be able to read `permissions.crm_lead.allowEdit`
 * and step around the closed verb table.
 *
 * This repo's evaluation seam (`evalFieldPredicate`) is not handed an engine
 * context by its callers, though. Every action surface — the row menu, the
 * record header, the `action:*` renderers, `DeclaredActionsBar` — hands it a
 * variable BAG (the host's predicate scope, spread, merged, pushed through an
 * `ExpressionContext`), and the bag's string keys all become CEL roots. So the
 * permissions cannot ride on the bag under a name: any name would be a root.
 *
 * They ride on the SUBJECT instead, under a symbol:
 *
 *  - The engine models the map as the subject's own answer sheet — it binds
 *    `permissions` only alongside a user, and `can` refuses any receiver that
 *    is not that user (`receiver !== subject`). The subject is the one object
 *    every bag already carries by reference under `current_user` (and the
 *    `user` / `ctx.user` / `os.user` aliases of it), through every spread and
 *    every `ExpressionContext` scope, so no surface needs its own copy of the
 *    hand-off.
 *  - A symbol is the one kind of key no predicate dialect can name: CEL
 *    identifiers and member names are strings, and so are the legacy
 *    evaluator's. `current_user.permissions` still faults as an unknown key.
 *
 * ## Absent is not empty
 *
 * A subject that carries NO map — the payload has not loaded, no permission
 * provider is mounted, or the provider has no `/auth/me/permissions` answer at
 * all — hands the engine no `permissions`, and `can` then refuses loudly
 * (`ok: false`, `kind: 'runtime'`). That refusal is a FAULT, so each surface
 * applies its own fault policy to it; it is never turned into a quiet `false`
 * here, because the engine's contract is that an empty map means "holds
 * nothing" and a caller that has no data must not claim it has that answer.
