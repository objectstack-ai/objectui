 * objectui#6110 — `WizardForm`'s SUBMIT-TIME required re-check binds the host
 * predicate scope, so `current_user` resolves there the way it already does in
 * the form renderer (`packages/components/src/renderers/form/form.tsx`, #6010).
 *
 * ## What was broken, and why it is worse than a render-path gap
 *
 * `missingRequiredByStep` is not a render path. It re-checks the WHOLE declared
 * field set at final submit, because `allowSkip` lets the user jump past a step
 * whose fields were therefore never mounted, never registered and never
 * validated. Its own docstring states the contract it is built to keep:
 *
 *   > "the same one the form renderer and the server's rule-validator use, so a
 *   > conditionally required/hidden field gets the same verdict from all three
 *   > rather than a second, divergent dialect."
 *
 * Since #6010 the form renderer's verdict binds `current_user` and this gate's
 * did not — so the wizard would HIDE a field from a user (predicate false, with
 * the scope bound) and then, at submit, count that same field as visible
 * (predicate faults open, with no scope) and refuse the submit on a control the
 * submitter can neither see nor fill in. A dead end, with the wizard navigating
 * to a step that shows nothing missing.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Both fallback directions are exercised, on purpose
 *
 * `visibleWhen` / `visibleOn` fail OPEN (`fallback: true`), so an unbound scope
 * makes a field MORE visible and blocks the submit. `requiredWhen` fails CLOSED
 * (`fallback: false`), so an unbound scope makes a field LESS required and lets
 * an invalid create through. Asserting only one direction would leave the pin
 * satisfiable by whichever fallback happened to line up; asserting both is what
 * makes this a measurement of the BINDING rather than of a default.
 *
 * The observable in every case is whether `dataSource.create` was called —
 * i.e. whether the gate let the submit through — because that IS the harm the
 * card names, and it is not reachable by an "is it on screen" assertion: the
 * blocking field is on a step the user skipped and never renders either way.
