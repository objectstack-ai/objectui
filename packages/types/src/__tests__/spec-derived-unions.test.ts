/**
 * Hand-written unions that shadowed a spec vocabulary. (#2944, #2901)
 *
 * `spec-subschema-parity.test.ts` pins zod schemas by REFERENCE, which is the
 * strongest possible check — a faithful copy fails, because a copy is a fork.
 * TS type aliases cannot be pinned that way: they erase at runtime, and a
 * restated union that happens to match is indistinguishable from a derived one.
 *
 * So these assert the runtime vocabulary instead, which is what a restated union
 * would have drifted from. Each of these WAS drifted:
 *
 *  - `ChartType` carried 7 of the spec's 19 values. Because the sibling zod
 *    schema was re-exported under the spec's own symbol name, #2901 was filed
 *    reading this copy as the protocol and concluding the renderer had outgrown
 *    it — the premise was backwards.
 *  - `ReportType` was missing `joined`.
 *  - `ActionType` was missing `form`, under a doc comment claiming to be "the
 *    canonical definition from @objectstack/spec". `ActionRunner.executeForm`
 *    implements it, so a host app typing against @object-ui/types got an error
 *    on working code.
 *
 * The `satisfies` checks below ARE enforcement — but only since #3009 added
 * `packages/types/tsconfig.test.json` and chained it from this package's
 * `type-check` script.
 *
 * For the whole interval before that they were decorative, and an earlier version
 * of this comment asserting they were "the real enforcement" was simply false:
 * `tsconfig.json` excludes test files (it is the package build, with `rootDir`,
 * `composite` and `declaration`, so tests would emit into dist), and no other
 * `tsc` invocation read this file. Measured at the time: reverting a derived alias
 * to its old hand-written fork produced ZERO type errors. It now produces
 * `TS1360` pointing at the `satisfies` line below.
 *
 * The runtime assertions further down are still the stronger check for anything
 * with a runtime witness — a type alias erases, so only reference identity
 * distinguishes a re-export from a faithful copy. Keep both.
 *
 * Two cases are the inverse: `navigation` and `combo` are names objectui uses
 * that the spec does NOT have. Each is asserted absent from the spec, so that
 * the day the spec adopts one, this file fails and names the local thing to
 * retire.

// DIFFERENT reasons — none of which is the one the ledger recorded. Measured in the
// BUILT dist at spec 17.2.0 (source and issue state were both insufficient: the
// whole point of this ledger is that dist erasure is invisible from either):
//
//  - `JoinNode`            — the spec no longer exports the symbol AT ALL
//                            (TS2305 from `/ui` and `/data`); spec 17.0.0 retired
//                            the cluster. Nothing upstream to bind to. Absence
//                            pinned in `report-chart-query-spec-parity.test.ts`.
//  - `NavigationItem`      — upstream IS precise now (`IsAny` and `IsUnknown` both

//                            unaffected by it. `any` was never the only blocker —
//                            #3177 established that, and it still holds.
//  - `NavigationItemSchema`— upstream IS precise now; pinned below. The live
//                            blocker is SHAPE, and it is a RUNTIME one: see
//                            `navigation-spec-parity.test.ts`.
//  - `JoinedReportBlock`   — STILL erased, to `unknown`, by a cause #4171 never
//                            covered. Pinned in
//                            `report-chart-query-spec-parity.test.ts`.
//
// So the batch burns down to zero re-exports and the ledger's remaining debt is
// now carried as state pins that name their own release condition, rather than as
// a card pointing at an upstream issue that has since closed without settling it.
// ⛔ A closed upstream issue is not a licence to re-export: prove the dist type is
// precise, then prove binding it does not narrow what this package already accepts.

/**
 * Admission probes for `NavigationItem` and `FormField` (#3177).
 *
 * ## What these used to be, and why they were replaced
 *
 * `NavigationItem`, `JoinNode` and `FormField` used to collide with a spec
 * export whose own declaration resolved to `any` (the spec annotated the
 * recursive schemas behind them as `z.ZodType<any>`, and `z.infer` of that is
 * `any`). Binding objectui's local interface to that would have replaced a
 * precise, documented shape with `any` — a type-safety regression wearing a
 * burn-down's clothes — so they stayed local, and two `IsAny` pins asserted the
 * premise held. Filed upstream as objectstack#4171.
 *
 * Spec 17.0.0-rc.1 typed both properly and the `IsAny` pins fired. The #3177
 * triage then measured what the burn-down they demanded would actually cost —
 * and found that **`any` was never the only blocker for either symbol**, so
 * "no longer `any`" was never the right admission question. `IsAny` going
 * `false` proves the spec type is no longer EMPTY; it says nothing about
 * whether it is PRECISE enough to bind, which is what the burn-down needs.
 *
 * So the probes below ask the real question instead, one blocker per line. Each
 * asserts the CURRENT state (so this file is green today) and stops compiling
 * the day that specific blocker lifts — at which point that line names exactly
 * what became derivable. `JoinNode` needs none of this: spec 17.0.0 retired the
 * symbol (framework#4286), so there is no collision left to reason about.
 *
 * ## Why not simply compare the two types
 *
 * Mutual assignability lies here, in three separate ways, all of them present
 * in this repo (the list is `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs`'s):
 * `any` answers every `extends` question affirmatively; so does `unknown` on
 * one side; and objectui's `FormField` carries `[key: string]: any`, which
 * absorbs any member the spec has and makes the two compare equal while they
 * accept wildly different objects. A structural `extends` ALSO silently permits
 * excess properties, so it cannot see that the spec declares no `pinned`. Hence
 * per-key, per-tier probes rather than one verdict.
