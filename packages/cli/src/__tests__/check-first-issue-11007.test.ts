/**
 * `objectui check` names what it refused, and never calls a file it did not
 * validate passed (objectui#11007).
 *
 * Measured before this change, on the card's own two documents:
 *
 * - A root `object-map` whose `map` block carries the typo `latitudeFieId`
 *   was listed under "did not validate" as `map.json (type "object-map")`.
 *   The validator's issue — `Unrecognized key: "latitudeFieId"` at `map` —
 *   was already in hand and was thrown away, so the list named the file and
 *   not the key.
 * - The same node one level down, under a page's `children`, was admitted on
 *   the `children` key alone and never parsed. The run ended
 *   「✓ All checks passed」 over it.
 *
 * The triage ruling on the card chose both halves, narrowly: print the first
 * issue for what `check` already parses, and make the closing line say what
 * was actually established. ⛔ It ruled out giving `check` a nested walk of its
 * own — the verdict is `objectui validate`'s — and the third block below pins
 * that boundary, so a walk added later turns red here and sends its author to
 * the ruling.
 *
 * Expected text is derived from the command's own `describeFirstIssue` and
 * `closingLine`, fed from `safeValidateSchema`'s real issues, rather than
 * copied here as literals. What the assertions hold by hand is the SUBJECT:
 * the refused key, the path it sits at, and the counts.
 *
 * Fixtures live under `os.tmpdir()`, never in the repo tree: `check()` globs
 * every JSON file under the directory it is handed, so a fixture committed
 * inside this workspace would be scanned by every other run of the command,
 * the repo's own `pnpm check` included.
