/**
 * objectui#8285 — `ObjectKanbanSchema.quickAdd` RETIRED on the `object-kanban`
 * arm, on BOTH faces (director-seat ruling B, decision batch #91, 2026-09-08).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The key was declared on both faces and on `@objectstack/spec`'s
 * `ComponentPropsMap['object-kanban']`, and it drew nothing: the Quick Add
 * control is gated on `quickAdd` AND a host-supplied `onQuickAdd` function, and
 * an object-bound board supplies none. The ruling retired the key rather than
 * grow a record-creation write path on the board; the spec half landed in
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.5.0 as a tombstone, and this is the mirror half.
 *
 * ## Why a TOMBSTONE rather than a deleted member
 *
 * `BaseSchema`'s mirror ends `.passthrough()` (and the interface carried
 * `[key: string]: any` until objectui#8347), so a deleted member is KEPT, not
 * refused, on the zod face. The member stays
 * declared and unwritable: `?: never` on the interface, `retirementTombstone()`
 * on the mirror — the `allowCollapse` shape next door
 * (`object-kanban-allow-collapse-retired-8801.test.ts`). "The near miss" below
 * is what separates the two outcomes on one instrument.
 *
 * The renderer half — `ObjectKanban` no longer forwards the key, and
 * `KanbanRenderer` keeps the pair for a React host — is pinned in
 * `@object-ui/plugin-kanban`'s `quickAddRetiredNotForwarded-8285.test.tsx`.
