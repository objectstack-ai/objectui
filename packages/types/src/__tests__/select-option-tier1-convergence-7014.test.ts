/**
 * The two named select-option faces are ONE declaration now, and converging
 * them narrowed nothing (objectui#7014, Q1).
 *
 * ## What changed
 *
 * `SelectOptionMetadata` (`../field-types`, the object-metadata read model) and
 * `SelectOption` (`../form`, the SDUI form vocabulary) each restated the
 * select-option vocabulary by hand. Both now extend `SelectOptionBase`
 * (`../select-option`), which derives the spec's keys from
 * `@objectstack/spec/data` BY REFERENCE and writes out only the divergences.
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and why each half is needed
 *
 * A convergence has exactly two ways to go wrong, and they fail in opposite
 * directions, so neither half can stand alone:
 *
 *   1. **It narrows something.** A "unification" quietly drops a key one face
 *      had, or tightens a member's type, and every literal that used the
 *      dropped key becomes an excess-property error somewhere else. The
 *      `PRE_CONVERGENCE_*` types below are the two faces' member lists AS THEY
 *      STOOD BEFORE, written out by hand from the declarations, and each is
 *      asserted INVARIANTLY equal to what the converged face resolves to today.
 *      `Equal`, not `extends`: a one-way check passes on a narrowing.
 *
 *   2. **It widens past the authoring contract without saying so.** The
 *      objectui faces are deliberately WIDER than the spec — that is the point
 *      of the dialect keys — but only the runtime READ model may be wider.
 *      The runtime block asserts the spec still refuses every dialect key BY
 *      NAME, each refusal behind a control that accepts the same document minus
 *      the key, so a red here reads "the key's status changed" and never "the
 *      fixture drifted".
 *
 * The one deliberate widening this convergence DOES make is `default` on the
 * object-metadata face: it is a spec key that face could not describe before,
 * ruled `enforce` on the object-field face (objectstack#7246), and it arrives
 * as an OPTIONAL key, so every document that face accepted before it is still
 * accepted. It is asserted below rather than left implicit.
 *
 * ## ⭐ What `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 changed here, and why nothing was edited
 *
 * 17.3.0 adopted `SelectOptionSchema.description` (maintainer ruling
 * 2026-08-25 on objectui#6140 / objectui#6153, Option A). `SelectOptionBase`
 * derives the spec's keys BY REFERENCE, so the key arrived on BOTH faces with
 * no edit to `../select-option` at all — which is exactly the property the
 * derivation exists to have, and it is worth saying out loud that the pins
 * below moved while the type did not.
 *
 * Two consequences are written into the assertions rather than left implicit:
 *
 *   1. The FORM face gained a member it never declared, so its
 *      pre-convergence equality became a SET DIFFERENCE — the same idiom the
 *      object-metadata face has used for `default` since the convergence. A
 *      plain `Equal` there would now have to be repaired every time the spec
 *      grows, which is the hand-copy failure this file exists to prevent.
 *   2. The two faces no longer differ on `description` — it is inherited on
 *      both — so the "differ on exactly `value`" assertion states that
 *      directly instead of excusing `description` from the comparison.
 *
 * The runtime half moved the same way: `description` is asserted ACCEPTED, and
 * `disabled` / `icon` carry the refusal half so a schema that had gone
 * permissive cannot pass this file.
 *
 * ## The control the spec fixtures need
 *
 * A select option's `value` is a lowercase machine identifier with a minimum
 * length, so a one-character value fails `too_small` and NOT for the reason a
 * key-boundary fixture is asking about. Every fixture here uses a value long
 * enough that the only thing under test is the key set, and the accepting
 * control proves it.
