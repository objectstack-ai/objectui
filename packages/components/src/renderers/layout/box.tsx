/**
 * `box` — the neutral block container (objectui#3965).
 *
 * Minted by the 2026-08-29 maintainer ruling (方案 A) because the vocabulary
 * had no class-transparent block box, which is why the deprecated `div` could
 * never retire from the JSON surface: every replacement the deprecation notice
 * names injects layout of its own (`container` adds width/centering/padding,
 * `flex`/`stack` add a display mode and gaps, `grid` adds `grid-cols-*`,
 * `card` adds border/shadow AND wraps children in a `CardContent` element —
 * all measured through the real `SchemaRenderer`, recorded in
 * `examples/schema-catalog/test/deprecated-component-types.test.ts`).
 *
 * The contract, all three clauses from the ruling, pinned in
 * `../__tests__/box-neutral-container.test.tsx`:
 *
 *   1. renders `children`;
 *   2. the authored `className` passes through VERBATIM;
 *   3. zero injected classes — no `cn()` merge, no default class, nothing.
 *
 * This renderer reads `children` ONLY, and since objectui#6771 retired the
 * `body` dialect every other renderer does too — `box` is no longer the
 * exception it was written as. The hazard it was minted against was `div`'s
 * `children || body` fallback, which made a mechanical `div`→X swap unsafe
 * (four catalog fixtures authored `body` and would have lost their content
 * silently, with an unchanged element count). That fallback is retired; the
 * one spelling is now the protocol's, not just this renderer's.
