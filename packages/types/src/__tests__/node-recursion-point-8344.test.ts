/**
 * The node recursion point resolves per-type, at every depth (objectui#8344).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * Every child slot (`body`, `children`, and every per-component redeclaration of
 * them) is `z.union([SchemaNodeSchema, z.array(SchemaNodeSchema)])`, and
 * `SchemaNodeSchema`'s component arm was `BaseSchemaCore` — the ~21 base keys and
 * NOTHING type-specific. ⇒ per-type enforcement was ROOT-ONLY, at every depth, for
 * every component type. objectui#7869 recorded it as an ASYMMETRY, measured there:
 * an off-spec node was refused standing alone and ACCEPTED one slot down, inside
 * any parent. #8344 points the arm at `AnyComponentSchema` instead.
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and why each leg is here
 *
 * The headline is one behaviour — "the same node gets the same verdict at every
 * depth" — and a single assertion cannot state it, because BOTH halves of an
 * asymmetry have to be read to say the asymmetry is gone. So #7869's reproduction
 * is pinned in both directions (refused alone AND refused nested), against a
 * NON-VACUITY leg (the legal twin of the same node, accepted at both depths) that
 * would catch the way this could pass while being broken — a recursion point that
 * refuses everything reads as a fixed asymmetry and is a dead contract.
 *
 * The fourth leg is what makes it a test of the REDIRECT rather than of `icon`:
 * a node whose `type` resolves in no arm of `AnyComponentSchema`. `BaseSchemaCore`
 * accepts any object with a string `type`, so that node is the one input the two
 * candidate recursion points disagree about MOST — it separates "the arm is the
 * component union" from "the arm is the base shape" without reading a single zod
 * internal.
 *
 * ⚠️ Recognising the recursion point by IDENTITY is pinned on the EXPORTED WRAPPER,
 * ⛔ never through `.unwrap()` or a re-invoked `z.lazy` getter. That is objectui#7918
 * consequence ①: the exported wrapper identity is stable and survives through a
 * declared slot, and it is the ONE reading that holds for all ten recursive mirrors.
 *
 * ⚠️ ⛔ Do not read that as "`unwrap()` and the getter are unstable HERE". On `main` they are
 * — measured on the built face, `S.unwrap() === S.unwrap()` and `getter() === getter()` are
 * both FALSE. On THIS head both are TRUE for this one const, because the redirect builds the
 * node union once below `BaseSchemaCore` and the getter returns it: the row moves to
 * `MEMOISED` in `zod-lazy-getter-identity-7918.test.ts`, as a byproduct rather than a goal.
 * The `fill is LIVE` leg below works BECAUSE of that.
 *
 * ⇒ the discipline stands unchanged and for an unchanged reason: it must hold for
 * the seven mirrors that are still TDZ_BOUND, so a pin written through `.unwrap()`
 * or a re-invoked getter would compare two fresh objects THERE and fail for a
 * reason that has nothing to do with this contract. Pinning the wrapper is what
 * makes this file portable to them; it is not a claim about this const's getter.
