 *
 * objectui#7780 — `ObjectKanbanSchema.objectName` becomes a PRESENCE RULE on
 * both faces: at least one of `bind`, `data`, `objectName`.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `packages/plugin-kanban/src/ObjectKanban.tsx` — the component the
 * `object-kanban` registration renders — resolves its rows in four steps:
 *
 *     const boundData = useDataScope(schema.bind);
 *     if (schema.objectName && !boundData && !schema.data) { …fetch… }
 *     const rawData = (hasExternalData ? externalData : undefined)
 *                     || boundData || schema.data || fetchedData;
 *
 * — the pre-fetched `data` PROP, then `bind`, then the inline ROW ARRAY on
 * `schema.data`, and only then a fetch keyed by `schema.objectName`. Every
 * `objectName` read is guarded. Yet both published faces REQUIRED
 * `objectName`, so a `bind`-only or `data`-only board — which renders today —
 * was refused by `ObjectKanbanSchema.safeParse` and by `safeValidateSchema`,
 * and could not be annotated with its own type. Measured on `origin/main`
 * `fff250ff`, both entry paths, pristine dist:
 *
 *     bind only        -> refused at `objectName` (invalid_type)
 *     data only        -> refused at `objectName` (invalid_type)
 *     objectName only  -> accepted
 *     none of the three-> refused at `objectName` (invalid_type)
 *
 * This file pins the post-fix vector — accepted / accepted / accepted /
 * refused ON THE REFINEMENT — and, more to the point, WHY each verdict is what
 * it is.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ NOT the map / gantt / calendar ladder, and that is a boundary
 *
 * objectui#6939 (map, gantt) and objectui#7313 (calendar) fixed the SAME defect
 * CLASS on a DIFFERENT ladder: `data` as a `ViewData` PROVIDER BLOCK →
 * `staticData` → `objectName`, resolved by the shared
 * `resolveRecordSourceConfig` in `@object-ui/core`, refined by
 * `requireRecordSource`. This board:
 *
 *   - has NO `staticData` rung;
 *   - reads `data` as a RAW ROW ARRAY, directly, not through any resolver;
 *   - HAS a `bind` rung the other three never walk;
 *   - calls `resolveRecordSourceConfig` / `getDataConfig` ZERO times.
 *
 * So the predicate is `requireKanbanRecordSource`, written for this ladder, and
 * the last two `it`s below are the CONTROL that keeps it that way: objectui#7651
 * ("Should `ObjectKanban` get a real record-source ladder?") was ruled B and
 * closed `not_planned` on 2026-09-05, refusing a sixth `getDataConfig` producer,
 * a `ViewData` retype of `data`, and a `staticData` rung. This card moved ONE
 * thing — the requiredness of `objectName` — and this file fails if a later
 * change quietly adds a rung under the same heading.
 *
 * ## `groupBy` was untouched HERE — and was moved later, by objectui#8990
 *
 * objectui#7322 / PR #7774 made `groupBy` the REQUIRED lane key. Its
 * requiredness measurement deliberately EXCLUDED two readings from counting as
 * a lane-less mode: the `dataSource` json fragment in
 * `content/docs/utilities/data-objectstack.mdx`, and `ListView.tsx`'s
 * runtime-generated node. A presence rule over `bind` / `data` / `objectName`
 * must not incidentally overturn that, so the `groupBy` half of the vector was
 * asserted here alongside the record-source half — as a CONTROL on this card's
 * blast radius, not as an endorsement of the requiredness.
 *
 * ⚠️ objectui#8990 then overturned it deliberately: `@objectstack/spec` declares
 * `groupBy: z.string().optional()`, so requiring it made this package refuse a
 * document the protocol accepts. Those two excluded readings turned out to be
 * the corpus evidence — a documented board and a node this repo's own
 * `ListView` emits, both lane-less, both refused. The `groupBy` half of the
 * vector below is therefore INVERTED, and it now carries the sharper assertion:
 * a lane-less board is accepted, while a SOURCE-less one is still refused AT
 * THE REFINEMENT. Keeping the refusal PATH in the assertion is what stops the
 * record-source rule this card exists for from decaying into a bare
 * `success === false` that any reason could satisfy.
