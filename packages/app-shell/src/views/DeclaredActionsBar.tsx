/**
 * DeclaredActionsBar — render + execute an object's SERVER-DECLARED actions for
 * a single record at a given location, with ZERO per-action host code.
 *
 * A bespoke page (e.g. the approvals inbox) that already has a record in hand
 * can drop this bar in to surface the actions the backend declares on that
 * object (`objectDef.actions[]`) — filtered to a `location`
 * (`record_section`, `record_header`, …) and each action's `visible` CEL —
 * and have them execute through the *same* console action runtime ObjectView /
 * RecordDetailView use: confirm dialogs, param-collection dialogs, result
 * dialogs, the authenticated api/flow/server handlers, and refresh-after.
 *
 * It is fully self-contained: it fetches the object definition through the
 * metadata provider (unless `actions` is passed explicitly), resolves the
 * `dataSource` from the adapter, and mounts its own `ActionProvider` +
 * runtime dialogs. Each button dispatches the declared action with the record
 * stashed under `params._rowRecord`, exactly the shape ObjectGrid row actions
 * and RelatedRecordActionsBridge use — so a `type:'api'` action whose target is
 * `/api/v1/approvals/requests/{id}/approve` resolves `{id}` from the record and
 * POSTs with any collected params (comment, to, …).
 *
 * Degrades gracefully: no matching declared actions → renders nothing.

/**
 * The located set, capability-gated — and the toolbar it draws.
 *
 * ## Why this is a component at all, and why it lives HERE
 *
 * [ADR-0066 D4 / objectui#9572] `@objectstack/spec` declares
 * `requiredPermissions` as "enforced with 403 on the platform action route …
 * and mirrored as a UI hide". This bar filters its own action list instead of
 * routing through `ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation`, so the engine's gate
 * never reached it and the declared key was INERT on every action it draws —
 * the one object-bound surface that did not mirror it, after `action:bar`, the
 * grid row menu, the selection bar and (objectui#9623) the data-table row menu.
 *
 * ⛔ A UI MIRROR of a decision the SERVER still enforces, and nothing more.
 * Unknown capabilities fail OPEN (see `useCapabilityGate`), an EMPTY held set
 * means "holds nothing" and gates normally, and the request this bar sends is
 * byte-identical either way. ⛔ No enforcement moves into the console.
 *
 * ⭐ PLACEMENT is load-bearing. `useCapabilityGate` reads the nearest
 * `<ActionProvider>` ABOVE its caller, and this bar is self-contained: it
 * mounts its OWN provider, seeded by `useConsoleActionRuntime` with the same
 * `user.systemPermissions` the engine reads. Calling the gate in the bar's
 * outer body would therefore read a DIFFERENT provider — the host's, if it has
 * one at all — and in a standalone host would read none and fail open on every
 * action forever: a gate that compiles, reviews as correct, and mirrors
 * nothing. Evaluated here, under this bar's own provider, it mirrors exactly
 * the capabilities the dispatch it is about to make will carry.
 * `DeclaredActionsBar.capabilityGate-9572.test.tsx` supplies the held set
 * through that provider ALONE, so the outer placement fails it.
 *
 * ## Why ONCE, over the list
 *
 * The objectui#3562 invariant: the chrome and the items must read one filtered
 * source. Gating per button would leave a host holding a divider + section
 * label with nothing under it whenever the whole declared set is denied —
 * exactly the orphan divider `label` is documented never to produce.
 *
 * ## How it composes with the two gates already here
 *
 * `visible` (fail-CLOSED) and `disabled` are evaluated per button, downstream
 * of this filter, and the three are ANDed. The composition is therefore
 * MONOTONE: it can only ever hide more than before, never show something that
 * was hidden — which is what makes a fail-OPEN gate safe to put in front of a
 * fail-CLOSED one. The approvals `can_override` arm (objectui#5178) is
 * untouched by construction: `can_override` is a per-RECORD viewer flag an
 * action's own `visible` CEL reads, `requiredPermissions` is a per-CALLER
 * capability list, and `isOverrideDecision` still runs unchanged on every
 * action that survives. An override-only viewer gets no exemption from a
 * declared capability, and gets no new exposure either.
