// NOTE: Do NOT `import './index.css'` here.
//
// `index.css` is a standalone Tailwind v4 entry (`@import 'tailwindcss'`).
// In Vite library `build`, that import is extracted to `dist/index.css` and
// dropped from the JS bundle automatically — consumers explicitly load it
// via `@import '@object-ui/components/style.css'` (see README).
//
// In a pnpm monorepo dev server, however, the workspace package is resolved
// to its `src/`, so the import would be evaluated and Vite would inject a
// SECOND, partial Tailwind stylesheet (its `@source` only scans
// `packages/components/src`, missing every other package's classes). That
// second sheet is appended after the app's stylesheet, so any base utility
// it redeclares (e.g. `.inline-flex`) overrides media-query variants from
// the first sheet (e.g. `md:hidden`, `!top-14`) defined elsewhere — silently
// breaking responsive utilities and overrides used by `@object-ui/app-shell`,
// `@object-ui/auth`, etc.
//
// Apps must own the single Tailwind entrypoint and `@source`-scan every
// workspace package they consume (see `examples/console-starter/src/index.css`).
//
// We DO import `sidebar-fixes.css` below: it contains plain CSS overrides
// (no Tailwind directives) for shadcn sidebar utility classes that Tailwind
// v4 cannot compile correctly. Plain CSS is safe to inject from a workspace
// package because it doesn't trigger a second Tailwind build.

// The member-action visibility gate — "did this action DECLARE a `visible` gate
// at all?", the single definition objectui#3492 established and PR #3816 /
// #3825 / #3836 applied to every member-action gate in this package and in
// `plugin-grid`. Since objectui#3850 the answer is "normalization still leaves a
// condition to evaluate" (so an empty-`source` envelope is NOT a gate, where the
// older `!= null && !== ''` counted every object), and this name is a re-export
// of core's one definition, `hasDeclaredPredicate`.
//
// Exported because the family has a member OUTSIDE these packages: app-shell's
// `DeclaredActionsBar` mounts an object's server-declared actions as plain JSX
// (no `SchemaRenderer` in front, so its own gate is the only one on that path),
// and asked truthiness — `visible: false` rendered a live Approve/Reject button
// (objectui#3835). A re-export, not a copy: five gates in three packages asking
// one question must not drift into five answers, which is exactly the shape
// objectui#3142 had to unpick for `locations` in these same files. app-shell
// already depends on this package, so the direction costs nothing new.

// THE icon-name seam (objectui#5935) — `name -> LucideIcon | null`, one
// tokeniser and one rename map for the whole repo.
//
// Exported for the same reason `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate` above is: the family
// has members outside this package. Seven modules used to hand-roll this lookup
// with THREE different tokenisers and the `Home -> House` rename on only four of
// them, so the same authored name rendered on one surface and not another —
// `app-shell`'s ActionPreview, `plugin-detail`'s RelatedList, `plugin-list`'s
// ListView and TabBar, and `plugin-view`'s ViewSwitcher now import this one.
// All five already depend on this package, so the direction costs nothing new.
//
// ⛔ Nothing about the FALLBACK is exported, because there is none to export:
// the seam returns `null` and each surface keeps its own visible fallback
// (maintainer ruling 2026-09-03, objectui#5935, option C).
