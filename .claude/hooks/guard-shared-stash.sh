#!/usr/bin/env bash
# guard-shared-stash.sh — PreToolUse guard: the stash stack is SHARED across worktrees.
# Blocks Bash commands that push to / pop from / drop the shared stash stack, and lets
# the read-only and SHA-pinned forms through.
#
# Why: `git stash` keeps its stack in refs/stash inside the COMMON .git directory. Every
# linked worktree shares that one LIFO stack, so the per-task worktree isolation AGENTS.md
# mandates — and guard-main-checkout.sh enforces — does NOT extend to stash. Two agents
# stashing in their own worktrees operate on the same stack: A's pop restores whatever B
# pushed a moment earlier, and A's own changes stay on the stack for B to take.
#
# Live incident, objectui#3430 (2026-08-06, ~03:56Z): a reverse-verification
# `git stash push -- packages/fields/.../RecordPickerDialog.tsx` followed by
# `git stash pop` dropped b52e3aa instead — another agent's WIP on claude/issue-5733-…,
# two unrelated plugin-detail files. Both agents' in-flight work swapped places; a
# `git add -A` on either side would have merged the other's changes into the wrong PR.
# The failure mode is maximally confusing: pop reports SUCCESS, and someone else's files
# simply appear in your git status. Reverse verification is routine here and stash is the
# handiest tool for it, so the collision probability is not small.
#
# Alternatives — no shared state, all three work inside your own worktree:
#   1. patch file       git diff > /tmp/wip.patch && git checkout -- <paths>
#                       git apply /tmp/wip.patch          (git apply -R to undo again)
#   2. temporary commit git commit -am wip                (git reset --soft HEAD~1)
#   3. a second worktree for the comparison checkout
#
# Allowed through, deliberately:
#   - `git stash list` / `git stash show`  — read-only, they never mutate the stack.
#   - `git stash create`  — writes a commit object and prints its object id WITHOUT
#     storing it in the ref namespace (git-stash(1)); the safe primitive underneath the
#     SHA-pinned workflow.
#   - `git stash apply <sha>` / `git stash store <sha>` — the recovery path used to repair
#     the incident above. An explicit hex object id ONLY: stash@{0} is a POSITION in the
#     shared stack and may be another agent's entry by the time your command runs.
#
# Deliberate exception (you know the stack is yours alone): OS_ALLOW_STASH=1.
#
# Exit-code contract, mirroring guard-main-checkout.sh: 0 = allow, 2 = block with the
# reason on stderr. Anything this cannot parse fails OPEN — a guard that blocks work it
# does not understand gets disabled, and then it guards nothing.
#
# Known boundary, stated so nobody has to rediscover it: the check reads the FIRST WORD of
# each shell segment, so a wrapped invocation (bash -c '…', xargs, ssh host '…') is not
# caught. That is the deliberate trade — the target is the reflexive `git stash push` an
# agent reaches for mid-task, not a determined evader, and OS_ALLOW_STASH=1 already exists
# for anyone who means it. Widening it to string-match anywhere in the command would block
# every `grep "git stash"` run against this very file.
#
# Self-test (50 cases, no network, no build): .claude/hooks/guard-shared-stash.selftest.sh
# 50 = 46 `expect ` lines + 2 inline specials (empty-tool_input fail-open, no-jq fallback)
# + 2 hatch-message assertions (`lacks`/`says`, which are not `expect ` lines).
# Re-derive when the matrix changes: `grep -c '^expect ' <selftest>` + 4, and the run's own
# tail prints the total ("N passed, N failed") — keep this number equal to it.

# --- split the command into shell segments, honouring quotes ---------------------------
# A separator inside '…' or "…" does NOT split, so writing *about* the ban is never caught
# by the ban: `grep -n "cd x && git stash pop" AGENTS.md` stays one segment whose first
# word is grep. (objectstack#4890's lesson — the PR writing a rule must not trip it.)
#
# OUTSIDE quotes a backslash escapes the NEXT character, so an escaped `\"` opens no quoted
# region at all. Without a branch for it this pass read that `"` as OPENING a region that
# never closed, went inert for every separator behind it, collapsed the whole command into
# one segment whose head word was the harmless one, and waved a real `git stash` through as
# a mere argument of `echo`. That is a fail-OPEN in the backstop for the one rule whose
# breach silently corrupts ANOTHER agent's work (objectstack#11131, the same defect the
# sibling hook guard-main-checkout-bash.sh carried; objectui#6042).
#
# INSIDE "…" the rule inverts: there a backslash is special only before " \ $ ` , and an
# escaped `\"` is a literal quote that leaves the region OPEN. A pass that reads it as
# CLOSING goes outside quotes while bash is still inside, so separators behind it split
# where bash would not: the tail of a pure READ becomes a segment of its own, judged on its
# own head word — a false BLOCK on a command that touches no stash, which is exactly what
# the paragraph at the top of this section promises can never happen. The same gap fails
# OPEN in the other direction: once the escapes pair up the quoted region is left hanging
# and a real `git stash` behind it rides through as a mere argument. Inside '…' nothing is
# special, hence the q='"' gate. This is the in-quote half of the backslash rule, in the
# same shape and with the same escapee list as guard-main-checkout-bash.sh's
# split_segments() carries; that guard's `word` bookkeeping has no analogue here because
# this pass has no comment rule to track word starts for.

⛔ Blocked: git stash uses ONE stack shared by every worktree of this repo.
   command: $offending

refs/stash lives in the COMMON .git directory, so the per-task worktree isolation this
repo mandates does NOT cover the stash stack. Another agent's pop takes YOUR entry and
yours takes theirs — pop reports success and their files show up in your git status,
which is why objectui#3430 swapped two agents' in-flight changes without an error.

Use instead — no shared state, all inside your own worktree:
  1. patch file       git diff > /tmp/wip.patch && git checkout -- <paths>
                      git apply /tmp/wip.patch          # git apply -R to undo again
  2. temporary commit git commit -am wip                # git reset --soft HEAD~1
  3. a second worktree for the comparison checkout

Already allowed, no flag needed:
  git stash list | git stash show | git stash create
  git stash apply <sha> | git stash store <sha>    # literal hex id, never stash@{N}

Deliberate exception (the stack really is yours alone): set OS_ALLOW_STASH=1 in the
environment this hook itself runs in — a local settings "env" entry, or whatever this
agent process was started with. A VAR=1 prefix on a command sets it for that command
only, and this hook is not that command, so a prefix never reaches it.
