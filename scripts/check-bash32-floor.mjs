/**
 * The bash-3.2 floor, repo-wide (objectui#7692).
 *
 * ⚠️ PORTED from objectstack-ai/objectstack `scripts/check-bash32-floor.mjs` at
 * commit `6136293`, which is where the class, the construct table and the
 * exemption rules were worked out. This header states which claims are
 * upstream's and which were re-measured HERE; ⛔ do not read an inherited
 * measurement as a reading about this tree. REGISTERED in
 * `scripts/upstream-port-pin.json`; that entry carries the ref this copy was
 * taken at, its digest and every declared divergence, and the section "## The
 * drift gate over this port" below says what follows from it.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-bash32-floor.mjs
 *   node scripts/check-bash32-floor.mjs --self-test
 *
 * ## The class, and why CI is blind to it by construction
 *
 * Every shell script this repo ships runs under `/usr/bin/env bash`, and on
 * macOS that is bash 3.2.57 — Apple ships no bash 4+, for licensing reasons.
 * CI runs bash 5, where every bash-4-only construct works. So a bash-4 builtin
 * in a hand-run script is invisible to a normal green run: the defect AND its
 * repair both read as green, and the only reader who ever sees the failure is
 * an operator on a Mac, at the moment they most need the script to work.
 *
 * Two incidents, four sites, both found by hand and late:
 *
 *   - a release helper died at status 127 with `mapfile: command not found` as
 *     its ONLY output, so the warning it exists to print could not print;
 *   - the shared verify lock used `mapfile` and `EPOCHSECONDS`, where the 3.2
 *     symptom is worse than a crash: `EPOCHSECONDS` unbound leaves the deadline
 *     empty and turns a bounded wait into an unbounded spin.
 *
 * Both incidents are UPSTREAM's, and they are what established the class. A
 * sweep found and fixed all four sites there. Nothing stopped a fifth being
 * typed, in either repository.
 *
 * ## The coverage this repository had before this gate: none
 *
 * Measured on `origin/main` `28cfff4`, with a live control beside each zero —
 * a zero taken with no control is not a reading:
 *
 *   - tracked files whose name carries `bash32` / `bash-32` / `bash3`: 0.
 *     Control, same listing: 47 `scripts/check-*.mjs` gates exist. So the
 *     absence is the tree's, not the grep's.
 *   - the two neighbours that look closest are neither, by their own verdicts:
 *       `check-control-bytes` — "scanned 6443 tracked text file(s); skipped 85
 *         binary". It judges BYTES, in every text file, and says nothing about
 *         shell grammar.
 *       `check-shell-escape-residue` — "206 file(s) and 1309 fenced block(s)
 *         examined in total". Its population is markdown FENCES in `AGENTS.md`,
 *         `CLAUDE.md`, `skills`, `.claude/skills` and `content/docs`: prose
 *         about shell, not shell programs.
 *
 * Upstream additionally retains two FILE-SCOPED simulated runs that this
 * repository does not have (`enable -n mapfile readarray` via `BASH_ENV`, plus
 * `unset` of the bash-5 variables). That difference matters for what the
 * "Known limit" section below can promise, and it is stated there rather than
 * left to be discovered.
 *
 * ## What this gate is NOT
 *
 * ⛔ Upstream carries this scan as the THIRD leg beside those two simulated
 * runs, and its header forbids using it to retire them. Here there is no such
 * pair to retire — so the same sentence has to be read forwards instead: a
 * static scan sees parse-level constructs a simulated run cannot reach, and a
 * simulated run reaches constructs assembled at runtime that no static scan can
 * see. This repository now holds the first half only. ⛔ Do not read a green
 * verdict here as the coverage upstream's green verdict carries.
 *
 * ## The exemption rule: telling a HUNTER from a USER
 *
 * The hard part of a repo-wide scan is that the files which document this floor
 * have to NAME the constructs they refuse in order to explain why, and a
 * self-test hunting these tokens has to name them in order to hunt them. A scan
 * that cannot tell a mention from a use reddens itself on day one. Upstream met
 * exactly that: 8 findings there, every one a false positive, all in one file.
 *
 * ⚠️ Re-measured HERE, and the answer is different — recorded because carrying
 * upstream's number across would be inventing a reading. Over the 12 shell
 * files in this population, with E1 (full-line comments) AND E3 (command
 * position) both switched OFF, the 19 patterns match on **0 lines**. So on this
 * tree today the exemptions suppress NOTHING, and none of them is load-bearing
 * yet. They are carried anyway, and that is a decision rather than inertia:
 * the doctrine this repository is acquiring — this file, its wiring comment in
 * `.github/workflows/lint.yml`, and any hook that later refuses one of these
 * tokens — has to name the constructs in order to refuse them, which is the
 * arrangement that produced upstream's 8. An exemption rule invented on the day
 * it is first needed is invented under pressure to make a red gate green.
 *
 * So the rule is not "exempt these files" — an allowlist of filenames rots, and
 * a rotting allowlist is how this class survived. The rule is that an
 * occurrence is a USE unless the LINE ITSELF carries mechanical evidence that
 * it is not, and there are exactly three such pieces of evidence:
 *
 *   E1  FULL-LINE COMMENT (`^\s*#`). Inherited verbatim from the file-scoped
 *       scan this generalises, whose own comment states the reason: a file
 *       refusing a construct has to name it. Full-line only — a trailing
 *       comment on a code line is not exempt, because the code half still runs.
 *
 *   E2  A VARIABLE IS ONLY READ THROUGH A SIGIL, AND A GUARDED READ IS THE FIX.
 *       `EPOCHSECONDS` as a bare word is not a read at all — `unset EPOCHSECONDS`
 *       is a no-op on 3.2, and so is naming it in a string. Only `$EPOCHSECONDS`
 *       or `${EPOCHSECONDS...}` reads it, and only an UNGUARDED read is fatal
 *       under `set -u`. `${EPOCHSECONDS:-}` is not a mention being tolerated: it
 *       is the repair, and the shared lock is written that way on purpose.
 *
 *   E3  A BUILTIN OR RESERVED WORD ONLY EXECUTES IN COMMAND POSITION.
 *       `enable -n mapfile readarray` does not invoke `mapfile`; it removes it,
 *       which is what a simulated-3.2 harness does and the opposite of a use.
 *       A token inside a quoted argument — a test-case label, a message — does
 *       not invoke anything either. Neither is preceded by a command separator.
 *
 * Each of the three is a property of the shell, not a concession, and each is
 * pinned in both directions in `--self-test` below.
 *
 * ## Known limit, stated rather than discovered later
 *
 * A construct assembled at runtime is not in command position anywhere the
 * scanner can see it: `eval "mapfile -t x < f"` and `bash -c 'mapfile ...'` both
 * pass. That is a real hole and it is deliberate — closing it needs a shell
 * parser, and widening E3 instead would re-red the tree on the very files that
 * hunt these tokens.
 *
 * ⚠️ Upstream can say the hole is "precisely what the retained SIMULATED runs
 * cover" — it keeps two of them. THIS repository has none, so here the hole is
 * simply UNCOVERED, and that is a smaller claim than upstream's identical-
 * looking sentence. Said plainly rather than inherited: after this gate lands,
 * an `eval "mapfile -t x < f"` in this tree is refused by nothing. Closing it
 * is a separate card, not a line to loosen here.
 *
 * ## The 4.0 operator set, and what is deliberately NOT in the table
 *
 * A denylist's absences read as approvals, so the absences are written down
 * here rather than left to be re-derived one card at a time. After the sweep,
 * every OPERATOR bash 4.0 added has a row: `|&`, `&>>`, `;&`, `;;&`,
 * `${x^^}`/`${x,,}`, and the `{x..y..incr}` brace increment. Out, with reasons:
 *
 *   `**` (globstar). Not a construct on its own — `**` without `shopt -s
 *   globstar` is two ordinary globs and legal on 3.2, so what is refusable is
 *   the option, and the `shopt-4` row already refuses it. A literal `**` token
 *   would also fire on arithmetic exponentiation and on every doubled asterisk
 *   in a `find` argument.
 *
 *   New FLAGS on builtins already refused whole (`mapfile -d`, `readarray -C`).
 *   A `builtin` row refuses its builtin at every flag, so these need no row.
 *
 *   Variables added after 4.0 — `BASH_XTRACEFD` (4.1), `BASH_ARGV0` (5.0),
 *   `SRANDOM` (5.1), `PROMPT_DIRTRIM`. Outside the 4.0 line this sweep drew.
 *   They are named here so the next reader inherits the list instead of
 *   rediscovering it, which is the cost this section exists to stop paying.
 *
 * One entry has LEFT this list, and the departure is recorded because a list of
 * absences that quietly shrinks is as misleading as one that never existed.
 * `test -v` / `[ -v ]` was written here as an open hole — the `-v` unary is one
 * construct with THREE spellings and the `has-v` row saw only `[[` — and it is
 * now closed: that row covers all three. The false-positive judgement the
 * closure needed is written at the row itself rather than here, because that is
 * where a future reader tempted to loosen the pattern will be standing.
 *
 * ## The drift gate over this port
 *
 * This file IS registered in `scripts/upstream-port-pin.json`, so
 * `check-upstream-port-parity` reverses the divergences declared on its entry
 * and compares the reconstruction's bytes against the pinned upstream digest.
 * That ledger is how this repository stops a ported copy drifting into a
 * confident-but-stale report — `scripts/pm/check-half-states.mjs` reached a
 * 4,637-line diff from upstream while reporting greenly. The argument applies
 * to this file with force: its whole subject is that "an absence from a
 * denylist reads as an approval", and upstream actively sweeps the table.
 *
 * ⚠️ So these bytes are PINNED, and this prose pays that cost too. An edit
 * anywhere inside a declared region — this paragraph included — has to move
 * that divergence's `ported` side in the SAME change, or the gate reds with
 * `expected its ported text exactly once, found 0`. That is the intended
 * failure direction: loud, and naming the divergence it could not reverse.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not write a revision into this prose. A port's ref lives on that port's
 * entry in the ledger, beside the digest it was taken with, where `--resync`
 * keeps it correct. This section has gone stale THREE times for want of that
 * rule: objectui#7749 moved a then-ledger-wide ref out from under the sentence
 * describing it, objectui#8288 deleted the field that sentence named, and
 * objectui#8694 registered this file while the section went on arguing it was
 * unregistered. Each time the prose stayed confident and wrong — which is this
 * file's own subject, aimed at itself.
 *
 * ## Population
 *
 * Tracked files under `POPULATION_ROOTS` that are shell: a `.sh` name, or a
 * `sh`/`bash`/`dash`/`ksh`/`zsh` shebang whatever the name.
 *
 * ⚠️ The shebang half's STATUS DIFFERS from upstream's, and inheriting
 * upstream's sentence would have been the false half of this port. Upstream
 * measures 2 shebang-only scripts (`.githooks/pre-commit`, `.githooks/pre-push`)
 * and calls the half load-bearing. Measured HERE on `origin/main` `28cfff4`:
 * every one of the 12 shell files in this population carries a `.sh` name, so
 * the shebang census is **0** and the half catches nothing TODAY. It is kept
 * because it is the half that would catch the first extension-less script
 * someone adds — and because dropping it would make a future re-sync with
 * upstream a semantic merge rather than a textual one. Its mechanism is
 * therefore pinned where it can actually be exercised: the end-to-end fixture
 * in `--self-test` plants a shebang-only script under a walked root and
 * requires the census to see it. ⛔ The real-tree leg must NOT assert
 * `byShebang > 0` here; upstream's does, and it would be red on day one.
 *
 * Deliberately OUT: `package.json` script bodies and heredocs inside `.mjs`.
 * Both really can carry shell, and both are excluded for the same reason — the
 * scanner would have to decide which spans of a non-shell file are shell before
 * it could judge a line, and a wrong answer there is a finding fabricated out
 * of JavaScript. The population is files whose WHOLE content is shell, which is
 * decidable from the name and the first line and from nothing else.
 *
 * Discovery reads the git index, so an ignored or generated file is never
 * scanned and a newly tracked script is scanned the moment it is staged.
 * An empty population is a REFUSAL, not a quiet pass (#4690).

 *     said so it is not mistaken for a live local mechanism — but the shape is

 * ⚠️ `since` is DOCUMENTATION, not a predicate. Nothing here branches on it:

 * whether a construct arrived in 4.0 or 5.0. It is carried because a failure
 * message that says "bash 4.2" tells the reader why their green local run
 * proves nothing, and a bare "not portable" does not. The tier-1 six carry the
 * versions this repo already recorded beside its own repairs; the rest carry

 * that wrote this file (the GNU documentation hosts are egress-blocked there) —
 * so what IS verified, on every run of `--self-test`, is the property that
 * actually decides findings: that each `pattern` matches a real, parseable
 * instance of the construct it claims to describe, and matches nothing in the
 * exempt forms beside it.
 *
 * The four rows added by the 4.0 operator sweep (`pipe-both`,
 * `case-fallthrough-next`, `brace-increment`, `bashpid`) are the exception:
 * their versions were read off the bash NEWS text itself, which was reachable
 * from the seat that added them. `|&` is "a synonym for `2>&1 |`", `;&` and
 * `;;&` are the two new case terminators, and `$BASHPID` is "a new variable" —
 * all four entries under bash 4.0.
 *
 * `has-v` is the second exception, and the only row whose version has been read
 * from a primary source in BOTH of bash's own release documents. It is recorded
 * at length because the row was challenged and the challenge was refused on
 * measurement, which is the expensive half to re-derive. #12760 reported the
 * `-v` unary as bash 4.1 and proposed correcting this row's `4.2` down. In the
 * bash maintainer's NEWS the line
 *
 *     f.  test/[/[[ have a new -v variable unary operator, which returns
 *         success if `variable' has been set.
 *
 * occurs exactly ONCE in the whole file, under "the new features added to
 * bash-4.2 since the release of bash-4.1"; CHANGES carries the same line under
 * `bash-4.2-alpha`. The 4.1 reading is the one that section header invites — it
 * names two versions and the second is the wrong one to take. `4.2` stands. The
 * later entries corroborate it rather than competing with it: 4.3 "The
 * test/[/[[ `-v variable' binary operator now understands array" references,
 * and 5.1 "`test -v N' can now test whether or not positional parameter N is
 * set." Both extend an operator that already exists.
 *
 * `kind` selects the exemption rule, and is the whole of E2/E3:
 *
 *   `builtin`   only executes in command position (E3)
 *   `variable`  only read through a sigil, and a guarded read is correct (E2)
 *   `syntax`    an operator or expansion — position-independent, flagged

  // denylist-absence shape again, one level down, INSIDE a row that already
  // existed and therefore read as covered.
  //
  // Widening it is NOT the mechanical edit the four 4.0 operator rows were,
  // because `[ -v` is also the opening of an ordinary bracket EXPRESSION:
  // `tr -d '[ -v]'` is the character range space-to-v, and a `sed` class or a
  // `case` glob carries the same shape legitimately. A wrong widening reddens
  // the tree on CORRECT 3.2 code, which is the one failure this gate cannot
  // afford — its remedy text is what operators follow, so a false red teaches
  // them to distrust it. Three discriminators, each pinned in both directions
  // in `--self-test`, and each load-bearing on a line the other two miss:
  //
  //   1. COMMAND POSITION — `kind: 'builtin'`, so CMD_POS applies. `test` and
  //      `[` are builtins and `[[` is a reserved word, so all three take effect
  //      only where a command can start. This is E3 unchanged, and it is shell
  //      semantics rather than a heuristic: `[[` outside command position is
  //      not the operator at all. A bracket expression is an ARGUMENT — in
  //      `tr -d '[ -v]'` the `[` sits after a quote, which is no separator.
  //      (`coproc` is the precedent for a reserved word carried as `builtin`.)
  //   2. `-v` IS A WHOLE WORD — `[ \t]+` on BOTH sides. A range closes its class
  //      immediately after the `v`, so it never reaches an operand. This is the
  //      one that carries a `case` glob at the start of a line, where
  //      discriminator 1 matches and cannot help.
  //   3. AN OPERAND FOLLOWS. The unary takes a variable name, an array
  //      reference (4.3), a positional parameter (5.1) or an expansion — never
  //      a `]`. This is the one that carries `[ -v ]`, which is not the unary
  //      at all but a 3.2-LEGAL one-argument `test` asking whether the string
  //      `-v` is non-empty.
  //
  // The two failure DIRECTIONS differ across the spellings, the way the
  // `&>>`/`|&` pair does, and the message now says so. Measured on bash 5.2.21
  // with `-Z` standing in for `-v`, since an unrecognised unary takes the same
  // path today that `-v` takes on 3.2 — a proxy, stated as one:
  //
  //   `[[ -Z name ]]`  `bash -n` FAILS: "conditional binary operator expected",
  //                    "syntax error near `name'". A parse error, so not one
  //                    line of the script runs.
  //   `[ -Z name ]`    both PARSE; at run time "unary operator expected" goes
  //   `test -Z name`   to stderr, the test is FALSE, and the run CONTINUES.
  //
  // So the row that matched only `[[` carried the QUIET description — which
  // belonged to the two spellings it could not see, and not to the one it could.
  //
  // The attributions above are MEASURED rather than asserted. Each
  // discriminator was removed on disk in turn and `--self-test` read back:
  //
  //   drop 1 and 3, keep the word boundary   4 legs red — `run_test -v`, the
  //                                          quoted mention, `[ -v ]`
  //   drop all three                         7 legs red — adding the `tr`,
  //                                          `sed` and `case`-glob lines
  //   narrow back to `[[` alone              10 legs red — including both new
  //                                          coverage-floor entries
  //
  // So `tr -d '[ -v]'` is carried TWICE over — the quote and the closing `]`
  // each suffice alone — while the `case` glob rests on the word boundary alone
  // and `[ -v ]` on the operand rule alone. No control below is decoration, and
  // no discriminator above is redundant.
