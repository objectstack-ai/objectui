/**
 * RecordPreviewCard — a compact card for any `(objectName, recordId)` pair
 * (objectui#12029, the A2 child of objectui#2763).
 *
 * Polymorphic references are everywhere in the console — an approval request's
 * target, an audit row, an activity entry, a comment — and until now nothing
 * rendered one as a RECORD: the Approvals Inbox shows the target as a bare
 * title. This card resolves the target object's definition and draws the
 * record the way the record page's own header draws it.
 *
 * ## Module-internal on purpose
 *
 * Nothing re-exports this file from the package entry and it registers no
 * component type. Registering it as a type page metadata can reference is the
 * job of the first card that consumes it (objectui#2763's B1), which also owns
 * any spec type that registration might need.
 *
 * ## No rule of its own: it composes the record page's rules
 *
 * - **Title** — `getRecordDisplayName` from `@object-ui/core`, the one ADR-0079
 *   ladder (`nameField`, then its deprecated alias, then `titleFormat`, then
 *   type-aware derivation, then `Record #<id>`). The record page's H1 and
 *   breadcrumb read the same function.
 * - **Key fields** — `deriveHighlightFields(def, detectStatusField(def))` from
 *   `@object-ui/plugin-detail`, the exact call the synthesized record page uses
 *   for its highlights strip (`buildDefaultHighlights`): the object's declared
 *   `highlightFields` (ADR-0085) first, else the same heuristic.
 * - **Field values** — `HeaderHighlight`, the strip the record page draws those
 *   fields with, so a value reads here exactly as it reads on the record page.
 * - **Field-level security** — the served row passes through
 *   `withoutDeniedFields` before the title and the fields read it, as every
 *   surface that builds a display value from a whole row does (objectui#10594),
 *   and the `$expand` list is gated the way the record page gates its own
 *   (objectui#7230).
 *
 * The strip runs inside its own read-only `InlineEditProvider`. Without it a
 * card mounted on a record page would join THAT page's edit session: the
 * host's draft would be laid over this record's values, and an editable chip
 * would write into the host record's draft.
 *
 * ## The four states, and what the card may say about each
 *
 * - `absent` — the pair addresses nothing (no object name or no record id).
 *   Nothing is read; the card renders the shared empty-value placeholder.
 * - `loading` — the definition or the record read has not answered yet.
 * - `readable` — the record read returned the record.
 * - `unreadable` — every other answer: the object's definition is unavailable,
 *   there is no data source, the by-id read resolved with no record, or it was
 *   rejected (refused or failed). ONE rendering for all of them, and it says
 *   nothing about why — the Approvals Inbox's rule (objectui#5211,
 *   objectui#8631, objectui#11878; see `recordReadability.ts` and
 *   `unresolvableRecordReference.ts` in `apps/console`). The platform answers a
 *   by-id read of a record outside the viewer's row set with the same 404 it
 *   gives a deleted one, on purpose, so a card that told "deleted" apart from
 *   "not visible" would be an existence oracle. That is also why `absent` is
 *   about the REFERENCE and never about the record: the card cannot learn from
 *   its own read that a record is gone. A deletion the platform asserts (an
 *   approval's `record_deleted`) is the caller's to render, not this card's.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * - The definition comes from `useMetadataItem('object', name)`: a cache hit
 *   when the console already holds that object, otherwise one by-name read that
 *   `MetadataProvider` de-duplicates in flight and caches, so N cards for one
 *   object share a single definition read.
 * - The record is one `findOne` per card, the request shape the record page
 *   sends: no params, or `$expand` naming only the reference fields the card
 *   shows. The ObjectStack adapter shares concurrent identical reads
 *   (objectui#11699), but N cards for N different ids are N reads — a list that
 *   renders many cards should weigh that before it does.
 * - The card re-reads in place when the record is invalidated on the data bus
 *   (`useDataInvalidation`), keeping what it shows until the answer lands.
