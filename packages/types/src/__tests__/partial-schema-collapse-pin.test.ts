/**
 * `PartialSchema<T>` declares ONE property for every instantiation — pinned, not
 * repaired (objectui#6397).
 *
 * ## What this file asserts, and why it is a PIN rather than a fix
 *
 * `packages/types/src/index.ts` exports:
 *
 *   export type PartialSchema<T extends BaseSchema> = {
 *     type: T['type'];
 *   } & Partial<Omit<T, 'type'>>;
 *
 * Its doc comment promises "all properties optional except the type". It does
 * not deliver that. Every instantiation declares exactly ONE property — `type`
 * — and carries a live `[key: string]: any`, so it accepts anything. Measured
 * through the checker against the emitted `index.d.ts`, the same instrument
 * that produced objectui#6269's 61 -> 0 reading:
 *
 *   PartialSchema<ObjectGridSchema>  -> 1 declared property: type   (source: 61)
 *   PartialSchema<ObjectFormSchema>  -> 1 declared property: type   (source: 67)
 *   PartialSchema<ObjectViewSchema>  -> 1 declared property: type   (source: 42)
 *   PartialSchema<ButtonSchema>      -> 1 declared property: type   (source: 27)
 *
 * ## The mechanism — objectui#6151 / #6269, third position
 *
 * `Omit<T, K>` is `Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, K>>`, and `keyof T` on a type
 * carrying a string index signature is `string | number` — the literal member
 * names are ABSORBED. Every `T extends BaseSchema` inherits `BaseSchema`'s
 * `[key: string]: any` (objectui#5155), so `Partial<Omit<T, 'type'>>` rebuilds a
 * type holding the index signature and none of the named members. The explicit
 * `{ type: T['type'] }` half of the intersection is the only reason the count is
 * 1 and not 0.
 *
 * objectui#6151 fixed this collapse in a HERITAGE clause and #6269 fixed it in
 * PROPERTY position. Neither of their guards can see this one: #6151's walks the
 * `LayoutSchema` union, #6269's reads `ObjectViewSchema`'s two slot properties,
 * and this is a GENERIC MAPPED-TYPE ALIAS with no union membership and no
 * declaring property. Hence a third pin.
 *
 * ## Why a pin and not a repair
 *
 * ⛔ Do not "fix" the declaration here, and do not tag it `@deprecated`. Triage
 * ruled (objectui#6397, 2026-08-25 re-judgement):
 *
 *   - Retiring the alias is a REMOVAL OF A PUBLISHED EXPORT of
 *     `@object-ui/types` — a breaking removal of published capability, which
 *     sits on the human floor. Not a dev's call, and not this file's business.
 *   - Repairing it in place was read as not available: `T` is generic, so there
 *     is no literal key list to `Pick` (the escape #6269 used for its two
 *     concrete schemas), and the triage held that every generic re-spelling —
 *     `{ [K in keyof T as K extends 'type' ? never : K]?: T[K] }` included —
 *     collapses for the same `keyof T` reason.
 *     ⚠️ That last reading is FALSE. A
 *     key-remapping mapped type iterates the named members and the index
 *     signature separately, so it keeps the named members; `OmitDeclared` in
 *     `../form.ts` is that spelling, and objectui#9256's E3 slice repaired two
 *     published faces with it (pinned in
 *     `content-channel-e3-residual-9256.test.ts`). `PartialSchema`'s own
 *     docblock in `../index.ts` records why the alias is still left as
 *     written; this file's assertions are about the alias as written and do
 *     not move.
 *   - Once objectui#5155 removes the root index signature, the alias starts
 *     working AS WRITTEN with no edit at all, and the removal question
 *     dissolves.
 *
 * So the one state that must not survive is "declared, published, collapsed,
 * and UNPINNED" — a published type that promises
 * `{ type } & everything-else-optional` and delivers `{ type } & any`, ready for
 * the next consumer to adopt as protection it does not provide. This file is
 * what removes the "unpinned".
 *
 * ## 🗑️ Removal condition — the objectui#5155 sequencing note
 *
 * ⭐ THIS FILE IS EXPECTED TO GO RED WHEN objectui#5155 LANDS. That is the
 * point, not a regression. When a #5155 phase drops `[key: string]: any` from
 * `BaseSchema`, `keyof T` becomes the literal member union again, `Omit` stops
 * absorbing names, and `PartialSchema<ObjectGridSchema>` jumps from 1 declared
 * property to 61. Section 3's tripwire (`BaseSchema` still declares a string
 * index) is the flag that says which side of that transition you are on.
 *
 * The correct response to that red is NOT to loosen these assertions. It is to
 * delete this file and, if `PartialSchema` is still unconsumed at that point,
 * file a fresh enforce-or-remove card for the maintainer — removal of a
 * published export stays on the human floor either way.
 *
 * ## Why it emits its own declarations instead of reading `dist/`
 *
 * This repo's per-PR `test` job runs `pnpm test` with NO build ahead of it
 * (turbo's `test` task only `dependsOn: ["^build"]` — the DEPENDENCY closure,
 * never the package's own build), and `packages/types` has no workspace
 * dependencies, so nothing builds it. A guard reading `dist/index.d.ts` would be
 * absent-or-stale on a cold CI cache — vacuous exactly where it is needed. So
 * this file runs the package's OWN tsconfig through the compiler API and
 * measures the emitted declaration: the artifact a consumer resolves, derived
 * deterministically and with no dependence on CI job ordering. Same reasoning as
 * `stack-schema-emitted-members.test.ts`, `object-view-slot-key-lists.test.ts`
 * and `package-exports-manifest.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Census (objectui#6397, re-run on this branch)
 *
 * `PartialSchema` has ZERO in-repo instantiations. A grep across `packages/`,
 * `apps/`, `examples/`, `content/`, `docs/` and `scripts/` (excluding
 * `node_modules` and `dist`) finds exactly ONE occurrence of the identifier: the
 * declaration itself at `packages/types/src/index.ts`. There is no call site to
 * pin against, so the four types measured below are chosen deliberately — they
 * are the four the card itself measured, they are real published schemas from
 * four different modules of this package (`objectql`, `objectql`, `objectql`,
 * `base`-derived form/action families), and they are exactly the population an
 * "editor partial schema" alias would be pointed at. The synthetic type appears
 * only in section 1, where it is the CONTROL, never the subject.
