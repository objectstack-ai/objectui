/**
 * `object-form.fields` — the MEMBER shape this renderer reads (objectui#8071,
 * criterion from objectui#8068).
 *
 * The registration declares `{ name: 'fields', type: 'array' }` with no `of`
 * and no description, and the spec's `object-form.fields` row is
 * `z.array(z.unknown())` carrying the prose "Limit/order the fields shown". So
 * NOTHING on either declared side says what a member is: every coarse member
 * kind parses, and the read site is the whole member contract. That is exactly
 * the population objectui#8068 refuses to leave unwatched, and this file is
 * this key's answer.
 *
 * WHAT THE RENDERER READS, measured at `ObjectForm.tsx`'s `SimpleObjectForm`
 * (the `const fieldsToShow = schema.fields || Object.keys(objectSchema.fields)`
 * loop) and at `flatFields.ts`'s `buildFlatFields`, which the drawer and modal
 * presentations share:
 *
 *     a member is a BARE FIELD NAME, looked up in the object schema.
 *
 * The pin is that sentence made falsifiable, plus the ONE distinction that
 * makes this key worth a pin of its own rather than a note: `object-form` has a
 * SECOND authoring surface spelled `fields` — `sections[].fields` — and the two
 * do NOT share a member vocabulary. A section field may be the spec's
 * `FormFieldSchema` object, whose identity key is `field` (see
 * `sectionFields.ts`, and `sectionFields.spec-parity.test.ts` for its key set).
 * That same object as a member of the TOP-LEVEL `fields` resolves to no name
 * and is dropped from render — no throw, no empty-state.
 *
 * Until objectui#8738 route 1 that drop was also SILENT — no console warning
 * either. The maintainer ruling at issuecomment-5603577602 required a named
 * `console.warn` naming the skipped key and the vocabulary difference (same
 * voice/dedupe discipline as `sectionFields.ts`'s `warnOnMixedVocabulary`,
 * see `warnUnresolvedTopLevelField`). Row 4 below now pins that the warning
 * fires; the block after row 6 pins both its legs (fires for an unresolvable
 * member, does not fire for a legal one) with entries distinct from row 4's,
 * since the warning's dedupe Set is module-scoped for the whole file run.
 *

 * ⛔ NOT a restatement of the declaration: the declaration says `array` and
 * stops. Every row below is a render whose outcome would change if the read
 * site changed — the ablation objectui#8071 ran on this file removed the
 * `typeof fieldName === 'string'` name resolution and reddened rows 1, 3 and 5.
 *
 * The `{ name }` spelling in row 5 is recorded as the renderer's tolerance, not
 * as a second contract (AGENTS.md #0.1): it is what `buildFlatFields` documents
 * ("field names or objects carrying one") and what the loop's
 * `(fieldName as any).name` fallback does. Pinned so that a future edit removing
 * it is a decision rather than an accident, and so the contrast with the
 * REJECTED `{ field }` spelling above it cannot quietly invert.
