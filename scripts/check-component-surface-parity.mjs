 * component-surface-parity -- where the FOUR declared surfaces of one
 * registered component type disagree.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-component-surface-parity.mjs   (also `pnpm check:component-surface-parity`)
 *       node scripts/check-component-surface-parity.mjs --list      (every judged type, one line each)
 *       node scripts/check-component-surface-parity.mjs --type TYPE (one type, all four surfaces)
 *
 * Exit: 0 -- ALWAYS, disagreements included. See "REPORT-ONLY" below.
 *       1 -- only when the instrument could not read its own inputs
 *            ({@link ExtractionError}), which is never a pass.
 *
 * ## The authority order, which is a ruling and not this script's opinion
 *
 * objectui#4631, director seat batch #112 item 2, 2026-09-10. Quoted rather
 * than paraphrased because the ordering IS the specification:
 *
 *   spec 的 `ComponentPropsMap`(有声明时)> 渲染器实际读的键(实现)
 *   > TS 接口与注册表 `inputs`(实现的说明书,跟随)
 *
 *   门:`check:component-surface-parity`——TS 接口键集 = spec 键集 ∪ 渲染器读键集;
 *   `inputs` ⊆ 该集合;`defaultProps` 中作为设计器种子而非默认值的行须登记理由。
 *   report-only 起步,零分歧后翻阻断。
 *
 * So the rule this file mechanises, in one line: the TS interface key set is
 * the union of the spec key set and the renderer-read key set, `inputs` is a
 * subset of that union, and a `defaultProps` row that is a DESIGNER SEED rather
 * than a default claim has to say so out loud.
 *
 * ## REPORT-ONLY, and why that is the ruling rather than timidity
 *
 * The ruling's own sequencing is 「report-only 起步,零分歧后翻阻断」 -- start
 * report-only, flip to blocking once the census reads zero. This script
 * therefore exits 0 with findings, and the flip is a separate card measured
 * against the census in the pull request that landed this file. ⛔ Do not
 * change the exit discipline here to "fix" a red pipeline; there is no pipeline
 * wired to it yet, deliberately.
 *
 * ⛔ Repairing a disagreement this script finds is ALSO not this file's job and
 * was out of scope when it was built. The same ruling carries an ordering note
 * (objectui#4631, 2026-09-10T11:0xZ) that governs every repair: 先判协议对不对
 * -- decide whether the PROTOCOL is right first, and where it is not, the spec
 * card goes first. A repair chosen here would be choosing an arm of that
 * ordering by mechanism instead of by ruling.
 *
 * ## The failure mode being measured
 *
 * An author following any ONE of the four surfaces can still render blank, with
 * no error anywhere. `tooltip` was the specimen: `TooltipSchema` declared
 * `children` REQUIRED and the renderer read `schema.trigger`, so the published
 * TypeScript type -- the thing an editor completes from and an AI authoring
 * tool retrieves -- taught a key nothing reads. It type-checked. It rendered
 * nothing. No red tile, no warning, no gate.
 *
 * ## What this gate is NOT, so it is not mistaken for its neighbours
 *
 * `apps/console/src/__tests__/registry-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts` reconciles
 * registry `inputs` against the spec's `ComponentPropsMap` -- two of these four
 * surfaces -- from the LIVE registry, by importing the real registration graph.
 * It owns that pair, in both directions, with its own exemption discipline, and
 * this script neither repeats nor contradicts it:
 *
 *   - that test judges `inputs` vs SPEC. This one judges `inputs` vs the UNION
 *     (spec ∪ renderer reads), which is the ruling's accept set and is strictly
 *     wider -- so a key this script passes may still be judged there, and the
 *     test stays the authority on the spec-only direction.
 *   - that test cannot see the two surfaces this one exists for: the TS
 *     interface in `packages/types`, and what the renderer actually READS. A
 *     live registry holds neither.
 *   - it reads a RUNTIME registry, this one reads SOURCE. A lazily registered
 *     block is a stub at runtime; in source its `register()` call is right
 *     there. The two populations therefore differ on purpose.
 *
 * `scripts/check-handler-key-read-sites.mjs` is the same read-site question
 * narrowed to `on*` handler keys and judged against the ZOD arms; it BLOCKS.
 * This script deliberately reuses that gate's extraction primitives (see the
 * import block) rather than growing a fourth copy of "which files ship" and
 * "which registrations exist" -- but it judges every key, not the handler ones,
 * and against the TS interface rather than the zod mirror.
 *
 * `scripts/check-designer-field-key-parity.mjs` is field-definition parity on
 * the metadata designer's write path. Unrelated population, unrelated oracle.
 *
 * ## The four surfaces, and where each is read FROM
 *
 *   1. SPEC      `ComponentPropsMap[fullType]` from the installed
 *                `@objectstack/spec/ui`, read through a dynamic `import()` for
 *                the same provenance reason its sibling states: a
 *                CJS-resolving gate cannot be proven by identity to be reading
 *                the build the app bundles against. An entry that is
 *                `z.never()` DECLARES the type with an empty key set (that is
 *                what `user:profile` means) -- it is not a missing entry.
 *   2. READS     every `schema.<key>` / `<props>.<key>` property access, every
 *                `schema['<key>']` element access and every destructured
 *                binding of `schema`, reachable from the registered component
 *                -- through same-file declarations, one-level aliases, the HOC
 *                spelling, static relative imports inside the package, and the
 *                `<Child schema={…}>` chain. Plus the FRAMEWORK reads, derived
 *                below.
 *   3. INTERFACE the `XSchema` named by the registered component's `schema`
 *                parameter, resolved in `packages/types/src`, unioned along
 *                `extends` / `&` within that package and stopping at
 *                {@link BASE_INTERFACE}.
 *   4. INPUTS    the `inputs: [{ name }]` array of the `register()` meta, plus
 *                its `defaultProps` object, read off the call site.
 *
 * ## The FRAMEWORK read set is DERIVED, never listed
 *
 * `className`, `visible`, `dataSource`, `testId` and their neighbours are read
 * off EVERY schema by the render loop, not by the block's own renderer. Listing
 * them here would be a second copy of a set that moves -- AGENTS.md #9 exactly.
 * They are read out of {@link FRAMEWORK_READ_SOURCE}: its `schema.<key>` /
 * `evaluatedSchema.<key>` accesses, and the binding names of every object
 * destructure of those two. A run whose framework set comes back EMPTY is an
 * {@link ExtractionError}, because an empty one turns every `className` in the
 * tree into a finding -- confidently red over a broken instrument, which is the
 * same defect as a confident green.
 *
 * ## `defaultProps`: one face or two, which is the question the card asked
 *
 * A `defaultProps` row sitting beside a renderer fallback for the same key is a
 * COMPARABLE PAIR. Where the two literals differ the two faces disagree -- but
 * not every disagreement is a defect, and that is the distinction the ruling
 * asked for: `defaultProps` is a designer SEED as much as a default claim. A
 * seed of `''` for a markdown body is useless; a seed is what makes a
 * freshly-dropped component look like something. So a row whose divergence is
 * deliberate must carry a REGISTERED REASON in {@link DESIGNER_SEED_ROWS} --
 * and a registered row whose pair no longer diverges is reported as STALE, so
 * the ledger cannot rot into a permanent allowlist.
 *
 * ## Limits, stated rather than discovered later
 *
 *   - ⛔ DYNAMICALLY TYPED REGISTRATIONS ARE OUTSIDE THE CENSUS, and this is the
 *     largest exclusion in it. A factory that calls
 *     `ComponentRegistry.register(tag, …)` inside a loop registers one component
 *     type per iteration and this reader can name NONE of them -- the key exists
 *     only at run time. The families behind those call sites (`ui:HTML-TAG` from
 *     the html-element and semantic factories, `field:*` from the field-widget
 *     map) are not in the judged count and produce no finding. They are reported
 *     as the `dynamicRegistrations` coverage bucket, with every call site printed
 *     -- because a later card reading "zero" over a population that never
 *     contained them would be reading nothing at all. ⛔ Enumerating the loops by
 *     guessing is worse than naming the exclusion: a half-enumerated family is a
 *     census nobody can reconstruct. objectui#4631 review, F1.
 *   - ⛔ THE SPEC ARM CAN BE INERT, and the run says so when it is. Only a type
 *     with BOTH a `ComponentPropsMap` entry and a resolvable interface can
 *     produce a spec-caused `interface-missing-key`; the counters print that
 *     INTERSECTION beside its two halves, and shout when it is zero. Where it is
 *     zero the spec half only ever widens the accept set -- it suppresses, never
 *     raises. objectui#4631 review, F2.
 *   - `register()` splices `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT` into `inputs` at RUNTIME
 *     for a block wrapping `ElementDataSourceGate`
 *     (`withElementDataSourceInput`). A source read cannot see it. The key it
 *     splices is `dataSource`, which the framework set already carries, so the
 *     effect is bounded -- but an `inputs` census taken here is the SOURCE one.
 *   - a registration whose component this walk cannot resolve to a body, and an
 *     interface it cannot name or find, are reported as COVERAGE GAPS in their
 *     own buckets and are never silently counted as "no reads" / "no keys". A
 *     zero read set read as truth would report every declared key as extra.
 *   - `schema: any` is not an interface. It is counted as unresolved. Nor is
 *     `schema: BaseSchema`: it resolves, but to an interface with no OWN
 *     members, so such a block can never produce `interface-extra-key`. The
 *     counters name that subset inside the "with a TS interface" number rather
 *     than letting it read as full coverage. objectui#4631 review, F5.
 *   - a rule is only as good as its own coverage gap is guarded. Both interface
 *     rules skip a type whose interface did not resolve, and the `inputs` rule
 *     skips a type whose RENDERER did not resolve, for the identical reason: an
 *     empty read set read as truth reports every declared key as outside the key
 *     set. Those rows stay in the `rendererUnresolved` bucket. objectui#4631
 *     review, F3.
 *   - value TYPES are out of reach here, as they are for every key-name parity
 *     check in this tree: a key in perfect name parity whose declared type is
 *     narrower than the contract passes.
