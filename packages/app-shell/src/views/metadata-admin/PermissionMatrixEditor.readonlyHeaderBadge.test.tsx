/**
 * The PageShell header badge must report the gate that actually governs the
 * screen — objectui#4036, B-half of the objectstack#5768 split ruling.
 *
 * Measured on a dogfood run: `/studio/com.example.showcase/access` rendered the
 * permission set's title row as
 *
 *   权限集 · showcase_contributor · 安全 · 可写 · 已授权对象 5 · 字段覆盖 3 · 历史
 *                                        ^^^^
 *
 * while all 207 permission checkboxes and 发布 below it were disabled with the
 * read-only-package tooltip. Both renderings answer "can you write this?" and
 * they disagreed, because they read different inputs:
 *
 *   • the CONTROLS read `!!resolved.allowOrgOverride && !readOnly` — the type
 *     registry AND the host package gate;
 *   • the BADGE read `entry.allowOrgOverride` alone. `permission` was then one
 *     of the 15 overlay-allowed types, so that flag was true and the badge said
 *     "writable" no matter which package you were in.
 *
 * This suite pins the display side only. The gating assertions here are
 * CONTROLS: the B-half ruling explicitly keeps Studio's blanket package-level
 * read-only intact ("Studio 维持包级只读") pending the per-type A-half review,
 * so a fix that made anything editable would be the wrong fix even though the
 * badge assertions would still pass.
 *
 * ## Amendment — objectui#4446: the CONTROLS were the outlier, not the badge
 *
 * The paragraph above called the controls' formula "the right answer". That was
 * wrong on the type half, and this suite could not see it: every case here
 * drives the HOST gate (`readOnly` true/absent) with `allowOrgOverride: true`
 * throughout, so it never rendered the one shape where the two disagree.
 *
 * `WritabilityBadge` is read-only exactly when
 * `readOnly || (!allowOrgOverride && !allowRuntimeCreate)`; the controls were
 * read-only when `readOnly || !allowOrgOverride`. The gap is precisely
 * `!allowOrgOverride && allowRuntimeCreate` — which is the stock-boot
 * `permission` shape today (objectstack#6483 set `allowOrgOverride: false` and
 * deliberately kept `allowRuntimeCreate: true`). There the badge said
 * "create-only" over 207 dead checkboxes.
 *
 * So the badge already consulted the full disjunction and the controls did not.
 * Fixing the controls (`allowOrgOverride || allowRuntimeCreate`) makes the two
 * predicates byte-identical rather than merely closer — the convergence is
 * pinned below, across all four states, so neither side can drift again.
 *
 * The host gate is UNTOUCHED and still dominant, so "Studio 维持包级只读" holds
 * exactly as before: a read-only package locks this screen whatever the type
 * permits. What changed is the type half, and only in the direction the server
 * itself already allows (it refuses only when BOTH flags are false).
