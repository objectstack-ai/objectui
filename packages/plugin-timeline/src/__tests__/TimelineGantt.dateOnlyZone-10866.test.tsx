/**
 * objectui#10866, slice 3 — the timeline renderer's gantt variant draws a
 * stored date-only day on that day, in every zone.
 *
 * ── What was measured ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every read on the gantt branch used the engine's own `Date` parse, which
 * reads a date-only `2026-10-05` as UTC midnight:
 *
 *  - the axis headers (`generateTimeScaleHeaders`) walked that instant with
 *    LOCAL setters and printed it with LOCAL getters, so west of UTC a day
 *    axis over October 5th to 7th read Oct 4, Oct 5, Oct 6, and the schema
 *    catalog's `gantt-style-timeline.json` read Dec 2023 over a plan that
 *    starts on January 1st;
 *  - the computed extent (`calculateDateRange`) printed the UTC day of each
 *    end, and the empty plan's axis (`emptyGanttDateRange`) took the UTC day
 *    as "today";
 *  - the bar geometry (`calculateBarDimensions`), the validity gate
 *    (`findUnusableGanttDate`) and the min-over-max guard read the same
 *    UTC midnight.
 *
 * Slice 2 moved the bar TOOLTIP to the shared step, `toDisplayDate`
 * (`@object-ui/core`, the objectui#10183 convention), so west of UTC the
 * tooltip named the stored day under a header that read the day before. Every
 * read above now takes the same step: a date-only value is local midnight of
 * the day it names, and a value with a time part keeps its instant, which the
 * axis places in the viewer's own day. The extent prints the day from local
 * getters, because a local midnight's `toISOString()` names the day before
 * EAST of UTC — so the Shanghai extent row is green on the base and is the
 * half a parse-only repair would break.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ The zone cases run ONLY when driven, in a FORKS child ────────────────
 * `process.env.TZ` written inside a test of the normal run does not move the
 * zone (the root config runs `pool: 'threads'`), so the zone cases are
 * skipped there and `scripts/__tests__/date-only-zone-pins-10183.test.ts`
 * runs them on the forks pool and fails unless every one ran and passed. Each
 * zone opens with a rig case, so a child whose zone did not move reds instead
 * of going quietly green. The suite-zone cases run in the normal run too.
 *
 * `Asia/Shanghai` is the control: east of UTC the UTC-midnight parse already
 * landed on the named day, and an hour-offset "repair" would break it.
