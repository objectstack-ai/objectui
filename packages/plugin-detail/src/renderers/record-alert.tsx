 * `record:alert` — banner-style notice rendered between the page header and
 * the body of a record page. Use to draw the user's attention to a state
 * that needs action (unverified email, expired trial, locked account, …)
 * without forcing them to hunt for the relevant control.
 *
 * Schema
 * ------
 *   {
 *     type: 'record:alert',
 *     properties: {
 *       severity: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'success',  // default 'info'
 *       title?: string,
 *       body?: string,
 *       visible?: string | { dialect, source } | boolean,    // CEL/template predicate
 *       icon?: string,                                       // lucide name
 *       action?: {                                           // optional CTA
 *         actionName: string,                                // resolved from object metadata
 *         label?: string,                                    // overrides action.label
 *       },
 *       dismissible?: boolean,                               // X to dismiss
 *       dismissKey?: string,                                 // localStorage key suffix
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * Visibility model
 * ----------------
 *   `properties.visible` is normalized by `toPredicateInput` and evaluated by
 *   `useCondition` against `usePredicateRecordContext(record)` — the repo's one
 *   row-binding rule (objectui#4075 / #4077), shared with `<ActionButton>` /
 *   `<ActionMenu>` / `<ActionGroup>` / `<ActionIcon>` and app-shell's
 *   `DeclaredActionsBar`, so this banner cannot disagree with the buttons it
 *   pairs with. The row therefore resolves the three ways objectui#5330 ruled
 *   on (maintainer, 2026-08-20): `record.status` — the CANON, what an author
 *   should write — plus the deprecated-but-kept row-action shorthand `status`
 *   and legacy `data.status`.
 *
 *   Merged UNDER the row is whatever the host put in the ambient predicate
 *   scope (`PredicateScopeProvider`; app-shell's `ExpressionProvider` supplies
 *   `current_user` / `user` / `ctx.user` / `os.user` / `data` /
 *   `features`). The row wins, so a host-supplied `record` / `data` cannot
 *   shadow it. `objectName` is NOT in the predicate scope — it is read from
 *   `useRecordContext()` for the metadata lookup and the dismiss key only.
 *
 *   Missing predicate → always visible. A predicate that cannot be evaluated →
 *   also visible: this call site is FAIL-SOFT (it does not pass
 *   `throwOnError`), which is why the unbound spellings above were a
 *   user-visible defect rather than a console line — objectui#4807.
 *   Empty `record` (loading) → hidden (no flash of stale alert), AND the
 *   predicate is not evaluated at all in that frame — a bare/`${…}`
 *   `record.*` reference against an unbound row faults, and evaluating a
 *   verdict this component is about to discard anyway only produced a
 *   permanently misleading `record is not defined` console line on every
 *   load (objectui#5776).
 *
 *   A node-level `visibleWhen` is a SEPARATE gate one tier up, evaluated by
 *   `SchemaRenderer` on its own bindings (notably `data` = the data-source
 *   ADAPTER, not the row). The two compose as AND. Both facts are pinned in
 *   `__tests__/record-alert.visibleWhen.evidence.test.tsx` (group 4) and
 *   `__tests__/record-alert.rowBinding.test.tsx`.
 *
 * CTA wiring
 * ----------
 *   The optional `action.actionName` is resolved from the object's
 *   metadata `actions[]` and executed via the shared `<ActionProvider>`
 *   runner — so confirm dialogs, param dialogs, toast, and reload
 *   handlers all work exactly as they do in `record:quick_actions`.

 * Local (unexported) prop shape for the renderer below.
 *
 * ⚠️ Spelled `RecordAlertRendererProps`, NOT `RecordAlertProps`. At the RESOLVED
 * `@objectstack/spec` pin, `@objectstack/spec/ui` exports `RecordAlertProps` —
 * and a `Record<Block>Props` for every sibling block this directory renders —
 * for the block's AUTHORED properties — the key set nested under
 * `schema.properties` below, and nothing else. What this declaration holds is a
 * different thing one level up: the React props this renderer is called with, a
 * `schema` node plus `className` plus an open tail. Every other renderer beside
 * this one already spells that distinction `…RendererProps`; this file did not,
 * which is why its name was rule 1's last entry in the `check:spec-symbols` DEBT
 * ledger (objectui#7265) while its structurally identical siblings were never
 * in it. Both halves are pinned — that the spec still owns the plain name, and
 * that it does not own this one — in this package's spec-symbol file, together
 * with the sibling convention itself, re-derived from the directory rather than
 * restated here.
 *
 * `title` / `body` accept the inline locale map as well as a plain string
 * (objectui#4970): both are read through `pickLocalized` further down, and the
 * block's published authoring surface declares the two arms
 * (`plugin-detail/src/index.tsx`, `type: ['string', 'object']` since
 * objectui#3832), so while these two said `string` they were narrower than both
 * the renderer and this block's own published surface — the
 * declaration-narrower-than-the-renderer family of objectui#4581.
 *
 * The CTA's `action.label` below is the same slot one level down, widened here
 * (objectui#4998) to match: it is read through the same `pickLocalized` call as
 * `title` / `body` (`const ctaLabel = pickLocalized(props.action?.label, language)`
 * further down), so a declaration of bare `string` was narrower than the
 * renderer's own runtime behaviour, exactly as `title` / `body` were before
 * objectui#4970. This widening is TYPE-only: the block's published surface still
 * declares `action` as a bare `object` with the member shape in prose
 * (`plugin-detail/src/index.tsx`), so there is no manifest arm to align — that
 * half stays parked on the `ComponentInput` member-shape question (PR #3795).
