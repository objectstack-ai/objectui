/**
 * sort-query — lower a block's authored `sort` to the `$orderby` value a
 * `DataSource.find` query carries.
 *
 * ONE authored spelling reaches every object-bound block: the spec's
 * `SortConfig[]` (`[{ field, order }]`). The legacy OData-ish string clause
 * (`"name desc"`) that this function also honoured until objectui#8221 is
 * RETIRED — director ruling, decision batch #77, 2026-09-07 (objectui#8221,
 * maintainer approved), option B: "The platform has one `sort` spelling, the
 * array, everywhere."
 *
 * Why the string had to go rather than be declared alongside the array: every
 * `sort` input in the registry publishes `type: 'array'` alone, so the html
 * tier already answered `type-mismatch` for the string, and
 * `@objectstack/spec` refuses it outright on `element-record-picker`. A
 * spelling that core implements, the docs teach and the validator rejects is
 * three faces disagreeing, and the ruling settled which one wins. Declaring
 * per-block string arms instead (option A) was rejected by name: it would make
 * one key mean different things on different blocks.
 *
 * This is now the ONLY definition in the repo. It was hoisted here because
 * objectstack#7137 added two more read sites (`object-timeline`,
 * `record:line_items`) next to three sibling blocks that each inlined a
 * byte-identical private copy (`ObjectGantt` / `ObjectMap` / `ObjectCalendar`),
 * and a fifth and sixth copy is how the conversions start disagreeing. Those
 * three copies were deliberately left alone by #7137 and collapsed onto this
 * function by objectui#4022; every block now imports it from here.
 *
 * Two deliberate differences from those retired private copies, both of which
 * make this function more faithful to the declared contract rather than adding
 * tolerance — and both are BEHAVIOUR CHANGES the migration delivered, not pure
 * refactor:
 *
 *  - **A missing `order` is READ as ascending rather than dropped.** ⚠️ This
 *    bullet used to say `order` is "optional in `SortConfig`". It is not:
 *    `SortConfig.order` is required on the interface, on its zod mirror, and on
 *    `@objectstack/spec`'s `SortItemSchema`, which refuses an entry without it
 *    (`invalid_value` at `0.order`, measured on `@objectstack/spec@17.4.0`).
 *    Corrected under objectui#8973, which is where objectui#8767's contract
 *    review routed this sentence and its twin in
 *    `@object-ui/types`' `ObjectGridSchema.sort` docblock. The tolerance is
 *    real but it is a RUNTIME one — types are erased, so an entry missing
 *    `order` still arrives and still has to mean something. The private copies
 *    required BOTH keys and silently dropped such an entry, which lost an
 *    authored sort key instead of ordering by it.
 *  - **Nothing usable yields `undefined`, never `{}`.** An empty object is a
 *    truthy value that means "no ordering" only by accident of the adapter's
 *    serializer; `undefined` says it, so the query simply carries no `$orderby`.
 *
 * Not a lenient alias: an unusable input (a number, an object, an array of
 * strings) yields `undefined` rather than a guess. Only the ONE spelling the
 * schema types declare is honoured.
 *
 * ⚠️ A retired string is REFUSED OUT LOUD, not dropped in silence. Types are
 * erased, so the narrowed signature below cannot stop a string: authored JSON,
 * a stored `sys_metadata` row and an `as any` bag all reach this function
 * unparsed. Returning `undefined` and saying nothing would turn every one of
 * those into a row order that quietly stopped applying — the exact failure this
 * repository has measured over and over. See {@link convertSortToQueryParams}.

 * also unconditional, and the opposite of `warnOnUnknownActionKeys`, which only
 * reports keys nothing was ever going to read.
 *
 * ⚠️ This text is read at the moment the author is ALREADY being corrected, so
 * it must not prescribe metadata the spec refuses (objectui#9031). It used to
 * end "`order` is optional and means `'asc'`" — a RUNTIME tolerance stated as
 * an AUTHORING permission. Both halves of that are load-bearing and both have to
 * survive any rewording:
 *
 *  - the tolerance is REAL — a missing `order` is read as ascending here rather
 *    than dropped (see {@link normalizeSortEntries}), because types are erased
 *    and an entry that arrives without it still has to mean something;
 *  - and it is NOT permission — `order` is required on `SortConfig`, on its zod
 *    mirror and on `@objectstack/spec`'s `SortItemSchema`, which refuses an
 *    entry without it.
 *
 * Stating only the first is what made an author who followed this correction
 * verbatim get refused a second time, at publish, by a different door. Deleting
 * the tolerance instead would be the opposite error: it is what this renderer
 * actually does, and a diagnostic that denies it sends the author hunting for a
 * dropped sort key that was never dropped.

 * its array arm interpolated every key unconditionally, so an entry missing
 * `field` or `order` reached the wire as the literal text `undefined`
 * (`$orderby: 'name undefined'`), which the server answers `400 INVALID_QUERY`.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is SHAPE-AGNOSTIC on purpose, and that is what makes it reusable where
 * the map below is not. `object-grid` sends a `"field order"` join string, not
 * this module's `{field: direction}` map; swapping its wire shape is route B on
 * objectui#8767, which the maintainer DECLINED by name (2026-09-10) pending a
 * card that measures the server contract and both readers. Exporting the
 * decision without the map lets that block share the ONE implementation of the
 * rule while keeping the wire shape the declination protects — so "one
 * operation, one implementation" is satisfied for the operation that actually
 * has two copies, rather than being traded away for a shape change nobody
 * ruled on.
 *
 * The two rules, unchanged from the map builder they were lifted out of:
 *
 *  - an entry with no usable `field` is SKIPPED (it names nothing to order by);
 *  - `order` normalizes to `'asc'` unless it is exactly `'desc'`, so a missing
 *    direction means ascending and a garbage one does not reach the wire.
 *
 * @returns The surviving entries in authored order, or `undefined` when nothing
 * orderable was authored — never an empty array, so callers can omit the
 * query key entirely rather than asking for an ordering with no content.
