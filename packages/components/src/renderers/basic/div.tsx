/**
 * The notice, including WHICH AUTHORING SURFACE it is about.
 *
 * Scope is part of the message, not decoration. This type is deprecated on the
 * JSON surface and simultaneously a permanent, first-class tag of the
 * `kind:'html'` tier — an author there writes the plain box tag and our own
 * parser maps it straight through, and no other spelling exists for them to
 * migrate to. A notice that says the type is deprecated FULL STOP is therefore
 * false for one of its two readers, and it was the reader who could do nothing
 * about it who kept receiving it (objectui#4000).
 *
 * ## The guidance was RE-RULED in objectui#6877 — it is no longer #4000's bytes
 *
 * objectui#4000 recorded the migration guidance as "byte-for-byte what it was",
 * and that pin was right for as long as the guidance was merely INCOMPLETE. It
 * became FALSE when the neutral `box` container landed (objectui#3965 /
 * PR #6878). Measured through the real `SchemaRenderer`, on a node carrying an
 * authored `className` and one text child — every replacement the old bullets
 * named changes the rendered result:
 *
 *   card       + `rounded-lg border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm`,
 *              and the children move inside an extra `CardContent` element
 *              (1 element becomes 2)
 *   flex       + `flex flex-row justify-start items-start gap-1.5 sm:gap-2`
 *   container  + `w-full max-w-xl mx-auto p-2 sm:p-3 md:p-4`
 *   stack      + `flex flex-col justify-start items-stretch gap-1.5 sm:gap-2`
 *   grid       + `grid grid-cols-2 gap-4`
 *
 * and four of those five — `flex`, `container`, `stack`, `grid` — read
 * `children` ONLY, so a node that authored `body` loses its content SILENTLY,
 * at an unchanged element count. `box` is the one class-transparent swap, and
 * the old text never named it.
 *
 * That is why this is worth a re-ruling rather than a nice-to-have. Deprecation
 * guidance is followed LITERALLY, by humans and by generating models reading
 * the console alike, so a notice naming only non-drop-in replacements
 * manufactures exactly the conversions objectui#3965 measured and rejected.
 *
 * ⚠️ `box` is not unconditionally drop-in either, and the text below says so
 * instead of selling it as one: it too reads `children` only, so `body` content
 * has to move first. A recommendation that is true WITH a caveat beats a
 * cleaner one that is false — trading one false recommendation for another
 * would be worse than leaving the old text alone.
 *
 * The four surfaces that state this guidance move in ONE stroke: this notice,
 * the declaration below, `content/docs/components/basic/div.mdx`, and the
 * `components-basic-div` catalog category. They are held together by
 * `__tests__/div-guidance-names-box.test.tsx` (objectui#6877) and, for the
 * first two, by `__tests__/deprecation-guidance-agreement.test.tsx`
 * (objectui#6823).
 *
 * ⛔ `span`'s notice is a SEPARATE judgement and is deliberately untouched:
 * `box` is a block-level container, and nothing about the inline replacement
 * story changed. The same pin file asserts that this edit did not sweep it in.
 *
 * ## Quoting convention — load-bearing, not style
 *
 * Inside the bullets, DOUBLE QUOTES mean "component type name" and nothing
 * else; property names take backticks. The objectui#6823 agreement test reads
 * the offered alternatives out of both statements as their double-quoted runs,
 * so a `"body"` written with the wrong quotes would arrive as a component type
 * this notice claims to offer.
