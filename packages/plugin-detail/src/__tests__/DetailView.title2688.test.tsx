/**
 * objectui#2688 — the record surface opened from a gantt row (and any other
 * caller that provides neither `schema.title` nor a resolvable declared name
 * field) floored the header to `Record #<id>` and the meta footer printed the
 * raw `created_by` user id.
 *
 *  - Header: when everything above it misses, a name-ish key sitting right on
 *    the record (e.g. a `name` typed `autonumber`, which the type-aware
 *    derivation deliberately skips) must beat the `Record #<id>` floor.
 *  - Footer: `created_by` / `updated_by` are always user references on
 *    ObjectStack; when the fetched schema omits the audit system fields the
 *    footer must still render them through the REFERENCE RENDERER rather than
 *    degrading to a `text` cell that prints `String(value)`.
 *
 * ## The footer assertions were re-derived at objectui#8695 (PR objectui#9078)
 *
 * They used to read `expect(queryByText(OPAQUE_ID)).toBeNull()` — "the raw id
 * must not appear". ⛔ That was never objectui#2688's ask, and it is now false.
 *
 * objectui#2688's own expected-correct column is `创建人 Dev Admin · 47分钟前`
 * — the RESOLVED NAME — and its card records that the id it complains about
 * DOES exist in `sys_user` with `name = Dev Admin`. In the scenario the card
 * describes, the id disappears because it RESOLVES, not because anything hides
 * it. The located defect the card names is the degradation itself:
 * `objectSchema.fields.created_by` absent ⇒ `type:'text'` ⇒ `String(value)`.
 * So "the id is absent" was only ever a PROXY for "this went through the
 * reference renderer", read off the placeholder that renderer happened to draw
 * when nothing resolved.
 *
 * The proxy was weak even then. Measured on this fixture: the old placeholder
 * was a muted `—`, which is byte-identical to `EmptyValue`'s glyph, and a
 * footer rendered with NO `created_by` at all omits the actor entirely — both
 * satisfy `queryByText(OPAQUE_ID) === null`. The assertion could not tell the
 * reference renderer from a blank cell.
 *
 * objectui#8434 then ruled on that placeholder directly: the affordance for an
 * unresolved reference must be ADDITIVE (a stated marker, not an absence),
 * EPISTEMIC ("this screen did not resolve it", never "not found"), and it must
 * keep the raw value VISIBLE because it "is the only clue for diagnosing
 * existing dirty rows". objectui#8695 carried that ruling to the second
 * renderer with the same defect — the one this footer routes through.
 *
 * ⇒ The assertions below now name what objectui#2688 actually asked for, and
 * name it directly instead of through a placeholder: the footer must render
 * the audit actor through the reference renderer's unresolved affordance, not
 * as a bare text cell. That is STRICTLY STRONGER than the assertion it
 * replaces, which passed for an empty cell too.
