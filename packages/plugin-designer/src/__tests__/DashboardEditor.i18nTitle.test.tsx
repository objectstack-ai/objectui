 * objectui#4163 part 1 — the three `widget.title` reads in `DashboardEditor`,
 * and they are NOT the same kind of read.
 *
 * Two are DISPLAY (the widget card in the list, and the preview pane's tile):
 * a map has to resolve to the locale's string or React renders
 * `[object Object]`.
 *
 * The third is an AUTHORING WRITE — the property panel's single-line title
 * `<input>` — and it is the one where following the `I18nLabel` widening
 * mechanically would destroy data rather than merely look wrong. Resolving a
 * map into the input and writing `e.target.value` back collapses every other
 * locale on the first keystroke.
 *
 * PR #4169 met that by making a map-valued title READ-ONLY, on the premise that
 * "no persisted widget title can be a map" — a premise `@objectstack/spec`
 * 17.0.0 invalidates, so from rc.6 onward the branch denied authors an edit
 * rather than protecting anything reachable (objectui#5428).
 *
 * objectui#5301's maintainer ruling (2026-08-20) supplies the replacement: a
 * save writes back ONLY the active locale's entry and preserves the others,
 * shipped as `@object-ui/i18n`'s `setLocalized`. The pins below are that rule's
 * acceptance test at this surface, and the one that carries the weight is the
 * PRESERVATION pin — "the input is no longer read-only" is equally green
 * against a fix that flattens the map, which is the exact data loss the
 * read-only branch existed to prevent.
 *
 * ⚠️ These pins describe a SINGLE-locale editor: an author reaches only the
 * entry for the locale they are in. Authoring every locale from one panel is a
 * separate open question, deliberately not deferred to a tracker here — the
 * deferral this replaced pointed at #4163, closed as completed 2026-08-15.

 * exactly what happened to the sentence this one replaces (objectui#9513, which
 * found it asserting the answer was "nowhere"). Index arithmetic asks no `lib`
 * question at all, which is why it is kept here rather than modernised.
 *
 * ⚠️ Note which tool decides, because `vitest` never does: esbuild strips types
 * without checking them, so an `.at()` too new for the program's `lib` passes
 * the suite and fails `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`, the half of `type-check`
 * that compiles tests. Left as a named helper so the constraint is stated once
 * instead of re-learned at the next call site.
