/**
 * objectui#3950 — a related list must not offer a sort the platform refuses.
 *
 * A `formula` value is computed on read and no driver materialises a column for
 * it, so a windowed sort — which leaves as a server `$orderby` on the flat field
 * name — has nothing to order by. Silently unordered rows under a `200` before
 * objectstack#6994; `400 INVALID_SORT` after it.
 *
 * The rule is applied at BOTH of this card's sort entry points, because they do
 * not share a derivation: the embedded table's column headers (`table` / `grid`)
 * and the sort-button row that survives for `data-list`. Missing either one
 * leaves the same refused sort reachable through the other control.
 *
 * Client mode is deliberately left alone: the rows are all in memory and the
 * formula value is the one the server hydrated on read, so ordering by what the
 * cell shows is honest — the same split #3096 made for relational columns.

/**
 * Gate 2 — the `getObjectSchema` chain (objectui#7007).
 *
 * Every verdict this file measures is a function of the FETCHED object schema:
 * `withheldFromServerSort` reads `objectSchema.fields[field]`, and with nothing
 * there it falls through to `isUnmaterializedFieldType(undefined)` — `false`,
 * i.e. "offer the sort". So a block that has only settled the FETCH chain is
 * reading the value one promise resolution too early: the row/table is
 * committed and populated, and the schema-dependent half of it is not.
 *
 * Measured, not assumed: with the timing fact mutated and nothing else — the
 * mock schema resolving after a 50ms delay instead of on the first microtask —
 * the block's own gate passes, `Quantity`/`Unit Price`/`Sequence` are present,
 * and `Total` is present too, so the assertions below go red. It is green on
 * `main` only because that effect is declared before the fetch effect and both
 * mocks resolve on the same microtask; nothing pins that ordering.
 *
 * ⚠️ The blocks KEEP their existing gate (objectui#6959's precedent, and its
 * trap). The two gates prove different facts — the first that the view
 * committed with rows at all, which is what makes a `queryBy…(…)).toBeNull()`
 * below non-vacuous; the second that the schema the verdict is derived from has
 * landed. Trading one for the other would leave the block blind on whichever
 * side it dropped.
 *
 * ⛔ `expect(getObjectSchema).toHaveBeenCalled()` is NOT this gate, for the
 * reason #6959 records: a mock CALL is ISSUED one resolution before its value
 * reaches state. It is used here only to get hold of the promise; the gate is
 * awaiting that same promise — the component registered its
 * `.then(setObjectSchema)` on it first, so our continuation runs after that
 * setter — and flushing the commit through `act`.
