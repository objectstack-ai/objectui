/**
 * `flex`, `object-grid` and `object-chart` declare the node-level
 * `responsiveStyles` that `@objectstack/spec`'s `PageComponentSchema` declares
 * on every page component, by reference, from the same fragment as the
 * public-block arms (objectui#10872, batch 9).
 *
 * ## The defect these pin
 *
 * Batch 8 declared the key on the 30 public-block arms. Objectstack's showcase
 * and its UI skill also write it on nodes of three arms outside that set:
 * `flex`, `object-grid` and `object-chart`. That reading is recorded on
 * objectui#10872, and nothing here re-derives it. `SchemaRenderer` compiles
 * the key to id-scoped CSS on every node (ADR-0065), but these three arms did
 * not declare it, so:
 *
 *   - the STRICT authoring face refused a spec-valid node by name
 *     (`unrecognized_keys`), and
 *   - the TOLERANT face passed it unjudged: `responsiveStyles: 7`, or a
 *     breakpoint the spec does not have (`md`), parsed clean and styled
 *     nothing.
 *
 * ## What is and is not widened
 *
 * The three arms spread the ONE shared fragment the public-block arms spread,
 * `PAGE_COMPONENT_ENVELOPE`, so the member is the same object on all 33 arms.
 *
 * ⚠️ objectui#11276 moved `object-chart`'s AUTHORED arm into the public-block
 * set (`ObjectChartBlockSchema`, its props in the `properties` bag), and its
 * `object-grid` batch moved `object-grid`'s the same way
 * (`ObjectGridBlockSchema`), so the authored chart and grid arms are pinned
 * with the other public blocks in `./public-block-responsive-styles-10872.test.ts`.
 * Its `flex` batch moved `flex`'s authored arm to the bag too
 * (`FlexBlockSchema`), which stays in the layout union, outside the public-block
 * set: so the population below is that one arm, `flex`, whose nodes now carry
 * their props in the bag beside the node-level key. The flat `FlexSchema`,
 * `ObjectChartSchema` and `ObjectGridSchema` mirrors keep the shared member as
 * the post-hoist reading.
 * The key is NOT declared on `BaseSchema` and NOT on any arm without a measured
 * producer: `grid`, `stack` and `container` below are the control, and the
 * whole arm list is read at run time so an arm that gains the member silently
 * turns this file red. The published TypeScript twins declare it too, as the
 * spec's `ResponsiveStyles` type by reference, so the mirror-parity census
 * measures no mirrored-but-undeclared key on these pairs.
 *
 * Every verdict is read against the INSTALLED spec at run time: the member is
 * compared with the spec's own `ResponsiveStylesSchema`, and a refusal is
 * compared with the issue the spec itself emits for the same value.
