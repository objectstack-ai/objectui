 * objectui#8769 — a `provider: 'value'` gantt honours the three query keys the
 * fetching path honours: `filter`, `sort`, and the objectui#7210 row ceiling.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `reload` short-circuited the inline provider (`setData(dataItems)`; return)
 * BEFORE `effectiveDataSource.find(...)`, which is the ONE site that lowers
 * `schema.filter` to `$filter`, `schema.sort` to `$orderby` and the ceiling to
 * `$top`. An authored `filter` therefore reached nothing and every inline row
 * was charted — the fail-OPEN direction: the key that was ignored is the key
 * that NARROWS, so the author saw MORE rows than declared, with no diagnostic.
 *
 * ⛔ Not a data-exposure boundary. The rows are already in the authored schema;
 * what is wrong is that the chart answers a question nobody asked.
 *
 * ## The two-sided reading is the finding
 *
 * A one-sided reproduction cannot tell "the filter was ignored" from "the
 * filter matched everything", so the first case renders the SAME rows and the
 * SAME filter twice — once inline, once through a context adapter — and reads
 * the DISAGREEMENT. The adapter is a `ValueDataSource` over the same rows, so
 * the matcher is literally the same object on both sides and the only variable
 * left is which branch of `reload` ran.
 *
 * ## ORDER: filter first, ceiling second (objectui#7210 ruling a′)
 *
 * The ceiling is applied to the FILTERED set, matching the fetching path
 * exactly — there `$filter` and `$top` travel in one query and every backend
 * filters before it limits. `ceilingOrder` pins it from the observable side: a
 * set that is over the ceiling BEFORE filtering and under it after draws every
 * matching row and shows NO footnote. A ceiling-then-filter implementation
 * would draw at most 2,000 rows there and would still footnote.
 *
 * ## The `never capped by us` case this file replaces
 *
 * `ObjectGantt.rowCeiling-7210.test.tsx` asserted that an inline set is never
 * capped and never footnoted. That case pinned the SHORT-CIRCUIT's behaviour,
 * not ruling a′: the ruling's own budget is measured in DOM ELEMENTS PER
 * RECORD (its table was measured over "real child views, inline `value`
 * provider"), and an inline row costs the browser exactly what a fetched row
 * costs. Nothing in the ruling text carves the provider out. So the exemption
 * moves here, inverted, with the triage ruling on objectui#8769 as its
 * authority — and `ceilingNote` below is what makes the cut loud rather than
 * silent, which is the half ruling a′ actually protects.
 *
 * ## Live adjacency, measured (objectui#9001 / PR objectui#9049)
 *
 * That card makes core's `convertFiltersToAST` THROW `FilterOperatorError` for
 * an `$icontains` comparand that is not a non-empty string. This repair does
 * NOT inherit it: the inline provider resolves to `ValueDataSource`, whose
 * matcher is local — it imports `@object-ui/types`, `@objectstack/spec/data`
 * and `./batchTransaction.js`, and never the converter, which is reached only
 * by `@object-ui/data-objectstack` on the wire path. `refusedComparandDoesNotThrow`
 * pins the consequence from the outside: a render, not a throw.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted BEFORE running, from the committed
 * fix, by restoring the short-circuit: `twoSidedFilter`, `inlineSort`,
 * `staticDataSpelling`, `ceilingCap`, `ceilingNote` and `ceilingOrder` go RED;
 * `control` and `refusedComparandDoesNotThrow` stay GREEN (the control draws
 * the same rows in the same order either way, which is what makes it a
 * control).
