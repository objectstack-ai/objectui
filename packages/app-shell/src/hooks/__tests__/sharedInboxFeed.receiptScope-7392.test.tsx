 * objectui#7392 — the inbox tick asks for the receipts it can USE, not the
 * user's whole receipt history.
 *
 * ## What was measured, and what it cost
 *
 * Every inbox tick issued `sys_notification_receipt` filtered by `user_id` +
 * `channel:'inbox'` with `$top: 200` and no cursor of any kind, beside the
 * `sys_inbox_message` read's `$top: 20` — at 10 s foregrounded, 60 s hidden.
 * `mergeInboxRows` then used the receipts as a lookup table keyed by
 * `notification_id` while mapping over the MESSAGE rows, so a receipt outside
 * that window of 20 was fetched, indexed, and dropped. Two orders of magnitude
 * of payload, re-fetched in full six times a minute, to decorate at most 20
 * rows.
 *
 * ## The one way this could have gone silently wrong — and why it does not
 *
 * The receipt set feeds the bell's badge, and a receipt is not a "read" marker:
 * `delivered` is a receipt and is NOT read (`READ_STATES`). So "read only the
 * receipts of the listed messages" invites the failure of turning an unread
 * TOTAL into "unread among the newest 20" with no error and no red test.
 *
 * It does not, and the reason is upstream of this change. The badge is
 * `unreadTopics + pendingApprovalsCount` (`InboxPopover`), and `unreadTopics`
 * folds the rows this feed produces — `mergeInboxRows`' output, which is one
 * row per `sys_inbox_message` row and therefore bounded by that read's
 * `$top: 20`, never by the receipt set. Home's `unreadTopicCount` (#4329)
 * folds the same rows with the same function. The inbox addend has been
 * window-sized since #4225 gave both surfaces one feed; the receipts only ever
 * supplied read-state to rows the MESSAGE query had already chosen. Narrowing
 * them to those same rows' ids therefore changes no number — which is what the
 * `badge` case below asserts against a fixture holding 180 receipts that the
 * narrowing drops.
 *
 * ## Why the fake backend honours the filter
 *
 * A fake that ignores `$filter` answers every query with the same rows, so the
 * "after" row count would echo the fixture rather than measure the read. This
 * one applies `user_id`, `channel` and `$in` and then `$top`, so the number of
 * rows a tick delivers is a reading of the query the feed actually wrote.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification (direction predicted BEFORE running, measured in the PR)
 *
 *   - restore the old read (`{ user_id, channel }`, `$top: 200`, unconditional)
 *     and the three payload cases go RED — the delivered row count returns to
 *     the whole history and the `$in` comparand is gone — while the `badge` and
 *     `read-state` cases stay GREEN. That asymmetry is the whole finding: the
 *     old read was wider, not more correct.
 *   - drop the `notification_id` clause but keep `$top: ids.length` and the
 *     payload count case still goes RED with a different number, so the case is
 *     reading the FILTER and not just the ceiling.
