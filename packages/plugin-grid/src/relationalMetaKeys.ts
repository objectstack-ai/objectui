 * ⭐ WHAT `ObjectGrid` COPIES OFF AN OBJECT-SCHEMA FIELD DEF ONTO A COLUMN'S
 * `fieldMeta` — objectui#6875.
 *
 * ## The defect this file exists to make unrepeatable
 *
 * `RELATIONAL_META_KEYS` used to be a bare array literal inside `ObjectGrid.tsx`,
 * governed by a rule stated in prose: *every key here has to have a measured
 * reader on this grid's own render path*. The rule was right; nothing enforced
 * it in the OTHER direction. The list was a strict SUBSET of what its own
 * consumers read, and had been for as long as anyone had looked:
 *
 *   copied, never read   — none (objectui#6711 and objectui#6874 closed that half)
 *   read, never copied   — `displayField`, `descriptionField`, `lookupColumns`,
 *                          `reference_field`, `lookup_columns`
 *
 * The list was also internally inconsistent about spelling, which is the tell
 * that it was assembled from defect reports rather than derived: `lookupFilters`
 * (camel) sat in it next to `lookup_filters`, while `displayField` and
 * `descriptionField` did NOT sit next to their snake twins. Same fallback
 * chains, same file, opposite outcomes.
 *
 * So the fix is not a longer literal. {@link RELATIONAL_META_READ_SET} below
 * classifies EVERY key the consumers read off this bag, and
 * `__tests__/relationalMetaCopySet.derivation.test.ts` re-derives that read set
 * from the consumer sources on every run. A spelling added to any consumer
 * chain lands in neither column of the table and turns the gate red; it cannot
 * silently become a sixth never-copied key.
 *
 * ## The consumers, and why they are exactly these three
 *
 * `generateColumns()` hands `fieldMeta` to `CellRenderer` as the `field` prop,
 * and `getCellRenderer` dispatches a relational column into
 * `LookupCellRenderer` (`@object-ui/fields/src/index.tsx`). The grid's inline
 * editor renders `LookupField` and `UserField`
 * (`@object-ui/fields/src/widgets/`); `UserField` reads a few keys itself and
 * then spreads its whole meta into `LookupField` — so its own read set is a
 * subset and it adds nothing; it is swept anyway, because a key it read and
 * did NOT forward would otherwise be invisible here.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Only the FIRST of those three is fed by this bag — objectui#7154
 *
 * This docblock used to say the inline editor "dispatches the same bag" into
 * the two widgets. It does not, and the correction matters because it is what
 * a whole class of card is filed against: `ObjectGrid.renderCellEditor` looks
 * the field up in the object schema and spreads the WHOLE def into the widget
 * (`{ name: ctx.column.accessorKey, ...fieldDef }`), so every key a def carries
 * reaches `LookupField` regardless of this table. `fieldMeta` goes to
 * `<CellRenderer>` and nowhere else.
 *
 * Both halves read `objectSchema?.fields?.[name]` — the same object — so there
 * is no shape where copying could rescue an editor the schema read did not
 * already serve: when that lookup misses, `renderCellEditor` returns `null` and
 * `applyRelationalMeta` copies nothing, together.
 *
 * ⇒ A key whose only reader is one of the two EDITOR widgets gains nothing from
 * being copied here, and copying it would write a member onto a bag its
 * consumer does not read — the shape objectui#6711 and objectui#6874 retired.
 * The four keys objectui#7154 asked about are measured arriving at the picker
 * with this table unchanged, in
 * `__tests__/lookupPickerKeys-7154.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## ⭐ THREE KEYS LEFT THIS COPY SET BY THAT RULE — objectui#7166
 *
 * objectui#7154 stated the rule for keys that had never been copied. Applied
 * BACKWARDS, to keys already on the list, the same rule retires three of them:
 * `descriptionField`, `lookupColumns` and `lookupFilters`. Each is read off a
 * field meta only by `LookupField` (and `lookupFilters` also by `UserField`) —
 * the two EDITOR widgets — so on the cell path each write landed on a bag whose
 * consumer never looks at it. Re-measured on `47035ce79`, and stated as
 * receivers rather than as a count: `packages/fields/src/index.tsx`, the file
 * that holds EVERY `CellRenderer`, contains zero occurrences of any of the
 * three, against a control of 22 occurrences of the `display_field` /
 * `displayField` / `reference_to` spellings the cell does read.
 *
 * ⇒ The retirement is behaviour-preserving, and that is the half worth pinning:
 * all three still take effect in the inline picker with them OFF this table,
 * because `renderCellEditor` hands the widget the whole schema def.
 * `__tests__/relationalMetaCopySet-7166.test.tsx` renders both halves.
 *
 * ## ⭐ THE TWO POPULATIONS — settled by objectui#7155, not by a reader sweep
 *
 * Six copied keys had no reader on this bag; three left in objectui#7166. The
 * other three — `description_field`, `lookup_filters`, `id_field` — were held
 * back as `legacy-alias`, on a PRODUCER-side argument no reader measurement
 * could answer: a host `DataSource` outside these two repos might hand-feed
 * them.
 *
 * That question is now CLOSED, and the answer was not the expected one. The
 * host feeding snake_case was THIS REPO: `@object-ui/types` declared the snake
 * spellings on `LookupFieldMetadata` / `UserFieldMetadata` and REFUSED the
 * camelCase ones, `content/docs/fields/lookup.mdx` taught that dialect as
 * normative, and CI compiled those snippets on every run. Two published
 * contracts disagreed about one concept, and the read chains here served both.
 *
 * objectui#7155 converged them on the spec's camelCase in one payment: the
 * widget contract was renamed, the docs and all seven in-repo producers moved
 * with it, and the snake legs left the chains. So the four spellings are not
 * "retired on reader evidence" — the dialect that produced them no longer
 * exists.
 *
 * ## ⭐ THE DERIVATION IS SCOPED TO THE CELL — objectui#7187
 *
 * That gap is closed. Until objectui#7187 the gate extracted ONE set, the UNION
 * over the three consumers, and a copy-set entry was licensed by membership in
 * it. Membership there means "some consumer reads this key" and never "this bag
 * is how that consumer gets it" — different claims, and only the second
 * justifies a copy. Reading the first as the second is what put
 * `descriptionField` and `lookupColumns` on this table (objectui#6875) and what
 * objectui#7166 then had to undo.
 *
 * So the reader axis is now recorded PER CONSUMER on every entry
 * ({@link RelationalMetaEntry.readers}), and the gate checks each declared list
 * against that consumer's own source in BOTH directions. The copy set is
 * derived from {@link CONSUMERS_FED_THIS_BAG} alone. A key only the editor
 * widgets read can no longer be copied by editing a verdict, because no verdict
 * says "copy this" any more — copying follows the measured cell reader, and
 * the one deliberate exception has to name itself per key
 * ({@link RelationalMetaEntry.copiedWithoutCellReader}).
 *
 * ⇒ Putting any of the three retired keys back now turns the gate red on a
 * DERIVED assertion. The named-key pin in
 * `__tests__/relationalMetaCopySet.derivation.test.ts` and the rendering test
 * `__tests__/relationalMetaCopySet-7166.test.tsx` are kept so a regression is
 * reported by name — they are no longer the only hold.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Why a key can be READ and still not be worth copying
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0's `FieldSchema` is a **strict** object of 71
 * properties. A key it does not declare parses to `unrecognized_keys` — the
 * same code a nonsense key gets — so `PUT /api/v1/meta/object/:name` refuses
 * it and no spec-compliant producer can put it on a field def. Measured on the
 * installed package, with `name` / `type` / `label` as the positive control.
 *
 * Nothing manufactures one on the way in, either. `getObjectSchema` in
 * `@object-ui/data-objectstack` is the choke point every schema read passes
 * through, and its only key rewrites are `normalizeSchemaReferenceKeys` (the
 * `reference` ⇄ `reference_to` pair) and `applyFieldWidgetOverrides` (`widget`).
 * Whatever the server serves for every other property arrives verbatim.
 *
 * ⇒ Copying a key that is neither spec-declared nor adapter-stamped writes a
 * member from the def on every column build that no producer can ever fill.
 * That is precisely what objectui#6711 (`reference_to_field`), objectui#6625
 * (`decimals`) and objectui#6597 (`referenceTo`) retired, and what
 * objectui#6531 removed from `getRecordDisplayName` on the same reasoning. So
 * `reference_field` and `lookup_columns` — two of the five keys objectui#6875
 * named — are deliberately NOT copied, and the gate proves their absence from
 * `FieldSchema` rather than taking this docblock's word for it.
 *
 * ## ⭐ The asymmetry this file used to record — RESOLVED by objectui#7155
 *
 * Four keys in the copy set — `display_field`, `description_field`,
 * `lookup_filters`, `id_field` — failed that same producer test and were kept
 * as `legacy-alias`, because retiring a shipped key is its own adjudication
 * (objectui#6711 and objectui#6874 each were one).
 *
 * That adjudication happened: the maintainer ruled to converge the two
 * contracts rather than to sweep the reader. `display_field`,
 * `description_field` and `lookup_filters` are gone in favour of the spec
 * spellings they shadowed; `idField` stayed under a new verdict, because
 * objectstack#3508's machine-name hydration is a picker capability with no
 * object-metadata twin and none owed. The `legacy-alias` verdict itself is
 * retired — the class is empty and unrepresentable, and the gate below proves
 * the four spellings reach no consumer rather than trusting this paragraph.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Two keys were in this list and are RETIRED — do not re-add them
 *
 * Both were measured out under the same rule this file now enforces
 * mechanically: a key belongs here only when a consumer on THIS grid's render
 * path reads it off a FIELD meta. Under the derivation they can no longer be
 * re-added by hand at all — neither appears in the read set the gate extracts,
 * so adding either to the table below turns the gate red as an "extra".
 *
 * ### `reference_to_field` — objectui#6711
 *
 * Swept across `packages/` and `apps/` (and again across the producer repo),
 * the only occurrences of the identifier anywhere were the array literal — the
 * write — and prose recording that nothing reads it. No member access, no
 * destructuring, no bracket read. `FieldSchema` does not declare it either, so
 * nothing authorable produces it.
 *
 * ### `titleFormat` — objectui#6874
 *
 * A zero of a different kind, and a stronger one. `titleFormat` is a real, live
 * key with plenty of readers — it simply has no FIELD-meta reader. The sweep
 * found every member read of the identifier across `packages/` and `apps/`
 * (tests included) and classified each by receiver: `objectDef` /
 * `objectSchema` (`core/utils/record-title.ts`, `containers.tsx`,
 * `plugin-detail/DetailView.tsx`, `ObjectKanban.tsx`, `ObjectCalendar.tsx`,
 * `react/hooks/useRecordSearch.ts`) — OBJECT schema, every one;
 * `refObjectSchema?.titleFormat` in `LookupField.tsx` — the REFERENCED object's
 * schema, fetched by `getSchema(referenceTo)`, and the one that matters here;
 * `param.titleFormat` in `app-shell/utils/paramToField.ts`, off a resolved
 * `ActionParamDef`. ⇒ copying `reference_to` is what makes `titleFormat` work
 * on this path; copying `titleFormat` onto the meta reached nothing.
 * `plugin-dashboard/src/recordFields.tsx` recorded the same measurement first.
 *
 * Both absences stay pinned behaviourally at all three of `generateColumns`'s
 * call sites — `__tests__/relationalMetaCopySet-6711.test.tsx` and
 * `__tests__/relationalMetaCopySet-6874.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ⚠️ Every sweep quoted above bounds these two repos. A host application
 * outside them could still be reading any of these keys off `fieldMeta`; the
 * repo's own contract is what these verdicts are about.
