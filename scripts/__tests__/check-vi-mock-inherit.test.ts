/**
 * objectui#6849 — the test for `scripts/check-vi-mock-inherit.mjs`.
 *
 * ## Why this file carries more weight than usual
 *
 * The gate is GREEN AT REST: every `@object-ui/react` mock in the tree inherits
 * the real export surface, and the expectation is that they keep doing so. A
 * green run over this repo therefore proves only that the tree is clean — it
 * cannot tell a working gate from one that matches nothing, which is the exact
 * defect the gate exists to catch, one level up. Triage made the non-vacuity
 * control a delivery precondition for precisely that reason.
 *
 * So this file carries BOTH legs of the ablation, and neither is decoration:
 *
 *   - the POSITIVE control (`ablation`): the real historical instance,
 *     reconstructed byte-for-byte from `ObjectView.contractEnvelope-6726.test.tsx`
 *     as PR #6847 left it, driven end to end through `main()` for the exit code;
 *   - the NEGATIVE control (`the eleven`): every already-correct spelling the
 *     grep in #6768 mis-counted, each as its own case AND pinned against the
 *     real files on disk, because a gate that reddens on correct code gets
 *     deleted rather than fixed.
 *
 * ## Fixture discipline: never write a matchable call site into this source
 *
 * This file is inside the gate's own scan scope. Every fixture is built through
 * `mockCall()`, which interpolates the quote character — the source text here
 * reads `vi.${fn}(` and the pattern needs a literal `mock`/`doMock` followed by
 * a quote, so it never matches. Anything that DID match would be inside a string
 * literal, which the gate classifies as `embedded` and declines to judge anyway.
 * The first is what keeps the census figure honest. Same discipline, and the
 * same reasons, as `check-vi-mock-specifiers.test.ts`.

   * THE MEMBERSHIP LEDGER — objectui#8018.
   *
   * Every specifier a landed sweep has added, written out ONCE and BY HAND.
   * The gate's header declares the covered set GROW-ONLY and the ratchet's
   * whole force rests on that, but `findCallSites` classifies by MEMBERSHIP:
   * a specifier that leaves the set stops being `covered` and its call sites
   * become `unjudged`. So a removal does not redden — it makes that
   * specifier's whole population invisible while the gate reports OK over a
   * tree it no longer looks at. Measured before this ledger existed, by
   * dropping each of the 21 members from the constant in turn and running this
   * file: 18 of them left all 86 cases GREEN, together 384 judged call sites
   * — `@object-ui/auth` (136) and `@object-ui/permissions` (48) among them.
   *
   * ⛔ It is NOT derived from `COVERED_SPECIFIERS`. A pin that reads its
   * expectation from the thing it pins asserts `x === x` and cannot fail; the
   * cautionary example is already in this file, where the verdict-line case
   * builds its expectation with `COVERED_SPECIFIERS.join(', ')` and therefore
   * ADAPTS to a removal rather than resisting it. That is this repo's
   * recurring shape and it is the reason these names are typed out.
   *
   * The two cases below pin the list in BOTH directions, and the second is
   * what keeps a hand-written ledger from silently falling behind:
   *
   *   - nothing may LEAVE the covered set (the ratchet direction); and
   *   - nothing may JOIN it without being recorded here in the same PR, so a
   *     member added tomorrow arrives already pinned rather than joining an

   *      brace. Reproduced byte-for-byte in `the summary matcher survives the

   *      vitest's github-actions reporter and writes `::error file=…`
   *      annotations — which the CI log shows it did, decorating the parent's
   *      own run with failures from a fixture that is behaving correctly.
   *   3. `NO_COLOR` asks for uncoloured output. It is not relied on: the
   *      stripping above is what makes the assertions true either way. ⭐ It is
   *      stated at the call site rather than left to the environment, and that
