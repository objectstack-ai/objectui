/**
 * EnvironmentListToolbar — the state-aware replacement for the generic
 * `list_toolbar` action bar on the `sys_environment` list.
 *
 * The cloud serves ONE `create_environment` action; born-with-env makes its
 * meaning depend on org state (which the action metadata can't express). This
 * component reads the resolved entitlement state and renders the right
 * affordance:
 *   • no production env          → "Set up your production environment" (primary);
 *                                  the create POST provisions the org's one
 *                                  production env — the historical-data path that
 *                                  must never error.
 *   • has prod + dev allowed     → "Add development environment" (the create POST
 *                                  makes a dev env).
 *   • has prod + dev NOT allowed → "Add environment" that opens an UPGRADE prompt
 *                                  instead of POST-ing into a 403.
 *   • still resolving            → a SKELETON where the create button will land —
 *                                  no label at all (see below).
 *   • settled with no signal     → the action's metadata label (neutral), with the
 *                                  apiHandler entitlement dialog as the safety net.
 *
 * Create flows reuse the standard `action:bar` runner (name modal → apiHandler),
 * so only the label/variant changes — no duplicate POST logic here.
 *
 * ## Why a skeleton while resolving (cloud#1049 → objectui#3482)
 *
 * Rendering the metadata label while entitlements were in flight made the button
 * visibly change its wording mid-load: the cloud action metadata's "create
 * environment" label, replaced by `environment.setUpProduction` the moment
 * `/cloud/environment-entitlements` answered. Locale-independent by mechanism,
 * though it was reported against the Chinese console, where the two texts are
 * owned by different packages and the swap read as an inconsistency rather than
 * a load. The maintainer's ruling on cloud#1049 was option A — present nothing
 * rather than a label we are about to overwrite. Same shape as the adjacent
 * `cloud:onboarding-next` welcome CTA (`console/home/CloudOnboardingNext.tsx`):
 * loading → neutral skeleton sized like the button, unknown/error → degrade to a
 * working button. Option B (a neutral label for every state) was rejected: it is
 * semantically wrong for an org that already owns its production environment.
 *
 * ## Who owns this button's text (the "two sources" question)
 *
 * There is no longer one string with two owners — there are two DIFFERENT strings
 * for two different states, and each has exactly one owner:
 *
 *   • Every RESOLVED state → THIS package. `environment.setUpProduction` /
 *     `environment.addDevelopment` / `environment.addEnvironment` in
 *     `packages/i18n/src/locales/*.ts` are the sole source of truth. The cloud
 *     action metadata's `_actions.create_environment.label` translation CANNOT
 *     reach the button here — `decideEnvironmentCta()` is total over `ready`
 *     state, so a resolved state always overrides the label.
 *   • Still resolving → nothing (skeleton).
 *   • Settled with NO usable signal (`ready: false`, `source: 'unknown'` — the
 *     summary endpoint was unusable AND the row-derivation threw) → the metadata
 *     label, deliberately. It is the one state where "which create is this?" is
 *     genuinely unknown, so the producer's neutral wording is the only honest
 *     text. This is the metadata label's ONLY surviving path on this button; the
 *     cloud-side bundle entry therefore still has a job and must not be deleted
 *     (reported back on cloud#1049 for the cloud seat).

 * Deep-link support (#844, re-based onto the DECLARED slot by objectui#5216):
 * an object nav entry declaring `runAction: 'create_environment'` resolves to
 * an environments href carrying `?runAction=`, and landing on it auto-opens the
 * create dialog once entitlements have resolved — so the welcome page's "Create
 * your environment" CTA lands the user IN the dialog instead of on the list,
 * hunting for a second create button.
 *
 * Read-once / consume-once now lives in {@link useNavRunAction}, shared with the
 * generic object list; this wrapper contributes only the environment-specific
 * arming condition. What it retires: the bare `'runAction'` literal read off
 * `window.location.search` and compared to a hard-coded action name — a private
 * convention with a second copy at the producing end and no schema behind
 * either.
 *
 * ## Arming is destructive — only arm when there is something to trigger (#4123)
 *
 * Consumption is modelled as "strip the param", so arming SPENDS a one-shot
 * user intent. Arm it when nothing can act on it and the intent is not merely
 * lost, it is unrecoverable: the URL no longer carries it, so a reload cannot
 * retry. Hence both conjuncts below: the create action must actually be on the
 * bar (`hasCreateAction`), AND entitlements must have resolved — `upgrade_...`
 * routes to the upgrade dialog instead, and while loading we must not trigger
 * an action whose meaning (prod vs dev create) isn't known yet. When either
 * fails, the honest degradation is to leave the URL alone: the next mount that
 * CAN act on the deep link still does.
 *
 * A requested name this toolbar does not answer to is the same "leave it alone"
 * case — see `useNavRunAction` on why the client degrades quietly while the
 * AUTHORING tier rejects the undefined reference loudly.
