/**
 * Which lint scope a SCHEMA-DRIVEN condition editor claims, decided by the
 * metadata type being edited (objectui#8167).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `SchemaForm` routes a field to the CEL condition builder by NAME CONVENTION
 * (`visible` / `hidden` / `disabled` / `visibleOn` / `condition` / `predicate`
 * / `*When`), so one widget serves every metadata type. It claimed no scope, so
 * every such field fell through to `celAuthoring`'s own `hint.scope ??
 * 'flattened'` default — and a bare `status == 'done'` typed into an action's
 * **Visible when** linted CLEAN while the runtime binds the row as the `record`
 * ROOT and never matches it. The editor issued a receipt the runtime refuses.
 *
 * ## Why a TABLE and not one value
 *
 * The widget's surface is whatever the host schema points it at, so no single
 * scope is right for it: `record` is right where the evaluator binds a row, and
 * refusing the bare shorthand on the flow / RLS tiers — which are NOT row
 * surfaces (objectui#5738 stand-down 3) — would narrow a surface with no defect.
 * The one place that knows which tier is on screen is the host that is editing
 * a metadata type, so the scope originates there and rides
 * {@link WidgetContext.conditionScope}, required at construction.
 *
 * ## The verdicts are RULED, not derived here
 *
 * Every row below is the director seat's ruling of 2026-09-17 (batch #150 item
 * 5, letter B with the derivation table; maintainer 「同意」), which applies the
 * earlier rule — *a mount's lint scope is decided by what the evaluator binds at
 * runtime* — once per tier, from readings already taken on that thread:
 *
 *   • action `visible` / `disabled` / `enabled` → `record`: a row surface by
 *     `rowPredicateCanon.ts`'s own words.
 *   • validation rule `condition` → `record`: objectql's rule validator binds
 *     `{ record, previous }` and fail-closes on an unevaluable predicate, so a
 *     bare reference rejects every write to the object.
 *   • hook `condition` → `record`: `wrapDeclarativeHook` evaluates it as
 *     `{ record: record ?? {}, previous }` and throws on an unevaluable one.
 *     Landed at the curated hook inspector in objectui#9643; this is the same
 *     verdict reaching the generic form.
 *   • flow node `condition` → `flattened`: the flow tier is not a row surface.
 *   • permission / RLS row condition → `flattened`: RLS is not a row surface.
 *   • page block `visibleWhen` → `none`: its evaluator binds `record` +
 *     `current_user` + `page.<var>`, and NEITHER lint scope expresses that set —
 *     at `record` the validator refuses `page.<var>`, which is the spec's own
 *     worked example for the key, with the nonsense remedy `record.page`. It
 *     becomes `record` once the engine gains the `page` root (objectstack#18554
 *     or the no-objectstack fourth option recorded there); ⛔ this card does not
 *     wait on it.
 *   • any type without a row → `none`.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not re-open a row here. A tier whose runtime binding has actually
 * CHANGED is a new reading and a new ruling, not an edit to this table.
 *
 * ## `none` is a decision, not an absence
 *
 * `none` routes the field to the plain editor with no lint claim at all — the
 * option-D shape, taken per row. It is NOT the same as omitting a scope: an
 * omitted scope still renders the builder and still lets `celAuthoring`'s
 * `flattened` default answer, which is the receipt-for-nothing this card exists
 * to stop.
 *
 * ## The table is exhaustive over the types the editor serves
 *
 * A type reaching this table with no row would take `none` silently — a lint
 * claim dropped by omission, which is exactly how the defect got in. So the
 * runtime fallback is `none` (a new type must never crash the editor) and
 * `ConditionWidget.conditionScope.test.tsx` is what makes it LOUD: it
 * enumerates the registered metadata resources and reddens on the first type
 * that has no row here.

/**

 * ## Why {@link ConditionScope} cannot answer this, and a second table must
 *
 * The scope table gives `action`, `hook` and `validation` the same `'record'`,
 * and that verdict is right for all three — each evaluator binds the row as the
 * `record` ROOT. But `'record'` is a claim about how the CEL is LINTED, not a
 * claim about what the host BINDS, and on that second question the three
 * disagree: two are evaluated on the SERVER, one in the BROWSER. So one value
 * covers two different binding sets, and any single subject vocabulary declared
 * at the generic mount would be correct for one tier and wrong for the other.
 *
 * `RECORD_CONDITION_SUBJECTS` refuses to derive its narrowing from
 * `scope === 'record'` for precisely this reason, and says so in its own words.
 * This table is the other end of that refusal: the fact the component cannot
 * see, supplied by the one place that knows which metadata type is on screen.

/**
 * The measured host per metadata type, PARTIAL over the ruled table on purpose.
 *
 * ## Why partial, and what keeps it honest anyway
 *
 * A row here is a MEASUREMENT of a real evaluator, so a type whose condition
 * nobody has put to an evaluator must have no row rather than a guessed one.
 * Every absent type therefore derives no narrowing at all and the builder keeps
 * its own default vocabulary — byte for byte what it offered before this table
 * existed.
 *
 * Two things stop that from becoming the silent-default defect this card is
 * about. The `satisfies Partial<Record<RuledMetadataType, …>>` below ties the
 * KEY SET to the ruled scope table, so a key that is not a ruled metadata type
 * is a compile error here. And `ConditionWidget.conditionSubjects.test.tsx`
 * requires a row for every type the scope table rules `'record'` — the tiers
 * where a subject vocabulary is actually offered — so a new row-surface type
 * reddens there instead of inheriting `user.*` unremarked.
 *
 * ## The readings behind each row, re-derived at source in objectstack
 *
 *  • `hook` → `server`. `wrapDeclarativeHook`'s pre-compiled condition calls
 *    `ExpressionEngine.evaluate<boolean>(expr, { record: record ?? {}, previous })`
 *    and throws when the result is not `ok`, so an unevaluable predicate aborts
 *    the operation rather than resolving false. Two bindings, no `user`.
 *  • `validation` → `server`. A rule's `condition` goes through `checkPredicate`
 *    and its `when` through `checkConditional`; both evaluate against
 *    `{ record, previous }` and both return an `unevaluableRuleError` when the
 *    predicate cannot be evaluated — the rule validator's own log line calls
 *    that outcome "rejected, not skipped". Two bindings, no `user`.
 *  • `action` → `client`. An action's `visible` / `disabled` are evaluated in
 *    the browser, where `buildExpressionScope` (`ExpressionProvider`) returns a
 *    bag carrying `user` (alongside `current_user`, `ctx`, `os` and `features`)
 *    and the row arrives through `usePredicateRecordContext`. `user` is a
 *    subject an author can legitimately pick here, so this row exists to keep
 *    the narrowing OFF this tier — an omission would read the same way and
 *    claim nothing.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not add a row from a docblock or a card. A row is a reading taken at
 * the evaluator.
