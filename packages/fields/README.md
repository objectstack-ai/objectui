# @object-ui/fields

The standard field library and registry for Object UI.

## Features

- 📚 **Standard Fields** - Implementation of all ObjectStack protocol fields (Text, Number, Date, Lookup, etc.)
- 🔌 **Plugin System** - `registerFieldRenderer` registers custom renderers, or overrides standard ones.
- 🛠 **Helpers** - Utilities for schema mapping, validation, and expression evaluation.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @object-ui/fields
```

## Field Registry

The Field Registry is the core mechanism that allows decoupling view components from specific field implementations.

### Registering a Custom Field

You can override standard fields or add new ones:

```tsx
import { registerFieldRenderer, type CellRendererProps } from '@object-ui/fields';
import type { FC } from 'react';

// Your own renderer — anywhere in your app; it takes the standard props bag.
declare const MyCustomColorPicker: FC<CellRendererProps>;

// ⚠️ `color` is a SHIPPED type (`ColorSwatchCellRenderer`), and `getCellRenderer`
// reads the registry BEFORE the standard map — so this call OVERRIDES the
// built-in renderer. To ADD a type instead, register a name nothing ships.
registerFieldRenderer('color', MyCustomColorPicker);
```

### Using Standard Fields

View components use `getCellRenderer` to resolve the correct component for a field type.

```tsx
import { getCellRenderer, resolveCellRendererType, type CellRendererProps } from '@object-ui/fields';

const MyGridCell = ({ field, value }: CellRendererProps) => {
  // Resolve the renderer KEY first, then the renderer. A field's declared
  // `type` is not always the renderer's key: a textual field carrying a
  // format hint (`Field.text({ format: 'phone' })`) resolves to the richer
  // renderer. Passing `field.type` raw skips that mapping and draws such a
  // column as bare text, silently. Resolving first is never worse: with no
  // format hint the resolver returns the declared `type` unchanged.
  const Renderer = getCellRenderer(resolveCellRendererType(field));
  return <Renderer field={field} value={value} />;
};
```

## Standard Field Types

Supported types out of the box:

- **Basic**: `text`, `textarea`, `number`, `boolean`
- **Format**: `currency`, `percent`
- **Date**: `date`, `datetime`, `time`
- **Selection**: `select`, `lookup`, `master_detail`
- **Contact**: `email`, `phone`, `url`
- **Media**: `file`, `image`
- **System**: `formula`, `summary`, `auto_number`

### `type="number"` widgets: what is announced and what is not

`NumberField`, `CurrencyField`, `PercentField` and `GeolocationField` all render
a native `type="number"` input, so the **browser** decides what the box accepts.
They share one reading of that, in `widgets/numberBadInput.tsx`:

- **Announced.** When the browser reports `validity.badInput` — the box is
  holding text it cannot convert, e.g. a typed `1e`, which Chromium keeps
  DISPLAYING while `.value` reads `''` — the control is marked `aria-invalid`
  and draws a `Not saved: …` message, reusing objectui#6716's refusal shape.
  Both a change arm and a blur arm are wired, because pasting into an empty box
  never moves `.value` and so fires no React change event at all.
- ⚠️ **Not announced, and not announceable.** Entries the browser silently
  **truncates**: `1.2.3` stores `1.23`, `0x10` stores `10`. The characters are
  discarded as they arrive, before any handler here runs, so no widget-side
  guard can refuse them. Recovering them would mean abandoning `type="number"`
  and with it the mobile numeric keyboard and the `min`/`max`/`step` spinner
  (objectui#2572).

⛔ Silence therefore means "the browser read *something*", never "the value is
correct". User-facing wording lives in
[the fields guide](../../content/docs/guide/fields.md). The measured browser vs
happy-dom matrix is in `src/__tests__/numberInputBrowserReadings.ts`.

### Rendering form field widgets outside the form

The full widget surface is exported for consumers that render field widgets
outside a record form (ADR-0059):

- `FORM_FIELD_TYPES` — the frozen list of every type the form can render.
- `resolveFormWidgetType(type)` — resolves any field-type spelling to its
  widget key (spec aliases like `toggle`/`json`/`secret` included; unknown
  types fall back to `text`, mirroring the form).
- `getLazyFieldWidget(type)` — the widget wrapped in `React.lazy` (cached per
  type; render inside `<Suspense>`), sharing the same loaders `registerField`
  uses so nothing is bundled eagerly.

The app-shell `ActionParamDialog` uses these to render declared action params
through the exact same widgets as the object form — with a drift test pinning
param support ⊇ form support.

### File uploads in line-item grids

`GridField` (the master-detail line-items grid) supports `type: 'file'` columns:
the cell renders a compact upload button plus removable file chips (thumbnails
for images) instead of degrading to a text input, so users can attach a receipt
or photo per row without opening the row form (objectui#2360). Columns accept
`accept?: string[]` and `multiple?: boolean`; uploads run through the same
`UploadProvider` pipeline as the full-size `FileField` (the compact control is
exported as `FileCell`). Auto-derived subform columns map `file`/`image`/
`avatar` fields to file columns instead of dropping them.

### Multi-value selects

A `select` field declared `multiple: true` selects zero-or-more values (spec
allows `multiple` on `select`). `SelectField` delegates to the multi-value chip
picker (the same widget the `multiselect` type uses) and stores a `string[]`.
Delegating inside `SelectField` — rather than at a type-resolution layer — means
every surface that renders the `select` widget (the object form, the inline grid
editor, and the app-shell `ActionParamDialog`) gets multi-select identically,
with no per-surface drift. Both single- and multi-value selects resolve
per-option `visibleWhen` cascading and `dependsOn` gating through the same
[`useCascadingOptions`](./src/widgets/useCascadingOptions.ts) hook, so the
offered chips narrow (and now-invalid selections are pruned) exactly as the
single dropdown does.

### Cascading & role-gated select options

`select`, `multiselect`, `radio`, and `checkboxes` options support a per-option
`visibleWhen` CEL predicate (offered only when TRUE, evaluated against the live
record + `current_user`) and a field-level `dependsOn`. Together they drive
dependent selects (country → province → city) and role-gated options with no
bespoke matrix — the same primitives dependent lookups use. All four widgets
resolve this through the shared [`useCascadingOptions`](./src/widgets/useCascadingOptions.ts)
hook, which wraps the pure `resolveCascadingOptions` helper in `@object-ui/core`
(also used by the form renderer's inline pre-filter, so gating and filtering
never drift). While a `dependsOn` parent is empty the control is gated; a parent
change re-filters the list and clears a now-invalid value (scalar `select` /
`radio` drop the value; multi-value `multiselect` / `checkboxes` prune just the
offered-out entries).
An option whose `label` is blank (the empty string is a legal label; an absent one is
not) displays its `value` instead of an empty row, on the editable and the read-only
path alike — all eight read sites across the four widgets share the one
`optionDisplayLabel` helper in `@object-ui/core` (objectui#9230).
Client-side hiding is UX only — gate authorization-sensitive values on the
server too. See
[`content/docs/fields/select.mdx`](../../content/docs/fields/select.mdx).
