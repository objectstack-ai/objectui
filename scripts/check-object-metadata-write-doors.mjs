/**
 * Every in-repo DOOR that can PUT an object-metadata document must apply the
 * object-metadata write invariant.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/check-object-metadata-write-doors.mjs   (also `pnpm check:metadata-write-doors`)
 *       node scripts/check-object-metadata-write-doors.mjs --list   (the whole derived door census)
 * Exit: 0 = every object-capable door reaches `assertObjectMetadataWritable`,
 *       1 = at least one does not, or the census collapsed.
 *
 * ## The defect class this closes (objectui#8676, from objectui#7714 / objectui#8057)
 *
 * objectui#7714 ruled a client behaviour — a half-filled relationship is held
 * client-side and the PUT body never carries one without a non-empty
 * `reference` — and its PR implemented that ruling by ENUMERATING the writers it
 * knew of. Two of them. objectui#8057 then hit the same defect on a third writer
 * in that card's own required dogfood, and objectui#8676's sweep found nine
 * more. The sentence that outlives all three cards:
 *
 * > a ruling that enumerates writers is only as good as the enumeration.
 *
 * ⭐ And the half that outlives even that: the sweep the question is naturally
 * asked in CANNOT SEE its own subject. `git grep 'client\.save('` returns ZERO
 * over `ResourceEditPage.tsx`, the file objectui#8057 is entirely about, because
 * the call is `client.save<any>(type, …)` and the generic argument sits between
 * the name and the paren. A second writer hides identically. A third method
 * (`client.meta.saveItem(`) is not that spelling at all. And the door this gate
 * found that no `.save`-shaped sweep of any spelling can see is
 * `importObjectDraft`, a hand-rolled `fetch` PUT to `/api/v1/meta/object/:name`.
 *
 * ⇒ So this gate does not enumerate writers, and ⛔ no fix for this class ever
 * should. It enumerates DOORS.
 *
 * ## Why doors, and why that is not the same trick with a shorter list
 *
 * The writer set is OPEN — any component may decide to save an object, and
 * nothing in the repo has to tell anyone when one is added. The door set is
 * CLOSED and this repository owns it: bytes reach `PUT /meta/:type/:name` only
 * through code that is in this tree. So the census below is derived from the
 * TRANSPORT — what actually issues the request — and every writer, named or
 * not, past or future, arrives through one of the doors it finds. A writer
 * added tomorrow needs no entry anywhere; a DOOR added tomorrow reddens this
 * gate by construction, because the census is re-derived on every run.
 *
 * That is the difference between this and a list. A list is a claim about the
 * world; this is a measurement of the tree.
 *
 * ## The census, stated as a rule
 *
 *   DOORS     over `packages/<pkg>/src/**` and `apps/<app>/src/**`, excluding
 *             tests:
 *               (A) RAW — a call carrying a `method: 'PUT'` object literal at
 *                   any argument position, one of whose other arguments RESOLVES
 *                   to a URL on the `/meta` path. ⭐ Resolved, not read: the
 *                   repo's central door spells its URL through a template, a
 *                   field, and a helper's return value, and says nothing at the
 *                   call site. See {@link resolveUrl}.
 *               (B) SDK — any call to a member named `saveItem` with three or
 *                   more arguments. That is `@objectstack/client`'s metadata
 *                   write door, which lives in a package this repo does not own
 *                   and therefore cannot be guarded from the inside.
 *   TYPE      for (A) the literal path segment following `/meta/`, when the URL
 *             spells one; for (B) the first argument, when it is a string
 *             literal. Anything else is UNKNOWN.
 *   CAPABLE   TYPE is `object`, or TYPE is UNKNOWN. A door whose type is a
 *             literal other than `object` cannot carry an object document and
 *             is exempt — `view`, `app`, `flow`, `dashboard` writes are not this
 *             invariant's business.
 *   GUARDED   the nearest enclosing function body contains a call to
 *             `assertObjectMetadataWritable`.
 *   FINDING   a CAPABLE door that is not GUARDED.
 *
 * ⭐ `MetadataClient.save` call sites are deliberately NOT in the census, and
 * that absence is the whole point rather than a gap: `MetadataClient.save` IS
 * door (A) at `packages/data-objectstack/src/metadata-client.ts`, so every one
 * of its callers is covered by guarding that single door. Enumerating them
 * would re-introduce exactly the list this gate exists to abolish.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT answer
 *
 * Each is a boundary, not an oversight:
 *
 *   1. **Writes that are not PUT.** `publish`, `reset` and `rollback` POST to
 *      `/meta/:type/:name/<verb>` with no body of fields; they promote or
 *      discard a document the door already judged. A future POST route that
 *      accepts a fields-bearing body would be outside this census.
 *   2. **A door built by indirection.** A `fetch` whose method string arrives in
 *      a variable, or whose URL is assembled far from the call, is not matched.
 *      The census is syntactic; it reads what is written at the call.
 *   3. **Whether a guarded door's body is CORRECT.** That is
 *      `object-metadata-write-guard.*.test.ts`'s job. This gate answers
 *      coverage, and coverage only — the same split objectui#8676 was graded on.
 *   4. **Metadata written by a consumer of the published packages.** A host app
 *      that builds its own client reaches the server without passing through
 *      this tree at all.
 *
 * ## Population self-proof
 *
 * A census that finds nothing passes while asserting nothing — the failure mode
 * objectui#8676 is a card about. So the gate refuses to report OK unless it
 * found at least one door of EACH kind and at least one guarded door. A refactor
 * that renames the transport turns this red rather than green.
