/**
 * objectui#9237 — `writeFields` silently DELETED a stored field named
 * `__proto__` from the PUT body, and the spec ACCEPTED the result.
 *
 * ## Why this class is worse than the 422s the sibling suites pin
 *
 * `object-fields-io.spec-keys.test.ts` and
 * `object-fields-io.referenceCarryover-8896.test.ts` both guard REFUSAL
 * shapes: a key the server rejects, loudly, leaving the stored document
 * untouched and a reload as the escape. This one had no refusal anywhere in
 * it. The old `writeFields` body was
 *
 *   const out: Record OF string TO unknown = {};
 *   for (const e of view.entries) out[e.name] = e.def;
 *
 * and `out['__proto__'] = def` does not create a key — it invokes
 * `Object.prototype`'s setter — so the entry `readFields` had just read back
 * was gone before `JSON.stringify` ever saw it. The resulting document is
 * perfectly spec-legal, the PUT succeeds, the server stores the object WITHOUT
 * the field, and nothing anywhere reports a thing. There is no reload that
 * recovers it, because the field is gone from the store.
 *
 * The trigger is an edit that never touched the field: all 14 `writeFields`
 * call sites across the object designer re-serialize the whole map on every
 * save and reorder.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Why this pin must say `__proto__` and nothing else
 *
 * `__proto__` is the ONLY name that reproduces. It is the single accessor on
 * `Object.prototype`; every other member (`constructor`, `toString`,
 * `valueOf`, `hasOwnProperty`, `prototype`) is a data property, and assignment
 * shadows a data property with a normal own property. A pin written with one
 * of those names is green under the repair AND green under the defect — it
 * asserts nothing. `the name table` below makes that failure mode an
 * executable assertion rather than a comment, so a later edit that "generalises"
 * this pin to a prototype-reachable name turns the suite red instead of
 * hollowing it out.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Why every fixture here is built by `JSON.parse`
 *
 * Writing the fixture as an object literal would silently void this file.
 * `{ __proto__: def }` in source is the prototype-setter form: it sets the
 * literal's prototype and creates NO own property, so `readFields` would emit
 * no entry and there would be nothing for `writeFields` to lose. Stored
 * metadata arrives over the wire as JSON, and `JSON.parse` creates a real own
 * property — that is both the faithful construction and the only one that
 * carries the defect. `the instrument` below asserts it rather than trusting
 * it.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not assert on `ObjectSchema.safeParse(...).data`. Measured on zod
 * 4.4.3: `z.record()` reports success and hands back an output object with the
 * `__proto__` entry MISSING — the same construction defect, one layer up, in a
 * dependency. Asserting on the validator's output instead of on the document
 * we built would make this file permanently red for a reason that has nothing
 * to do with `writeFields`.

 */
/*
 * ⛔ Written as JSON TEXT, never as `JSON.stringify({ __proto__: … })`. That
 * argument would be the prototype-setter literal, `stringify` would emit no
 * such key, and this file would pass while measuring nothing.
