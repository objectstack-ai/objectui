 * Pins for `scripts/body-dialect-census.mjs` (objectui#6771, ruling step 1).
 *
 * Two things are pinned here, and they fail for different reasons:
 *
 * 1. **The instrument.** Every assertion in the first block corresponds to a
 *    bug the first draft of the census actually had, and each one failed the
 *    same way: it returned a SILENT ZERO with exit 0. A census that reads zero
 *    because it is blind is indistinguishable from a corpus that is clean —
 *    which is the exact failure mode the card's own history is made of.
 *
 * 2. **The population.** The `body`-only key list is read back off the renderer
 *    sources, so it cannot go stale the way the card body's "10" did. If
 *    someone teaches `badge` to read `children`, or adds a `sidebar-*`
 *    registration, this goes red rather than the census quietly measuring the
 *    wrong set.
