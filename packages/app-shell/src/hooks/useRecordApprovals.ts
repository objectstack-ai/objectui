/**
 * useRecordApprovals
 *
 * Resolves the approval state for a single record — the READ half only: the
 * status badge, the record lock (`lock_record`), and the request rows the
 * record page's approvals panel renders.
 *
 * Since ADR-0019 an approval is a **flow node** (`type: 'approval'`), not a
 * standalone process: the flow opens the request when it reaches the node,
 * and a decision resumes the run down its `approve` / `reject` edge.
 *
 * ⛔ This hook does NOT decide (objectui#3055). It used to own a second,
 * hand-written decision path — an `approve()` / `reject()` pair plus a
 * CLIENT-side `canDecide` (`pending_approvers.includes(currentUserId)`) — that
 * the record page injected as two hard-coded header buttons. That fork covered
 * two of the nine approval routes: reassign / send-back / request-info had zero
 * entry point on a business record, decision attachments were impossible, and
 * the copy was maintained separately from the approvals list's. Decisions now
 * go through the SAME server-declared `sys_approval_request` actions the
 * approvals list runs (`DeclaredActionsBar`), gated by the server-computed
 * `viewer` block rather than by a second client-side opinion — so a new
 * decision action is metadata, not console code.
 *
 * Talks directly to the framework REST endpoints under
 * `/api/v1/approvals/*`. Fails open: if the approvals plugin is not installed
 * (404 / 501) or the user has no identity, returns inert state so the detail
 * view continues to render normally.
