/**
 * Derive a context-aware empty-state config for object lists whose
 * `managedBy` bucket means the user can't create rows directly from
 * this list view.
 *
 * Background: previously the entire affordance story was carried by a
 * full-width banner pinned to the top of every list/detail/form page.
 * That violated the principle most enterprise platforms (Salesforce,
 * ServiceNow, SAP Fiori, Notion, Linear) settled on long ago: hide the
 * affordance you don't want users to take, and use the *empty state* as
 * the only place to explain why the list is empty and where new entries
 * come from.
 *
 * This helper returns an `emptyState` payload compatible with the
 * `ListView` schema (`{ title, message, icon }`). It only fires for the
 * buckets where the default empty state ("No records yet") would be
 * misleading; for `platform`/`config` it returns `undefined` so the
 * caller falls back to the user-defined view-level empty state.
 *
 * The bucket → message mapping mirrors `ManagedByBadge` so that the badge
 * (in the header) and the empty state (in the body) tell a consistent
 * story without repeating themselves verbatim.
