/**
 * REACHABILITY MEASUREMENT for objectui#8725 — a `{ group }` form section and
 * `SchemaForm`'s three unguarded `s.fields` reads.
 *
 * ⚠️ This file records a DEFECT that is still open. Its runtime pins assert what
 * this renderer does TODAY, which is to die. They are a measurement, not an
 * endorsement: whoever rules on the disposition (see "What is NOT decided here")
 * is expected to turn them into pins on the chosen behaviour, and their going
 * red is the intended signal that the ruling landed.
 *
 * ## Why the measurement was needed
 *
 * objectui#8725 was filed with reachability explicitly NOT measured, and named
 * that as its own gap: "a defect established only by reading is the thing this
 * queue has been wrong about before". The card guessed the inputs were "this
 * repo's own `*.form.ts` create/edit schemas, which do not author `group`",
 * which would have made the defect latent.
 *
 * That guess is FALSE, in a way that matters. This repository contains no
 * `*.form.ts` file at all. The `form` document `SchemaForm` renders arrives on
 * two channels, and the wider of the two is a SERVER document:
 *
 *   • `RichMetadataTypeEntry.form` (`useMetadata.ts`) is `Record<string,
 *     unknown>` — the `/meta/types` registry response, deserialised with no
 *     validation and no normalisation (`useMetadataTypes` casts the payload) —
 *     and `ResourceEditPage.tsx` hands it to this component as
 *     `form={... (entry?.form as any)}`. `EmbeddedItemEditor.tsx` does the same
 *     with `subEntry?.form as any`.
 *   • the spec-bundled forms (`getPageForm` / `getViewForm` / `getReportForm` /
 *     `getDashboardForm`), which read `pageForm` & co. straight out of
 *     `@objectstack/spec/ui` — an upstream, versioned document this repo does
 *     not author either. Measured against the installed artifact (17.4.0), none
 *     of those four declares a `group` section today; that is a property of one
 *     spec release, not a barrier.
 *
 * So the REQUIRED `fields` on {@link FormSectionSpec} stands between a
 * TypeScript author and this renderer, and between nothing else. A section
 * carrying `group` and no `fields` — which `FormSectionSchema` ACCEPTS, measured
 * against the installed artifact (17.4.0) — reaches the reads unimpeded.
 *
 * ## What was measured, and how the card's wording is one word off
 *
 * The card names three read sites and predicts `Cannot read properties of
 * undefined (reading 'map')`. That is the diagnostic of the SECOND and THIRD
 * sites. It is not what fires. `SchemaFormBody`'s own pre-flight loop is above
 * both of them in the same render, and it is a `for…of`, so the throw is a
 * TypeError naming iteration, not `.map` — see {@link readSiteThatFiresFirst}.
 * The distinction is load-bearing for whoever fixes this: guarding only the two
 * `.map` sites the card quotes leaves the crash exactly where it is.
 *
 * ## What is NOT decided here (objectui#8725's own framing)
 *
 * Neither half of the fix is in this file. Widening `FormSectionSpec.fields` to
 * optional ALONE removes the compile-time barrier above without deciding what
 * the reads do, which converts a `tsc` error into this same runtime death on a
 * second channel; and choosing what a group-referencing section renders is a
 * behaviour ruling on a renderer (`?? []` degrades it to an EMPTY section —
 * today's silent drop made non-throwing) or an import of
 * `resolveSectionGroupReferences` from `@object-ui/plugin-form`, which needs an
 * object definition this component is not handed. ⛔ And no assembly rule may be
 * re-implemented on the objectui side (objectui#7051, objectstack#13855).
 *
 * ## One thing the card could not know, measured here
 *
 * The trap the card names — "widening the type alone removes the compile-time
 * barrier" — is real but LOUD, not silent. Measured by widening
 * `FormSectionSpec.fields` to optional against this package's `type-check`:
 * `strictNullChecks` immediately reports `TS18048: 's.fields' is possibly
 * 'undefined'` at all three read sites (`SchemaForm.tsx` 786 / 1030 / 1147),
 * plus collateral at `form-spec.containers.test.tsx` PIN D (whose
 * `FormSectionSpec['fields'][number]` then needs a `NonNullable`) and four
 * sites in `mergeServerFields.test.ts`. So part 1 cannot ship without an author
 * confronting every read. What the compiler cannot do is stop them from typing
 * `?? []` to silence it — which is the behaviour ruling this card is holding
 * open, and the reason this file stops here.
