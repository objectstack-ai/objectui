/**
 * `ConditionBuilder`'s raw CEL editor must ADVERTISE the roots its mount site
 * binds — objectui#9645, the sibling half of objectui#8167.
 *
 * ## The defect these cases reproduce
 *
 * objectui#8167 made the editor LINT in the mount's scope. It did not make the
 * autocomplete agree: the mount forwarded no `roots` override, so it offered
 * whatever `introspectScope` advertises for that scope — every root ANY
 * predicate site may see. A hook `condition` is evaluated by objectstack's
 * hook wrapper against `{ record: record ?? {}, previous }`, and an
 * unevaluable condition throws `HookConditionError` rather than resolving
 * false (objectstack#4775, fail-LOUD on purpose). So the editor offered
 * `os.user.id`, the lint endorsed it — the accept set is the engine's
 * `SCOPE_ROOTS`, which carries `os` / `current_user` / `vars` at this scope —
 * and the author's write paid for it at runtime.
 *
 * ## Real engine, on purpose
 *
 * Like `ConditionBuilder.mountScope.test.tsx`, and for the same reason: the
 * question under test is what the ENGINE was asked and what the editor did
 * with the answer. A stub would let the suite stay green while the production
 * path asked for the whole default list.
 *
 * ## The pins are DERIVED, not retyped
 *
 * The advertised list is compared against `introspectCelScope`'s own answer
 * rather than against a copy of it, so the reading fails when either side
 * moves: a root added to {@link RECORD_CONDITION_ROOTS} that the engine does
 * not accept, or an engine that grows a root at this scope which nobody has
 * yet decided is bound here.
 *
 * ## The conflation this file also fences
 *
 * `ConditionBuilder` carries a SECOND roots concept, {@link REFERENCE_ROOTS} —
 * the roots a value typed into the VALUE BOX may plainly reference instead of
 * being quoted as literal text. The two populations overlap and do not
 * coincide: the value-box list carries roots the engine's record scope does
 * not advertise at all. A case below states that in the engine's own terms, so
 * merging the two lists reddens here rather than quietly re-advertising roots
 * nothing binds.
