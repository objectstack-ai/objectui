 * objectui#8072 — `InputSchema.wrapperClass`, the last `schema.wrapperClass`
 * reader whose value was admitted unexamined.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `packages/components/src/renderers/form/input.tsx` reads
 * `cn("grid w-full items-center gap-1.5", schema.wrapperClass)` — classes on
 * the wrapper `div` around the input and its label. The TypeScript face
 * declared the key (`../form.ts`, docblock "Input wrapper CSS class"); the zod
 * mirror never did, so the value parsed through `.passthrough()` and
 * `{ type: 'input', wrapperClass: 42 }` validated GREEN. The same document on
 * any of the eight sibling readers — `checkbox`, `file-upload`,
 * `filter-builder` (objectui#6150 / #6938), `switch`, `textarea`,
 * `date-picker`, `select`, `list` (objectui#7722) — was already refused at the
 * key. That asymmetry, not the missing declaration, is what this file pins.
 *
 * The gap was a RECORDED row of the parity ledger
 * (`UnmirroredDeclared['form.zod.ts#InputSchema']` in
 * `zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`), so closing it moves that file's census figures
 * and retires the self-expiring exemption
 * `wrapper-class-declared-7722.test.ts` carried for this one reader.
 *
 * ## The assertion that matters, and its three controls
 *
 * ⭐ The verdict under test is NOT "the key is declared" — under
 * `.passthrough()` a parse that accepts proves nothing about membership. It is
 * that `{ type: 'input', wrapperClass: 42 }` moved from ACCEPTED to REFUSED,
 * and each control keeps that reading from being something else:
 *
 *   - **The authored string still parses**, on both faces and through the
 *     published union entry point — otherwise the measurement would be of a
 *     broken schema rather than of a closed gap.
 *   - **A SIBLING refuses the same wrong-typed document**, and refused it
 *     before this change too: this diff touches no mirror but `InputSchema`,
 *     so the `checkbox` leg reads the same on either side of it. That is what
 *     makes `input` the outlier rather than this file the instrument.
 *   - **An UNDECLARED key still admits any value unexamined**, so the mirror's
 *     unknown-key policy is byte-for-byte what it was and exactly one key
 *     moved.
 *
 * ## The strict authoring twin moves in the OPPOSITE direction, deliberately
 *
 * `StrictAnyComponentSchema` (objectui#8345) is DERIVED from these mirrors and
 * closes unknown keys, so before this change it refused an authored
 * `wrapperClass` on `input` outright — a key the published TypeScript face
 * invites. Declaring it narrows the tolerant face and, in the same move, lets
 * the strict face accept what the TS declaration always promised. Both legs
 * are pinned below because the two faces move apart, not together.
