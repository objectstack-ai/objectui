/**
 * The rule for a PREDICATE GATE key (`visible` / `disabled`) — objectui#6505.
 *
 * ## What this rule used to say, and what it cost
 *
 * Both keys read `typeof value === 'boolean'`, message `"<key> must be a
 * boolean"`. Both keys are EXPRESSIONS everywhere else in the system: AGENTS.md
 * §4 declares the protocol as `hidden?: string; // expression` /
 * `disabled?: string; // expression`, `SchemaRenderer` evaluates them through
 * `hasDeclaredPredicate` + `evaluateCondition`, `@objectstack/spec` normalizes
 * every authored predicate into a `{ dialect, source }` envelope, and the
 * objectui#3862 / objectui#3955 rulings are entirely about which EXPRESSION
 * spellings count as declared. So the node the docs teach —
 * `{ type: 'button', disabled: "${record.stage == 'closed'}" }` — was reported
 * `disabled must be a boolean` by the dev-mode validator and its host element
 * got `data-obj-schema-invalid`, the cue apps hang a red outline off.
 *
 * `BASE_SCHEMA_RULES` was the ONE place in the repo that disagreed with the
 * protocol, so this restores declared = enforced rather than widening a
 * contract: the accept set moves to exactly what the runtime already accepts.
 *
 * ## Why `hasDeclaredPredicate` and not a check written here
 *
 * `evaluator/declaredPredicate.ts` is the repo's single definition of "is a
 * predicate gate DECLARED on this value?" (objectui#3850's ruling; nothing in
 * the repo asks that question anywhere else). A second, hand-rolled answer in
 * this table is how the validator and the renderer come to disagree about the
 * same value — which is the defect class this rule was already an instance of.
 * The delegation is behavioural, so it is pinned behaviourally: the drift pin in
 * `__tests__/predicate-valued-gate-rules.test.ts` asserts this rule's verdict
 * equals `boolean || hasDeclaredPredicate(value)` across every probe.
 *
 * ## Why the boolean arm survives even though it is subsumed
 *
 * `hasDeclaredPredicate(true)` and `hasDeclaredPredicate(false)` are both
 * `true` today (`toPredicateInput` returns a boolean unchanged), so the first
 * arm changes no verdict. It is kept because it makes this rule's accept set a
 * provable SUPERSET of the one it replaces, locally: a future narrowing on the
 * declaredness side cannot silently start reporting `disabled: false` — the
 * most explicit gate an author can write — as an invalid schema.
 *
 * ## What it still REFUSES (the half that is not negotiable)
 *
 * Everything `hasDeclaredPredicate` calls junk: a number, `null`, `{}`, an
 * array, `''`, whitespace-only predicate text, and the empty / blank-`source`
 * envelope (objectui#3960). Every one of those was refused before this change
 * too — the accept set widens and nothing refused becomes accepted. Dropping
 * the two keys from this table was the option this fix was explicitly forbidden
 * to take: an absent rule reports nothing at all, which is gate weakening
 * wearing the same green.

 *
 * ## What this refuses, and why it is an error rather than a warning
 *
 * Measured on `main` at f2e11ae6f, the real `form` renderer on the built-in
 * path (no `registerAllFields()`):
 *
 *   type            registry hit   rendered type
 *   ui:password     TRUE           text
 *   secret          false          text
 *   field:secret    false          text
 *
 * `ui:password` **is** registered — as an SDUI node renderer for a top-level
 * `{ type: 'email' }`-style node — so an author who checks whether it resolves
 * gets a YES, and still gets a clear-text box on the field path. That is the
 * shape where verifying does not protect you, and it is why the class, not
 * another entry in a renderer-side table, is what gets closed here: the table
 * fix answers today's spellings and leaves the next invented id to find the
 * same silent degrade. AI-authored metadata invents plausible-looking widget
 * ids constantly; this makes inventing one an ERROR at authoring time instead
 * of a text box that looks like it worked.
 *
 * A warning was explicitly ruled out — a warning IS the silent degrade this
 * check exists to kill, in a new spelling.
 *
 * ## Why only the NAMESPACED spelling
 *
 * `field:` is allowed whether or not the widget is registered: registration is
 * a RUNTIME fact (`registerAllFields()`, a lazily loaded plugin) that an
 * authoring-time validator cannot see, and the renderer already answers an
 * unregistered `field:` secret with a visible refusal (objectui#5322). A BARE
 * name is likewise allowed: it is an open set — every registered `field:<name>`
 * widget, third-party ones included, is reachable by its short name.
 *
 * What is decidable statically is the namespace, and it is a CLOSED set of one.
 * Any other `<ns>:<name>` resolves nothing on the field path by the #5254
 * ruling and falls to the renderer's plain-text `default` arm.
 *
 * ## Census (the ruling made arming this conditional on one)
 *
 * 4,397 authored files in this repo, 649 form-field `type`/`widget` literals,
 * 98 structurally parsed form-field entries in `examples/schema-catalog`:
 * SEVEN colon-qualified ids on the form-field path, five of them `field:*`.
 * The two remaining occurrences are one source line naming `ref:component`,
 * which is a metadata-admin designer `SchemaForm` widget resolved by its own
 * `WIDGETS` table — a different shape (`{ field, widget }` under
 * `sections[].fields[]`, node type `simple`) that this function, gated on
 * `type === 'form'`, never reaches. Zero occurrences of `ui:password`,
 * `secret` or `field:secret` anywhere on the field path.
