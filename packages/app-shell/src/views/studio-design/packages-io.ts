/**
 * Package-list helpers shared by the Studio package switcher and the builder
 * landing page.
 *
 * Writability is the SERVER's verdict, not a shape we derive. Every row of
 * `GET /api/v1/packages` carries a top-level `writable: boolean` computed by
 * `isWritablePackage` (ADR-0070 D2, objectstack#14375) — the same predicate the
 * server's authoring (`saveMetaItem`) and lifecycle (`DELETE` / `disable`) gates
 * enforce, so the badge and the gate cannot disagree. Read it; do not re-derive
 * it.
 *
 * The `scope !== 'project'` expression below is ONLY the fallback for servers
 * that predate that field, and it is WRONG for one row: a `type: module`
 * sub-package of a multi-package artifact (ADR-0130 D4) normally omits `scope`
 * — the schema default is applied at PARSE time, while the artifact load path
 * deliberately hands the RAW manifest body to `registerApp`, so the served row
 * has no `scope` key at all. The heuristic reads that as a writable database
 * base, yet the server refuses every write to it (it is in `engine.manifests`).
 * Nothing in the raw row separates it from a scope-less Studio-created base,
 * which really is writable — only the server's `engine.manifests` does, which is
 * why the client cannot compute this and a "missing scope means read-only" rule
 * would have flipped every Studio base read-only.
 *
 * Kernel packages (scope `system` / `cloud`) are hidden here whatever their
 * verdict says: that filter is about visibility, not writability.

 * That is not an inference: the server's own list handler reads

 * registry-shaped entry lost its human name and the Studio top bar showed the
 * reverse-domain package id (`app.b2r4`) where the author expected the app's
 * name (objectui#7254). Closing the asymmetry inside the one reader that
 * already declares both positions — not a new tolerant dialect.

/**

 *
 * It was `if (!res.ok) throw new Error(\`HTTP ${res.status}\`)`: the body was
 * never opened at all, so `message`, `code` and `userMessage` were dropped
 * together and the status became the entire report. Every caller here reports
 * through `formatMetadataError`, which renders `err.message` — so a 403 whose
 * envelope said `Reading packages requires the \`studio.access\` or
 * \`setup.access\` capability.` reached the author as the four characters
 * `HTTP 403`, and the one sentence that named the capability to grant was
 * discarded by the reader that was holding it.
 *
 * This is a strictly larger loss than the sibling `fetchFullPackage` lookup's
 * (objectui#7938), which at least read `message` and `code`. Both now read the
 * same envelope by the same rule — see {@link readEnvelopeFailureText} for the
 * rule and for why the mark outranks the diagnostic at every status.
 *
 * ⛔ The fallback stays `HTTP <status>`, unchanged and deliberately so: it is
 * what a body-less or unparseable failure (a proxy's HTML 502) still says, and
 * `StudioDesignSurface.packageListErrorPosture` / `manageSnapshotRefresh` pin
 * that the three-state switcher and the refresh report keep working when the
 * wire answers with nothing readable.
