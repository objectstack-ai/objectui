/**
 * Home stops offering the metadata-authoring front door on a deployment whose
 * own runtime config says authoring is not offered here (objectui#5521).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * On the composed hosted-SaaS shape (`OS_TENANCY_POSTURE=isolated`), Home led a
 * plain tenant with "Build an app — start from scratch, design objects, forms,
 * automations and interfaces". Behind it: `/api/v1/meta/*` → 403 and a
 * ToolRegistry holding zero authoring handlers. The lockdown criterion for that
 * shape is two-part — UI entry hidden AND API refused — and only the backend
 * half was green.
 *
 * `features.aiStudio` is the server's own answer to "is AI-driven metadata
 * authoring offered by this runtime". It was *wrong* on this shape until
 * cloud#1471 derived it from the same resolution that decides the agent mount;
 * before that it leaked a default `true` and honouring it here would have
 * hidden nothing. It is truthful now, and this page did not read it.
 *
 * ## Why HIDDEN rather than dimmed
 *
 * The flag's declared meaning, on both sides of the wire, is *hide*:
 * `RuntimeFeatures.aiStudio` documents "when false, the SPA hides the AI
 * authoring affordances", and the serving plugin documents "set false to
 * force-hide the authoring UI". The sibling `features.marketplace` means
 * something different — reachability of a route — which is why objectui#5504
 * correctly rendered *it* as a dimmed card plus a visible reason. Two flags,
 * two declared meanings, two presentations.
 *
 * ## Why these cases drive the REAL runtime-config module
 *
 * Verbatim from `HomePage.marketplaceDisabled.test.tsx`: the claim under test is
 * that the gate consumes the SERVER's `features.aiStudio`, so every case boots
 * the genuine `initRuntimeConfig()` over a stubbed `GET /api/v1/runtime/config`
 * rather than mocking an accessor. Mocking the accessor would pass against a
 * page that never asks the server anything.
 *
 * ## Why `t` returns «key»
 *
 * The reason lines must resolve THROUGH i18n. Verbatim from
 * `HomePage.authoringCapabilityGate.test.tsx`, which states the argument in full.
 *
 * ## Guarding the vacuum
 *
 * The acceptance condition is that something does NOT render, which an empty
 * page reproduces perfectly. So every denial case also asserts the furniture it
 * is denying *around* — the app tile the strip renders and the sibling template
 * cover — and the counter-probes drive the SAME fixture through the SAME helper
 * with the flag flipped and find the card. An empty render fails the denials'
 * counter-assertions; a gate stuck open fails the denials; a gate that swept the
 * whole cover fails the sibling assertion. None of the three can pass alone.

/* ── The HomePage fetch router (objectui#8033) ────────────────────────────────
 * These cases boot the REAL `initRuntimeConfig()`, so the global `fetch` has to
 * answer `GET /api/v1/runtime/config`. It used to answer with a blanket SINK:
 * one `vi.fn` handing the runtime-config body back for EVERY url. Two things
 * were wrong with that.
 *
 * `HomePage` reaches more than one endpoint. Besides the config read, every
 * render mounts `PendingDraftsBanner`, whose `usePendingDrafts({})` fetches
 * `GET /api/v1/meta/_drafts` with the GLOBAL `fetch` — `usePendingDrafts.ts:48`,
 * no `apiFetch` seam anywhere on the path — from its mount effect
 * (`usePendingDrafts.ts:116` via `refresh` at `:90`). The sink handed THAT reader
 * the runtime-config body; it found no `drafts` key and yielded `[]`, so nothing
 * failed. And nothing could: a sink keeps no record of what it was handed and
 * asserts nothing about what it served, so a future new escape from `HomePage`
 * would be answered silently instead of going red.
 *
 * So the double is a RECORDING ROUTER — the shape objectui#5225 settled on,
 * carried by `packages/plugin-report/src/__tests__/DatasetReportRenderer.test.tsx`
 * and installed by objectui#7307's batches in the four sibling files in this
 * directory; copied from `HomePage.approvalsTarget.test.tsx` (batch 4, #8032).
 * It serves exactly the two routes these renders reach, records every url it is
 * handed, and `afterEach` fails on any url outside that set. This file is NOT on
 * the network-escape burn-down list — that list reached zero and was retired, and
 * no gate covers these two routes here — so that assertion is the file's own
 * evidence rather than a duplicate of one.
 *
 * `_drafts` answers a known-EMPTY ledger in the `{ drafts: [...] }` envelope
 * `fetchPendingDrafts` reads. Empty rather than seeded is load-bearing:
 * `PendingDraftsBanner` renders `null` for both `count === null` (what the sink's
 * unparseable answer produced) and `count === 0`, so no assertion in this file
 * moves. Routes are matched on the PATHNAME because the hook appends a
 * `?packageId=` scope for package-bound callers; the full url is what is recorded.
