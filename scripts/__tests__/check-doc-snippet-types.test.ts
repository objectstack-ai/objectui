/**
 * objectui#5138 shape 2 — the test for `scripts/check-doc-snippet-types.mjs`.
 *
 * The gate compiles documentation snippets against the BUILT types. Its three
 * self-controls (resolution / sentinel / positive) can only be exercised against
 * a real build, which this suite deliberately does not do — a unit test that
 * needed `turbo run build` would stop running per-PR. So what is pinned here is
 * everything that can go wrong WITHOUT a build, in the order it would hurt:
 *
 *  1. **The fragment rule**, because its failure mode is silent. A marker that
 *     attaches to the wrong block, or a block that gets skipped without a
 *     declaration, converts a real defect into a green.
 *  2. **The ledger is re-derived, never trusted** — an entry for a file that no
 *     longer exists, or that holds no snippet, is a hole that reads as coverage.
 *  3. **The scan cannot collapse quietly.** An empty walk makes every other
 *     assertion vacuous, which is how a gate reports green over nothing.
 *  4. **The types come from `dist`, never from `src`.** The repository's own root
 *     `tsconfig.json` maps the workspace to source; a harness that inherited it
 *     would check the docs against code no consumer sees.
 *  5. **The gate is wired**, in a workflow a docs-only pull request can start.
 *  6. **Third-party resolution reaches exactly as far as the imported packages
 *     DECLARE** (objectui#6120), in either of the two fields the map reads —
 *     `dependencies`, and the REQUIRED `peerDependencies` this workspace
 *     resolves (objectui#8919). This one's failure mode is the worst in the list
 *     because it is invisible: widen resolution past the declarations and every
 *     document stays green while the gate stops being able to fail. The suite
 *     therefore pins every direction — a declared dependency IS mapped, a
 *     required peer IS mapped, an OPTIONAL peer and a devDependency are NOT, an
 *     installed-but-undeclared one is NOT — plus the two preconditions the
 *     UNDECLARED control needs in order to mean anything. The peer half is
 *     pinned as an ADDITION: `dependencies` still decides every specifier it
 *     names, first, from its own owner's directory.
 *  7. **The exit path tells "I could not run" from "I ran and found errors"**
 *     (objectui#5465). A run that resolved against nothing produced no verdict
 *     about any document; leaving through the same code as a real snippet
 *     failure makes neither actionable, and leaving through 0 would be zero
 *     information wearing a green tick.
 *
 * Fixtures are throwaway trees, never `content/docs`: a committed fixture page
 * would have to contain a deliberately broken snippet, and this very gate scans
 * that directory.

 *
 * objectui#5174's last batch paid the debt down: the page's five ts/tsx blocks
 * compile against the built `dist/*.d.ts`, so the row came off and the ledger
 * reached ZERO. The assertion therefore pins the far end of that walk — NOT on

/**
 * objectui#7856 card 2 — the two subtrees BELOW that top level, and the one
 * widening in this family whose whole delivery is the LEDGER.
 *
 * The sibling rule this file's header states — "Widening a scan surface is the
 * change that can be GREEN ABOUT NOTHING… Anything added here later is owed the
 * same proof" — lands differently here than it did for card 1, and the difference
 * is the reason this block exists rather than a copy of the one above it.
 *
 * Card 1 could prove its widening by showing the leg's blocks in the COMPILED
 * tier: its eleven diagnostics were repaired, so the pages are judged on every
 * commit. Card 2 may not make that claim and must not fake it. `docs/adr/**` and
 * `docs/audits/**` are RECORDS — an ADR states what was decided on a date, an
 * audit states what was true on a date — and the 2026-09-07 triage ruling on
 * objectui#7856 drew the line for both: "Repairing a code block inside one
 * falsifies the record, exactly as it would inside an ADR." ⇒ Every block-bearing
 * page in these two legs is on `UNGATED_DOCS`, which means NOTHING in them is
 * compiled.
 *
 * So the proof this block owes is the opposite shape, and it is a stricter one:
 *
 *   1. the pages really are in the walk (membership, by name, from the legs
 *      themselves — the objectui#5174 distinction between a NAMED debt and a tree
 *      no accounting can mention);
 *   2. every one of them that holds a `ts` / `tsx` block really is on the ledger,
 *      because a page in the walk, off the ledger and silently compiling nothing
 *      is the counterfeit;
 *   3. NOTHING from either leg reaches the compiled tier — stated as an assertion
 *      rather than left as an inference, so the day one of them is repaired this
 *      test is what asks whether the record survived it;
 *   4. each ledger entry carries a MEASURED count and names the record, so
 *      "declared" cannot decay into an adjective;
 *   5. no `FRAGMENT_MARKER` was written inside either subtree. That is card 2's
 *      most easily lost decision: a marker is an edit INSIDE a record, and an
 *      ungated document is never compiled, so a marker there would declare a block
 *      this gate already does not read — debt with nothing to ever prompt its
 *      removal. The ledger alone already keeps the block accounted for.
 *
 * The BOUNDARY is pinned the same way card 1's was, with one addition: `recursive:
 * true` on these two against `recursive: false` on `ROOT_DOCS` is a claim about
 * three different walks, so the fixture below shows the descent happening here and
 * the test above shows it not happening there. A subdirectory of `docs/` that is
 * neither of these two is in no leg at all, and that is asserted rather than
 * assumed.

/**
 * objectui#7308 — every `README.md` under `packages/`, at any depth, ledger-first.
 *
 * The defect this closes was a SPECIFICATION defect rather than drift: the
 * header's SCAN SURFACE paragraph said `every packages/<name>/README.md`, one
 * level, literally, and `listDocuments` implemented that sentence faithfully. So
 * four nested pages were neither compiled nor ledgered — objectui#5174's "neither
 * covered NOR declared ungated", one directory down — and `check-doc-links` had
 * already closed the identical hole on the identical four files (objectui#6026).
 *
 * The proof this block owes is card 2's shape rather than card 1's, because this
 * widening also lands LEDGER-FIRST: three of the four pages carry blocks that do
 * not compile today, so showing them in the compiled tier is a claim this card
 * may not make. What it asserts instead:
 *
 *   1. the pages are really in the walk, and the walk is EXACTLY the tracked
 *      population under `packages/` — measured against `git ls-files` rather than
 *      a hand-written list, which is the only version of this assertion that
 *      notices a fifth page landing tomorrow;
 *   2. every one of them that holds a `ts` / `tsx` block is on the ledger, and
 *      every one that holds none is COVERED and ledgered nowhere — the second
 *      half is not decoration, it is why this card writes THREE rows for FOUR
 *      pages, and it is the mechanical refutation of "keep the ledger short by
 *      leaving the page outside the surface";
 *   3. the leg cannot double-collect a package's own top-level `README.md`, which
 *      objectui#6026 got structurally by rooting the walk one directory down;
 *   4. ⚠️ the walk does not follow pnpm's workspace symlinks out of the authored
 *      tree. This is the one hazard no other leg in this file has: every other
 *      recursive walk here crosses an authored tree with nothing generated inside
 *      it, while `packages/` has a `node_modules/` per package whose entries are
 *      SYMLINKS to sibling workspace packages — and `statSync` follows symlinks,
 *      so `packages/a/node_modules/@object-ui/b` leads back into `packages/b` and
 *      onward forever. Measured on `9ba7e9c3` with the workspace installed: an
 *      unguarded walk does not merely overshoot, it does not terminate; capped at
 *      depth 12 it had already reached 17,354 files named `README.md` against the
 *      43 the repository tracks. The fixture below reproduces that cycle in
 *      miniature, so the guard is asserted rather than trusted.
 *
 * ⛔ What is deliberately NOT asserted: a `main()` refusal when `packages/` is
 * missing, of the kind `ROOT_DOCS` and the two subtree legs carry. This leg walks
 * the SAME directory the top-level package-README leg has always walked, and that
 * leg has never had one — introducing a new precondition on the shared directory
 * is a different change from widening the depth this one reads. The vacuity floor
 * that does apply is this file's own "scans a plausible number of documents".
