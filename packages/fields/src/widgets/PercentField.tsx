   * Decimal places come from `scale`, NOT `precision` (objectui#9568) — the
   * correction `NumberField` in this directory already carries, and the one
   * objectui#9295 made on the read-only cell, the grid summary footer and the
   * detail summary chip. This widget is the face that did not move.
   *
   * `@objectstack/spec` declares the pair on the field face in its own words:
   * `precision` is "Total digits (non-negative integer)" and `scale` is
   * "Decimal places (non-negative integer)". Reading `precision` padded every
   * value out to the column's TOTAL width, so a decimal(10, 2) percent field
   * rendered `25.0000000000%` and offered a `1e-10` step — a step that is not
   * a cosmetic defect but an unusable control for the value it is declared to
   * edit.
   *
   * ⛔ NOT `CurrencyConfigSchema.precision`, which is a different surface with
   * the opposite convention and its own `scale` alias; the spec warns against
   * conflating the two at the field-face declaration itself. And ⛔ not
   * `CurrencyField`'s read of `precision` either: there the competing source is
   * the currency's own ISO 4217 minor-unit count, and objectui#4361 ruled an
   * authored `precision` wins over THAT. It ruled nothing about `scale`, which
   * a currency field's face does not carry a meaning for, and it pushed the
   * contract question upstream rather than settling it here.
   *
   * `typeof`, not truthiness: `scale: 0` is a valid declaration (a percent
   * field that edits whole percents) and `||` would silently drop it — the
   * reason `NumberField` guards its own read the same way, and the guard the
   * `max` read below already uses. `??` would keep a `0` too, but it also
   * keeps a `scale: "2"` arriving from JSON metadata, and inventing a width
   * from a string is the consumer-side guessing AGENTS.md #0.1 refuses.
   *
   * An ABSENT `scale` keeps this widget's own 2. The repair moves the MEMBER
   * that is read and nothing else, so it is invisible to every percent field
   * that declares neither member. ⚠️ Stated rather than papered over: that
   * leaves this widget and `PercentCellRenderer` still disagreeing when
   * nothing is declared — the cell spells the same absence `0` and pins it —
   * which is a disagreement objectui#9568 explicitly declines to make a
   * premise and this change neither widens nor closes. Whether the two faces
   * should agree at all needs its own ruling, not a side effect of this one.

   * The bare `parseFloat` below has no whole-string guard of its own, and that
   * is deliberate rather than objectui#6715's defect repeated. This is a
   * `type="number"` input, and a real browser never exposes non-numeric
   * residue through `.value` — keystrokes and pastes are filtered before the
   * change event fires.
   *
   * Measured on Chromium 141.0.7390.37 (Playwright 1.62.1), driving THIS
   * widget (fraction convention, a two-decimal width):
   *
   * ```
   * typed  "12abc" -> box.value "12"    onChange(0.12)
   * typed  "1.2.3" -> box.value "1.23"  onChange(0.0123)
   * pasted "0x10"  -> box.value "010"   onChange(0.1)
   * typed  "1e"    -> box.value ""      onChange(null)   validity.badInput
   * ```
   *
   * ⛔ objectui#6715's anchored `WHOLE_NUMBER_TEXT` is deliberately NOT copied
   * here: it accepts every string this box can produce and rejects only
   * strings the TEST environment fabricates, because happy-dom does not
   * implement the sanitization. See the fuller note in `CurrencyField.tsx`,
   * and the pinned oracle-vs-product table in
   * `__tests__/NumberInputWidgets.environmentDivergence.test.tsx`.
   *
   * ⭐ CLOSED for the last row (objectui#6780, ruled 2026-08-29): the silent
   * drop is ANNOUNCED, via the platform's own `validity.badInput`, across all
   * four `type="number"` widgets of this package as one change. The measurement
   * and the reason the EMISSION is unchanged live in `numberBadInput.tsx`.
   *
   * ⛔ STILL SILENT, deliberately: the TRUNCATING rows above (`1.2.3` stores
   * `0.0123`, `0x10` stores `0.1`). The browser filtered those keystrokes
   * before this handler ran, so no widget-side guard can refuse them. Written
   * down for users in `content/docs/guide/fields.md`, because a control that
   * warns about `1e` while silently truncating `1.2.3` teaches people that no
   * warning means the value is right.
