/**
 * Turning a metadata read-warning (objectui#7741) into the message the user
 * reads.
 *
 * Lives apart from `AdapterProvider` — and, deliberately, imports NOTHING that
 * renders — so the wording and the reason-branching can be exercised directly.
 * Same split, and the same reason, as its siblings `writeWarningToast.ts` and
 * `saveAdvisoryToast.ts`: the caller owns the sink, the test hands over its
 * own, and no module mock is needed.
 *
 * ## Why this surface has to exist at all
 *
 * `listImportMappings` degrades every failure to an empty list, and the import
 * wizard hides its saved-mapping selector on an empty list. So a refused or
 * broken door rendered exactly like "no mapping is registered": the feature was
 * simply ABSENT, with a `console.warn` as the only discriminator — in the
 * browser console, with nothing in the UI pointing at it. A user without
 * devtools open could not tell the two apart, and neither could a careful
 * reporter: objectstack#14026 was filed, routed and worked by two seats on that
 * misreading. Promoting the log level would not have changed any of it. This
 * module is the half that makes the failure visible where the decision is made.
 *
 * ## The same surface, a second read (objectui#8151)
 *
 * `listViews` carried the identical swallow, and its cost is the higher one: an
 * empty view list is an object's VIEW SWITCHER, so a user whose token lapsed
 * mid-session was shown an object that appears to have no saved views at all —
 * including views they created. It is the second emitter on this channel, and
 * every string below is chosen by WHICH read failed rather than shared, because
 * a hedged sentence about "a list" would put the ambiguity back in the copy
 * after the event removed it from the data.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT say
 *
 * Nothing about the supported case. The adapter classifies that arm as
 * `not-served` and emits no event at all, so a deployment in a real, supported
 * shape earns no toast — turning one into a visible fault is the failure this
 * surface must not commit. ⚠️ WHICH failures are in that arm is decided per
 * read and is not the same set twice: a server that does not serve the
 * `mapping` kind is quiet, while on `view` only a host with no metadata door at
 * all is (`classifyImportMappingsFailure` / `classifyViewsFailure`).
 *
 * ## Why the server's own words are appended untranslated
 *
 * `code`, `status` and `message` are SERVER data. They are the evidence that
 * separates "could not be read" from "there are none", they are what a user
 * pastes into a bug report, and they go stale the moment the producer rewords
 * them. Only the frame — the title and the remedy sentence — is i18n copy, the
 * same division `saveAdvisoryToast.ts` draws.
 *

/**
 * i18next's `t`, narrowed to what this module uses — RE-EXPORTED from
 * `writeWarningToast`, never re-declared.
 *
 * The rest of this module was modelled on its two siblings, and a fourth copy
 * of their local `export type TranslateFn = …` came along with the pattern.
 * That name already has three declarations (`writeWarningToast`,
 * `saveAdvisoryToast`, `fields/src/widgets/file-size-guard`), and the
 * objectui#6172 甲/A1 ruling is that every exported name has exactly one
 * authority — so a fourth is the one thing this file must not add.
 * `scripts/__tests__/one-authority-per-exported-name-6273.test.ts` caught it,
 * and its remedy is this: `export type { X } from '<the-owner>'` is a
 * re-export, not a second declaration, and the gate does not count it. ⛔ The
 * baseline it also carries is SHRINK-ONLY and is not an option here.
 *
 * Why `writeWarningToast` is the one pointed at, from evidence already in the
 * tree rather than a judgement made here:
 *
 *   - `AdapterProvider` — this module's only caller — already imports
 *     `TranslateFn` from `./writeWarningToast.js` and passes that very value
 *     into all three emitters, including this one. Pointing here is therefore
 *     the wiring that already exists, not a new claim about which file owns
 *     the name.
 *   - `file-size-guard.ts`'s own declaration names
 *     `app-shell/src/providers/writeWarningToast` as "the established
 *     `TranslateFn` pattern" it was copied from.
 *
 * ⛔ This does NOT resolve the pre-existing three-way collision, and is not an
 * attempt to: that predates this card and repairing it belongs to its own.
 * This file's obligation is only to stop adding to it.
