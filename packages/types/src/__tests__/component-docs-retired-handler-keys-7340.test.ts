/**
 * No `content/docs` page teaches a RETIRED handler key as an authorable prop
 * (objectui#7340, the docs half of the objectui#6124 ruling of 2026-08-30).
 *
 * ## Why a pin rather than "the docs gates went green"
 *
 * No gate can see this drift. These pages declare their own illustrative
 * `interface` blocks and prop TABLES (objectui#6143):
 * `check-doc-component-types` reads only the `type` STRING LITERALS out of docs
 * code blocks, and `check-doc-snippet-types` compiles `ts`/`tsx` fences — every
 * fence involved here is `plaintext`, and a markdown table is not a fence at
 * all. So a member row may name any key at all and every gate stays green. Same
 * hole `component-docs-disabled-inherited-7239.test.ts` and
 * `button-group-doc-surface-6347.test.ts` record, one surface over.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins shut
 *
 * objectui#6124 (PR #7339) split the `on*` handler keys in two. 36 keys whose
 * function value actually reaches a renderer keep their function type — a
 * RUNTIME SLOT a React host supplies through props. 22 keys nothing reads
 * became `?: never` tombstones on the TypeScript face and named refusal arms on
 * the zod mirror (`handlerKeyRefusal(key, 'retired', …)`). Doc pages went on
 * listing some of the retired 22 as callable props, teaching a key that is now
 * a `tsc` error to assign and a refusal by name at authoring time.
 *
 * ## Why membership is `(interface, key)` and never the key NAME alone
 *
 * A name-level blacklist would be both wrong and unimplementable here: on this
 * tree `onChange` is RETIRED on 8 schemas and LIVE on 14, `onClick` is RETIRED
 * on 3 and LIVE on 8, `onComplete` is RETIRED on `InputOTPSchema` and LIVE on
 * `BatchOperationConfig`. `input-otp.mdx` is the sharpest case: its `onChange`
 * row is a live runtime slot sitting one line above the retired `onComplete`.
 * The unit of the defect is therefore the pair, resolved against the shipped
 * declaration — which is also what keeps this pin honest in the other
 * direction: un-retiring a key makes the page right and this file's premise
 * wrong, and it goes red pointing at `packages/types` instead of silently
 * going on asserting a removal.
 *
 * ## What this file asserts, and why in this shape
 *
 *   1. CENSUS — the retired population is MEASURED off `packages/types/src`
 *      (`on*?: never` members, anchored, attributed to their enclosing
 *      interface), not hand-listed, and pinned at the count and per-file split
 *      this card measured. #6124 moving its own population must be a decision,
 *      not a silent widening of what this file waves through.
 *   2. PAIR RULE — every doc row whose `(owner, key)` resolves to a retired
 *      shipped member spells `never`. A page may still NAME a tombstone (that
 *      is the "marked retired" disposition the card allows), but it may not
 *      present a callable type for it. Offenders are reported as
 *      `page:line owner.key -> typeText`, so a failure names the row.
 *   3. NAME NET — for the retired keys with NO live declaration anywhere
 *      (`onColumnAdd`, `onCardAdd`, `onSlideChange`, `onSendMessage`,
 *      `onSelectChange`, `onExpandChange`, `onCollapsedChange`, `onConfirm` on
 *      this tree; `onClose` and `onSave` joined with objectui#7344), no row
 *      anywhere spells them callable, whatever owner name
 *      the page used. This is the net for doc-LOCAL interface names, which rule
 *      2 cannot resolve by construction (`plugins/*.mdx` document `Overview` /
 *      `Features` / `Properties` blocks with no shipped counterpart).
 *   4. CONTROL — seven measured runtime-slot rows are present, callable, and
 *      cross-checked against source as NOT `?: never`. This is the
 *      blanket-sweep control: an edit that deleted every `on*` row under
 *      `content/docs` turns these red, and rules 2 and 3 alone would call that
 *      a pass. Four of the seven sit on pages this card edited (`input-otp.mdx`
 *      `onChange`, `schema-reference.md` `onCardMove` / `onCardClick` /
 *      `onQuickAdd`), which is where an over-broad edit would land first.
 *   5. PROSE — the reader flags rows, never mentions. Counter-probes feed it a
 *      sentence naming a retired key and a JSON example key and assert neither
 *      becomes a row, because "the retired `onComplete`" in running prose is
 *      not a teaching row (and pages are free to write one).
 *
 * ## Dispositions, recorded so a later reader does not read them as drift
 *
 * Seven pages had the retired rows REMOVED (the card's preferred disposition;
 * no page's prose depended on one). `basic/button-group.mdx` is the single
 * "marked retired" page, and not by taste: `button-group-doc-surface-6347.test`
 * asserts SET EQUALITY between that page's `ButtonGroupButton` block and the
 * shipped mirror's `.shape`, and `onClick` is still a key of that shape (a
 * refusal arm is a declared member). Removing the row would break that pin's
 * central assertion; spelling it `never` with the node-type pointer satisfies
 * both files. Assertion 6 pins that disposition explicitly so it reads as a
 * decision rather than a page someone forgot.
 *
 * ## Boundary, stated rather than implied
 *
 * The scan covers `content/docs/**` only — the published docs site, which is
 * the authoring surface this card is about. Package `README.md` files are a
 * different population and are not read here (`plugin-chatbot/README.md` shows
 * `onSendMessage` as a REACT PROP on `<ObjectChatbot>`, not as a schema key;
 * that is a different contract and out of this card's scope).
 *
 * ## Predictions, written before the first run (red-first)
 *
 * On the unmodified `origin/main` @ `4704aa4bb` pages, with this file in place:
 *
 *   - rule 2 fails listing exactly 10 rows on 8 pages —
 *     `api/schema-reference.md:926,927` (`KanbanSchema.onColumnAdd`,
 *     `onCardAdd`), `components/basic/button-group.mdx:29`
 *     (`ButtonGroupButton.onClick`), `components/data-display/tree-view.mdx:46,47`
 *     (`TreeViewSchema.onSelectChange`, `onExpandChange`),
 *     `components/form/calendar.mdx:42`, `components/form/combobox.mdx:42`,
 *     `components/form/command.mdx:41`, `components/form/radio-group.mdx:50`
 *     (`.onChange` on each), `components/form/input-otp.mdx:36`
 *     (`InputOTPSchema.onComplete`);
 *   - rule 3 fails listing the 4 of those whose key name is unambiguously
 *     retired (`onColumnAdd`, `onCardAdd`, `onSelectChange`, `onExpandChange`);
 *   - assertion 6 fails, because `button-group.mdx` spells `() => void`;
 *   - the CENSUS, CONTROL and PROSE blocks stay GREEN — the defect is in the
 *     pages' retired rows, and nothing about it touches the runtime-slot rows
 *     or the reader. A run that reddened the control too would mean the reader
 *     is broken, not that the pages are.
