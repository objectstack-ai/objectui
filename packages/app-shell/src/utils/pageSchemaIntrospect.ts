/**
 * Return `root` with every `record:discussion` / `record:chatter` node removed
 * from the containers this module walks.
 *
 * This is the object-level `enable.feeds: false` gate (#2707) applied to a
 * COMPOSED page (objectui#7298). The maintainer ruling of 2026-09-12 makes the
 * declared node the only way a discussion panel reaches a record page, and
 * keeps `enable.feeds` as the object's switch *over* the page: an object with
 * feeds off shows no panel, declared or not. `RecordDetailView` deliberately
 * never fetches `sys_comment` for such an object, so a node left in the tree
 * would render a composer and an empty feed the server would 403 anyway.
 *
 * ⚠️ Identity-preserving on purpose: a subtree with nothing to remove is
 * returned by REFERENCE, so the feeds-ON path (every object that has not opted
 * out) hands the very same object through and nothing downstream sees a new
 * page identity each render.
 *
 * Shared subtrees are walked once and their result reused, so a node that
 * appears twice is pruned in both places; a cycle is left as it stands rather
 * than recursed into.
 *
 * Returns `null` when `root` ITSELF is a discussion node — there is no
 * container to remove it from. Callers pass a page, so this is a total-function
 * corner rather than a case that arises.
