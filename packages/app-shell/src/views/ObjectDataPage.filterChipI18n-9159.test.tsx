/**
 * objectui#9159 round 2 — the is-null filter chip is drawn from the locale
 * packs, like every other user-visible string on this page.
 *
 * The operator landed with its chip text finished inside `groupFilterChips` as
 * the literal `'is null'`. That breaks two rules at once and "make it English"
 * answers only the first: a user-facing literal in a renderer is unlocalized for
 * every reader on every locale, and the defect survives verbatim in whatever
 * language it was written in. So the grouper now hands out the filter builder's
 * existing operator key and this page resolves it at the same half-chip seam
 * that already draws the field name through `fieldLabel`.
 *
 * ## Why this file renders the page instead of asserting the key
 *
 * A test on the grouper's return value can only pin that a key is handed OUT
 * (`drillUrlFilters.test.ts` does that). It stays green if the render site never
 * calls `t` — which is the whole defect, one layer down. So the observation
 * point is the DOM of the real page, under a real `I18nProvider`, and the
 * assertion is on the chip's own text node reached through the remove button
 * beside it rather than on the chip row's whole `textContent`, which also holds
 * the "Filtered by" lead-in and the translated field name.
 *
 * ## Why a NON-English locale, and what each control rules out
 *
 * English cannot tell the two worlds apart: a hardcoded `'is null'` and a
 * correctly resolved `en` pack value render the same pixels. Under `zh` they
 * differ, so the assertion has the power to fail for the reason it exists. The
 * controls below rule out the two ways this could pass vacuously — the packs
 * agreeing (they are asserted to differ, live) and the key failing to resolve
 * (i18next would render the key itself, so the text is asserted not to contain
 * the key's own prefix). ⇒ a pack that loses this key is VISIBLE here rather
 * than silently falling back to English.
