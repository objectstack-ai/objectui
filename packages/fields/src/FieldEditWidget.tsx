 *
 * The host's DOM pass-through set is forwarded WHOLE (objectui#6909). This
 * component's props are `FieldWidgetComponentProps`, so a caller may already
 * pass `id`, `name`, `autoFocus`, `tabIndex`, `onBlur`, `onFocus`, `onClick`,
 * any `aria-*` and any `data-*` with no type error — but the body used to
 * destructure five keys and render the widget with those, so `autoFocus` was
 * the ONLY survivor of the whole block and everything else was silently
 * dropped. That is this package's own first-class defect class, named in
 * `widgets/toDomProps.ts`: a key that type-checks, reads as supported, and
 * silently never reaches the element (objectui#3290's `aria-required`,
 * objectui#3222's validation slot). Forwarding is not a widening: the keys were
 * already declared, and each widget still re-filters through its own
 * `toDomProps` before anything reaches a DOM element.
 *
 * `autoFocus`' original reason survives inside that set — an inline-edit host
 * enters edit mode ON a field and expects the caret to land there
 * (objectui#4220, the detail page's delegation) — and so does its property:
 * each widget's own whitelist carries these onto the real focusable control, so
 * nothing here needs to know which element that is. A host that passes nothing
 * is unaffected.
 *
 * The host's NON-DOM set is forwarded WHOLE too (`f08bcd9af`), through the
 * sibling executor `toHostProps`. The DOM fix left the other half of the
 * contract undelivered: `error`, `onUploadingChange` and the "Host plumbing"
 * block (`dataSource`, `dependentValues`, `dependsOn`, `dependsOnLabels`,
 * `emptyHint`, `onSelectRecord`, `onCreateNew`) still type-checked, read as
 * supported, and never reached the widget. `error` was the live one:
 * `InlineFieldInput` has passed `error={error}` since PR #7109 and this factory
 * dropped it, so a control that had failed validation never reported
 * `aria-invalid`. Forwarding is not a widening — every one of those keys is
 * already declared on `FieldWidgetComponentProps`, the same argument #7009
 * landed on in this file.
 *
 * ⛔ They do NOT go through `toDomProps`. None of them is DOM-legal, and that
 * whitelist is closed for exactly this reason — a `dataSource` adapter routed
 * there becomes `dataSource="[object Object]"` on an `<input>`, the leak the
 * helper exists to prevent. `toHostProps`' direction-3 assertion makes the two
 * sets provably disjoint, so the order of the two spreads below is not a
 * question anyone has to answer again.
 *
 * ## `dataSource` precedence: the explicit prop WINS
 *
 * Delivering `dataSource` can change behaviour where before it could not
 * arrive, because the relational widgets fall back to `SchemaRendererContext`
 * (which the grid already provides). The precedence is therefore STATED rather
 * than left to emerge: **a host's explicit `dataSource` prop wins over the
 * context**. That is not a new decision — `LookupField` already resolves
 * `props.dataSource ?? lookupField?.dataSource ?? fieldMeta?.dataSource ??
 * contextDataSource` and documents that order on the line that does it. This
 * factory is a CONDUIT and resolves nothing: adding a resolution here would
 * give `dataSource` a second author, the `field || schema` shape objectui#3233
 * removed. A host that passes no `dataSource` keeps reading the context exactly
 * as before, so no in-repo host changes behaviour. The full per-key precedence
 * table lives on `toHostProps`, next to the list it governs.
