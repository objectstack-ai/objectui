/**
 * The `summaryFields` chip beside the record H1 states ONE percentage
 * (objectui#8728).
 *
 * ## The defect, reproduced two-sided
 *
 * The chip draws a `percent` twice — as text and as a bar — and the two halves
 * scaled the same stored number by two different rules:
 *
 *     display = `${num}%`;                            // the text: no scaling
 *     const normalized = num <= 1 ? num * 100 : num;  // the bar: ratio, scaled
 *
 * Measured on `7f27bc543`, before the fix, with `fields: [{ name: 'ratio',
 * type: 'percent' }]`:
 *
 * | stored  | chip text | bar fill  | agree? |
 * |---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
 * | `0.123` | `0.123%`  | `12.3%`   | NO     |
 * | `12.3`  | `12.3%`   | `12.3%`   | yes    |
 *
 * Two-sided is the point: a one-sided reproduction cannot tell "this chip
 * contradicts itself" apart from "percent formatting is odd here". The second
 * row is also the CONTROL — it must read exactly as it does today, before and
 * after, and on both legs of the ablation.
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and why it is a RELATION
 *
 * Every row asserts that the bar draws the number the text states, clamped to
 * the track — not that a particular string appeared. A per-half assertion
 * ("text is `12.3%`", "bar is 12.3%") would go green on a repair that made both
 * halves wrong in a new matching way, which is precisely the failure this card
 * is about. The expected strings are pinned as well, because a relation alone
 * would go green on a chip that printed `0%` beside an empty bar for
 * everything.
 *
 * ## The boundary rows
 *
 * `EXACTLY 1` is the fork triage named: is a stored `1` one percent or one
 * hundred? This chip used to answer 100%, because that is what its bar already
 * drew and the ruling here was that the text follows the bar — an answer that
 * was this chip's alone, while `percentDisplayValue` in `@object-ui/core`, and
 * so the list cell, the dashboard measure and the grid column summary, all
 * rendered a stored `1` as `1%`.
 *
 * ⭐ objectui#9071 MOVED IT, and this is the row that recorded which way. That
 * card took the census this one asked for, found the local predicate to be the
 * only spelling of its kind on this side of the tree, and deleted it in favour
 * of the declared source. A stored `1` now reads `1%` here as it always did
 * everywhere else, and a stored `-5` reads `-5%` rather than `-500%`. The rows
 * below carry the new answers; what did NOT move — every value inside the band
 * the two rules always agreed on, the control among them — is the rest of this
 * table, unchanged. The two-places pin is
 * `summaryChip.percentSource-9071.test.tsx`; this file keeps stating the
 * relation objectui#8728 is about, that the chip's two halves never disagree
 * with EACH OTHER.
 *
 * ## Instruments
 *
 * - The chip is navigated by `[data-summary-chip="ratio"]`, never by
 *   `queryByText`: every summary value also renders in the body grid, and
 *   `queryByText` throws on multiple matches as well as on none.
 * - The bar's fill is read from the inline `width` — the one place the drawn
 *   percentage exists in the DOM. It is an author-declared, data-driven length,
 *   the carve-out the styling rule already grants this bar.
 * - The accessible name is asserted only for its PERCENTAGE — that it ends with
 *   the same text the chip shows. How the chip NAMES the field is objectui#8729,
 *   the serial card on this same render, and pinning that here would hand it a
 *   pin to fight for no reason.
