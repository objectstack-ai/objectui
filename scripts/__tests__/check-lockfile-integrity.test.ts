/**
 * objectui#8326 — the lockfile-integrity gate, pinned against the two causes it
 * was built for and against the three ways it could be worthless.
 *
 * The gate's own logic is exercised by `--self-test` inside the script (29
 * cases, synthetic lockfiles, no git). This file adds the three things a
 * synthetic corpus cannot say:
 *
 *   1. it is GREEN on this repository's real `pnpm-lock.yaml`;
 *   2. it is RED on the two real incident samples, built from that same real
 *      lockfile by a transformation this file asserts actually landed;
 *   3. it is wired — the workflow runs it, and the Dependabot merge gate
 *      classifies the check it produces.
 *
 * ⚠️ (2) matters more than it looks. A gate that is red on everything passes
 * both samples and is worthless, so every red assertion here is paired with a
 * green one over the same corpus.
