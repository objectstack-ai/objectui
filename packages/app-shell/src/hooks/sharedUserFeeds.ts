/**
 * sharedUserFeeds — ONE fetch per user-scoped feed, however many consumers mount
 *
 * Two console surfaces read the same two user-scoped streams:
 *
 *   | feed                     | producer                                   | consumers                          |
 *   | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
 *   | pending approvals count  | `GET /api/v1/approvals/requests?status=…`  | AppHeader bell badge + Approvals   |
 *   |                          |                                            | tab; Home's To-do card             |
 *   | recent activity          | `find('sys_activity', top 20, desc)`       | AppHeader bell Activity tab;       |
 *   |                          |                                            | Home's activity card               |
 *   | inbox messages           | `find('sys_inbox_message', top 20, desc)`  | AppHeader bell Notifications tab   |
 *   |                          | ⋈ `find('sys_notification_receipt')`       | + badge; Home's action centre      |
 *
 * Both consumers live in this package and, on `/home`, mount in the same tree
 * (`HomeLayout` renders the bell, `HomePage` renders the cards) — so each of
 * them owning its own effect meant the same read went out twice per page. That
 * is exactly the trade-off #4197 refused to accept as the price of un-gating
 * the bell: the fix is one fetch feeding both, not two fetches agreeing.
 *
 * The inbox feed joined them last (#4225). #4197 had left it out because the
 * two consumers asked genuinely different questions of the same object — and
 * #4316 measured what that cost: `useHomeInbox` never read the receipts, so
 * Home's "Needs your attention" counted messages the user had already read
 * while the bell two hundred pixels above correctly showed zero. Two panels,
 * one page load, disagreeing about the same rows. Deriving both from ONE feed
 * is what makes that disagreement structurally impossible rather than merely
 * fixed: there is no second read left to drift.
 *
 * Neither feed is app-scoped, so neither is gated on the header's `isApp`
 * flag. `isApp` still means something — it hides genuinely app-shell chrome
 * (presence avatars, the connection dot) — but the approvals inbox and the
 * activity feed are scoped to the *user* and the *tenant*, not to whichever
 * app happens to be in the URL. Gating them there is what left the bell's
 * Approvals and Activity tabs permanently empty on Home / Organizations / the
 * full-page AI screen, and what made the badge (`unread + approvals`) read a
 * different number on Home than inside an app for the same user.
 *
 * Why a module-scoped store rather than a context provider: both consumers are
 * already inside `@object-ui/app-shell`, so sharing needs no new dependency
 * edge — and a store needs no provider mounted above every call site, so the
 * one-fetch guarantee holds no matter where a consumer is rendered (the bell
 * is mounted by four different layouts). The dedupe is structural: consumers
 * cannot opt out of it by mounting somewhere unexpected.

 * collapses create/update/delete into one `field_change`, and drops

 * distinction between a create and a delete. What is shared instead is a PIN,

 * (no plugin-audit) and retires the feed for the rest of the page.
 *
 * ## Not asking, rather than asking and being told no (objectui#7476)
 *
 * A tenant environment has no `sys_activity`, so this read 404'd on every page
 * load. The 404 was already handled correctly at four layers — the adapter
 * memoizes the missing collection, its quiet logger demotes it to `debug`, the
 * feed retires as an ANSWER (`ready`, empty), and the panel renders its earned
 * 「暂无最近动态」 — but it was still one doomed request per load, and
 * `data-objectstack` states the rule for exactly this shape: the cure for a
 * doomed request is not issuing it.
 *
 * So the object registry (which the shell loads for the nav either way)
 * decides. It is a THREE-valued answer and only one value skips the read:
 *
 *   - not settled yet → no key, so nothing is asked and nothing is claimed.
 *     `useSharedFeed` hands a consumer the `idle` snapshot in that window,
 *     which is the honest one: this feed has not asked anything;
 *   - `absent` → `markUnavailable()` WITHOUT a request. Same terminal state the
 *     404 produced — `ready`, empty, poll stopped — so every consumer of this
 *     feed and the affirmative empty copy (#4315) are byte-for-byte unchanged;
 *   - `present` / `unknown` → the read, exactly as before. Every uncertainty
 *     lands here on purpose (see {@link useObjectPresence}): a registry with no
 *     provider, still loading, errored, or listing nothing is not evidence of
 *     absence, and a wrong `absent` would cost a real deployment its feed.

/**
 * The signed-in user's 20 most recent in-app inbox messages, joined with their
 * read-state receipts (ADR-0030 L5, the `mine` materialization).
 *
 * Two scoped reads, joined client-side, polled at 10s while the tab is
 * foregrounded — the bell's cadence, now the store's:
 *   - `sys_inbox_message` filtered by `user_id`, newest first, `$top: 20`.
 *   - `sys_notification_receipt` filtered by `user_id` + `channel:'inbox'`,
 *     narrowed to the notification ids that message read just listed
 *     (objectui#7392). Best-effort: if receipts are unavailable the inbox
 *     still renders (everything shows unread) rather than erroring.
 *
 * The receipt read used to ask for `$top: 200` of the user's receipts whatever
 * was listed, and `mergeInboxRows` then dropped every row that did not belong
 * to one of the 20 — a steady-state payload two orders of magnitude wider than
 * the answer it decorated, re-fetched in full at the 10s foreground cadence.
 * Its `$top` is now the id count, and that bound is EXACT rather than a guess:
 * `sys_notification_receipt` declares its key `{ fields: ['notification_id',
 * 'user_id', 'channel'], unique: true }`, so this filter can match at most one
 * row per id it names.
 *
 * ⚠️ The two reads are SEQUENTIAL where they used to be a `Promise.all`: the
 * receipt query cannot be written until the message read says which
 * notifications are in the window. That is one extra round trip per tick, on a
 * background poll, against ~200 rows saved on each of them.
 *
 * ⛔ What this does NOT change is the bell's unread number, and that is the
 * one thing a narrowing here could have broken silently. The badge is
 * `unreadTopics + pendingApprovalsCount` (`InboxPopover`), and `unreadTopics`
 * folds THIS feed's rows — which are `mergeInboxRows`' output, one per
 * `sys_inbox_message` row. So the inbox addend has been "unread within the
 * `$top: 20` window" since #4225 gave the two surfaces one feed; the receipt
 * set never contributed a row to it, only a read-state to rows the message
 * query had already chosen. Home's `unreadTopicCount` folds the same rows the
 * same way (#4329). A receipt outside the window changed no number before this
 * change and changes none after it.
 *
 * This is the SUPERSET both consumers cut from. The bell lists all 20 and
 * badges the unread topics; Home's action centre takes the unread ones, newest
 * first, capped at its own smaller limit. Neither issues a read of its own, so
 * the two cannot disagree about a row's read-state — the #4316 defect is not
 * merely fixed here, it is unreachable.
 *
 * Degrades to empty when the messaging pipeline is absent (404 /
 * `OBJECT_NOT_FOUND`) and retires the poll; every other failure is reported as
 * `error` so a denial cannot reach a consumer wearing the shape of an empty
 * inbox (#4235, objectstack#7344).
