/**
 * `requiredPermissions` on `record:highlights` and `record:related_list` — the
 * BLOCK-LEVEL gate (objectui#10155) — and its deliberate ABSENCE on
 * `record:details` (objectui#10200).
 *
 * ## What this file pins
 *
 * The key is an **ADR-0066 system capability set** — the one meaning the word
 * carries on `action`, `app`, `field` and `bulkAction` — read through the
 * permission context's capability path and gating **fail-closed**: an unheld
 * or unrecognised capability hides the block. objectui#10058 settled that for
 * `record:quick_actions`; the record blocks carried the identical call and
 * were untouched by it.
 *
 * They used to read `perms.can(objectName, name)`, whose second argument
 * is the closed object-action enum. Under the stock `/me/permissions` provider
 * a name outside the eight mapped verbs falls through that provider's
 * `?? 'allowRead'` tail to the object's read bit — so a capability nobody
 * holds passed for every reader of the object, silently.
 *
 * ⚠️ `record:details` carried the same gate until objectui#10200. Its
 * contract, `@objectstack/spec`'s strict `RecordDetailsProps`, deliberately
 * does not declare the key, so by maintainer ruling the renderer stopped
 * reading it there: a `record:details` document carrying the key no longer
 * gates the block. That block is pinned below as the inverse, against the same
 * stock provider verdict that still closes its siblings.
 *
 * ⭐ Every pin below mounts a REAL stock provider and reads its real verdicts.
 * A mocked `usePermissions` cannot discriminate the two reading paths — it IS
 * whichever path the mock chooses to implement, which is how this family's
 * earlier pins came to pass on a gate that does not gate.
 *
 * ⛔ Not to be confused with an `ActionDef`'s OWN `requiredPermissions`, the
 * per-action field `ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation` filters on, nor with
 * `useCapabilityGate`'s per-action gate in `@object-ui/react`.
