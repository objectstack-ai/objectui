/**
 * ObjectUI — the fence-opening predicate has ONE authority (objectui#9194)
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `check-doc-component-types.mjs` and `check-doc-expression-carriage.mjs` each
 * carried the same opening-fence predicate, verbatim, and the same wrong answer
 * with it: `(\S*)` greedy over non-space read a FOUR-backtick opener as a
 * three-backtick opener in a language named with a leading backtick. The
 * nesting then inverted — the four-backtick line opened, the real inner opener
 * closed, and the code between them was read as prose by both gates while the
 * per-language census grew a column for a language that does not exist and the
 * coverage figures counted two empty non-fences as successfully parsed.
 *
 * ## What this file pins, in the order the failures would arrive
 *
 *  1. **The rule**, on the module that now owns it — CommonMark's: a run of
 *     three or more opens, and only a run of the same character that is at least
 *     as long closes.
 *  2. **The shape, not the instance** — an ODD number of stray four-backtick
 *     markers is what desynchronises pairing for the rest of a file. The fixture
 *     below carries exactly one, and both gates are driven over it. Pinning only
 *     the even-count page that this card was filed for would pin the accident,
 *     not the hazard.
 *  3. **The corpus invariant** — no fence language on either gate's real scan
 *     surface may carry a backtick.
 *  4. **The recurrence guard** — neither gate may grow a private fence
 *     predicate again. That is the half the card's own closing sentence asks
 *     for: two copies that are separately correct today are two copies that
 *     drift silently tomorrow, and a fix applied to one can leave the other
 *     behind.
