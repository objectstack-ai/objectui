/**
 * Client-side evaluation of field-level conditional rules
 * (`visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen`).
 *
 * These predicates are authored as CEL — the *same* dialect the server
 * enforces in `@objectstack/objectql`'s rule-validator (`requiredWhen`) and
 * `stripReadonlyWhenFields` (`readonlyWhen`). To guarantee the client UX and
 * the server enforcement reach the *identical* verdict for a given record we
 * delegate to the canonical engine, `@objectstack/formula`'s
 * `ExpressionEngine`, rather than re-implementing a parallel evaluator. See
 * ADR-0036 (field-level conditional rules) and the framework's
 * `packages/formula` "No private expression DSL" note.
 *
 * A predicate is `string | { dialect, source }`. A bare string is treated as
 * CEL (mirrors the server's `toExpression`). Evaluation is *fail-open* for
 * visibility/required (a broken predicate must not hide a field or wrongly
 * block submit) and *fail-open* for readonly (a broken predicate leaves the
 * field editable).
 *
 * Fail-open agrees with the server for MOST faults — but not for all, and the
 * exception is the half worth knowing. Since objectstack#4889 a `readonlyWhen`
 * predicate that faults because it names a scope ROOT the write never bound —
 * `parent.status == 'paid'` with no master-detail header in hand — is
 * fail-CLOSED on the server: `isReadonlyWhenLocked` warns and then returns
 * TRUE, i.e. LOCKED (a declared lock is not waived merely because it could not
 * be evaluated), and `stripReadonlyWhenFields` — plus
 * `stripReadonlyWhenFieldsMulti` on the bulk path — DELETES that key from the
 * UPDATE payload. This file keeps the same fault fail-OPEN. For that one class
 * the two ends therefore point in OPPOSITE directions, deliberately: the
 * framework's ADR-0124 D1 — server enforces, client is courtesy — makes the
 * server the authority, so the courtesy layer does not get to guess "locked"
 * and grey out a field the server might have accepted.
 *
 * The caller-visible consequence, spelled out because the symptom is silent:
 * the form renders the field EDITABLE, the user edits it, the save reports
 * SUCCESS, and the new value never lands — the server dropped the key and kept
 * the persisted one. Debug that toward the SERVER-side lock (its `… treating
 * the field as LOCKED` warning, and the write response's `droppedFields`), not
 * toward the client predicate, which did exactly what it was asked to. The
 * other two halves carry no such carve-out: `requiredWhen` binds the same
 * `parent` scope but deliberately kept fail-open semantics (objectstack#4977),
 * so an unevaluable requirement is skipped on BOTH ends, and field-level
 * `visibleWhen` is not a server concept at all.
 *
 * Fail-open is **loud**, not silent (objectstack#5149): a predicate that
 * cannot be evaluated — parse error, unbound identifier, engine fault — logs
 * one `console.warn` per predicate text with the source and the failure
 * reason, then still returns the caller's fallback. Without the warning a
 * broken predicate is indistinguishable from an absent one, so
 * conditional-visibility bugs survive inspection indefinitely. This is the
 * client half of the server's "log and allow" convention for the faults where
 * the two ends DO agree (`readonlyWhen for 'x' failed to evaluate — change
 * allowed through` — the GENERIC-fault message; the unbound-root fault above
 * logs `treating the field as LOCKED` instead). The *default* stays
 * fail-open on purpose — flipping it is a shipped-behavior change tracked
 * separately in objectstack#5149 (appeal 1, undecided).
 *
 * A predicate the author DECLARED and left BLANK is loud too, since
 * objectui#8069 — and it did not used to be. It is a third state, not a
 * spelling of either neighbour: the key is present (so it is not "no rule")
 * and nothing evaluates (so no engine fault is raised), and it used to return
 * the caller's permissive fallback before any warning could fire. `''` and
 * `'   '` are authorable — `ExpressionWireSchema` is a bare `z.string()`, and
 * `resolveFieldRuleState`'s own guard is `!= null` — so the one state an author
 * reaches by *starting* a rule and not finishing it was the one state that said
 * nothing at all. Both spellings now report `[blank]` through the same single
 * site as every other fault; the VERDICT is unchanged for every input.

 * Evaluate a field-rule CEL predicate against a record.
 *
 * ## `fallback` is a per-CALL-SITE policy, not a default this helper owns
 *
 * The parameter is required and carries no default value, so every call site
 * states a direction of its own — and the directions in this repo do not
 * agree. Five distinct fault policies share this one helper today, which is
 * readable nowhere but here (objectui#8069):
 *
 * 1. **Fixed permissive, paired with an equal "no rule" literal.**
 *    {@link resolveFieldRuleState} (`true` / `false` / `false`) and
 *    `resolveVisibleOptions` (`evaluator/optionRules.ts`, `true`). A fault
 *    produces the permissive verdict, indistinguishable from the verdict for
 *    "the author wrote no rule" — see the `…_FAULTED` / `…_ABSENT` note below.
 * 2. **Fixed permissive, unguarded — ONE literal answers absent *and*
 *    faulted.** Every visibility call site outside core: the form renderer
 *    (`components/renderers/form/form.tsx`), console's `FormPage`, app-shell's
 *    `ScreenView`, `plugin-form`'s `WizardForm`. All of them pass `true`, and
 *    none has a separate absent branch at all.
 * 3. **Caller-parameterised.** `evalRowPredicate`'s single-eval fast route
 *    (`evaluator/listConditional.ts`) forwards `opts.fallback`, so the
 *    direction is the mounting surface's to state.
 * 4. **Divergence probe → fault FLAG.** `evalCel`
 *    (`evaluator/listConditional.ts`) calls this helper once per direction with
 *    `warn: false` + `onFault`: a verdict that tracks the fallback in BOTH runs
 *    is a fault, and the caller emits its own labelled warning and returns its
 *    own fallback.
 * 5. **Divergence probe → THROW.** `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluateCelCondition`
 *    under `throwOnError` runs the same two-call trick and converts the
 *    disagreement into `throw new Error('CEL predicate failed to evaluate: …')`.
 *
 * ⚠️ The last two policies exist **because** `fallback` is free to specify: they
 * detect a fault by disagreeing with themselves. Any proposal to fix a
 * direction *inside* this helper — objectui#8069's open question — removes the
 * mechanism they are built on, so read them before writing one.
 *
 * @param pred      The `visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` predicate.
 * @param record    The live form values (overlays prior persisted record).
 * @param fallback  Value to return when the predicate is ABSENT (`null` /
 *                  `undefined`), and — separately — the value returned when a
 *                  present predicate cannot be evaluated. ⚠️ Those are two
 *                  questions this one parameter answers with one value; a
 *                  caller that wants different answers must branch before the
 *                  call, as {@link resolveFieldRuleState} does. The historic
 *                  advice is to pick the *safe* default (`false` for
 *                  readonly/required — don't lock/block on error; `true` for
 *                  visibility — don't hide on error); whether "safe" is the
 *                  right axis is objectui#8069's open question.
 * @param previous  The prior persisted record, if any (for `previous.*` refs).
 * @param scope     Extra top-level scope variables bound alongside `record` —
 *                  e.g. `{ parent }` so an inline line-item cell can reference
 *                  its header (`parent.status == 'paid'`) as well as its own
 *                  row (`record.quantity`). Bound via the engine's `extra`.
 * @param diagnostic  Failure-warning options: a `context` locator for the
 *                  one-time warning, and `warn: false` for callers that probe
 *                  for faults and report them themselves. The returned value
 *                  is unaffected either way.

 *
 * ⚠️ These answer **"what should the form do when this rule is BROKEN?"** —
 * *not* "what should the form do when the author declared NO rule?" That
 * second question is answered separately, by the `…_ABSENT` set below. The two
 * sets hold pairwise EQUAL values today, and that equality is a copy, not an
 * implication: each `rules.<key> != null` ternary answers the absent case with
 * its own literal and hands `evalFieldPredicate` the same literal as the fault
 * fallback beside it, so every permissive value is written twice and the "it
 * broke" answer was chosen by aligning it with the "it is absent" answer next
 * to it. Nothing was *inherited* from a shared default — `evalFieldPredicate`'s
 * `fallback` parameter is required and has none (objectui#8069 measured both
 * halves).
 *
 * All three directions are the PERMISSIVE one, so a single mistyped column in
 * one authored predicate yields a form that shows more, locks less and demands
 * less — three faults from one typo, composing rather than cancelling. That is
 * objectui#8069's open question and it is deliberately NOT decided here.
 *
 * **What the history records** (read on full, unshallowed history — a shallow
 * clone answers this with one commit and no warning): the direction *was*
 * reasoned about, once, when the helper landed (objectui#1578). This module's
 * head and ADR-0036 both record the same rationale — the fallbacks are "chosen
 * so a fault is *safe*: `true` for visibility (don't hide content on error),
 * `false` for required/readonly (don't block submit or lock a field on
 * error)". What no commit records is the COMPOSITION: every recorded argument
 * is per-key, and the case where all three faults arrive from one typo was
 * never put. objectstack#5149 then removed the SILENCE and left the direction
 * explicitly undecided ("appeal 1").
 *
 * ⛔ These values are shipped behaviour. Changing one is not a refactor, it is
 * objectui#8069's decision — and objectui#6958 leans on the `visibleWhen` half
 * staying fail-open (a broken predicate must never silently null a stored
