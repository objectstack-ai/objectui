/**
 * THE IDENTITY PROPERTY HOLDS FOR A REST-LESS TUPLE (objectui#9088).
 *
 * `../zod/imported-defaults.ts` states the property in the walker's own
 * docblock: "A node is rebuilt ONLY if the walk actually changed something
 * beneath it. A subtree with no `ZodDefault` in it therefore comes back
 * REFERENCE-EQUAL to the spec's own object." That is decision batch #90's
 * reversibility argument made literal, and it is the argument on which option A
 * was taken over option B.
 *
 * It was false for EVERY rest-less tuple, and the contradiction was one
 * operator wide.
 *
 * ## The mechanism
 *
 * Zod 4.4.3 spells "no rest element" as `def.rest === null` — a real, OWN key
 * holding `null`. Measured over the whole shipped `zod@4.4.3/v4` tree (176 files,
 * 88 `.js` + 88 `.cjs`), the statement that mints it,
 * `const rest = hasRest ? _paramsOrRest : null`, occurs at 6 locations — 3
 * logical sites x 2 module formats: `classic/schemas.{js,cjs}`,
 * `mini/schemas.{js,cjs}` and `core/api.{js,cjs}`, the last being where zod's
 * `tuple` factory lives.
 *
 * ⚠️ The count is pinned to zod 4.4.3 and to that corpus. An earlier revision of
 * this docblock said "exactly one site" and named `classic/schemas.cjs` alone —
 * a 2-file corpus that excluded `core/api.cjs`, which is precisely the file the
 * `tuple` factory is in. A census is only reproducible if its corpus is stated
 * AND its corpus is the one that could have contradicted it.
 *
 * The `tuple` arm normalised the other side of the comparison to `undefined`:
 *
 *     const rest = def.rest ? walk(def.rest) : undefined;   // the defect
 *
 * `unchanged` compares by `===`, and `null === undefined` is `false`. So the
 * pair never matched, the arm always took the `cloneWithDef` branch, and a
 * tuple with nothing to strip beneath it was rebuilt anyway.
 *
 * ⛔ The repair is to stop normalising — `: def.rest` — so a `null` is compared
 * against a `null`. ⛔ NOT to relax `unchanged` to `==`: that would make
 * `null == undefined` true for every arm at once and paper over a real zod-4
 * spelling distinction other arms may come to depend on.
 *
 * ## What this file pins
 *
 *  1. **The zod facts the fix rests on.** If a later zod spells "no rest
 *     element" as an absent key, or starts minting `null` into a def member the
 *     walker reads, that must be RED here rather than rediscovered later.
 *  2. **The subject**, plus the two controls that fire the other way — a tuple
 *     WITH a rest element, and a schema with no tuple at all — so a green here
 *     cannot come from the identity property being trivially true.
 *  3. **⭐ The rebuild half, for BOTH shapes.** Compare-like-with-like fixes the
 *     comparison; it must not change what the clone produces when the walk DID
 *     change something. A rest-less tuple that is legitimately rebuilt must
 *     still come out with `def.rest === null`, not `undefined`.
 *  4. **⛔ The other direction (binding from objectui#9102).** The input graph
 *     is `@objectstack/spec`'s own, shared with every workspace consumer, so
 *     nothing here may mutate it — and a subtree with no `ZodDefault` must
 *     still come back reference-equal.
 *  5. **The `:246`@`b8a006883d` = `:274`@head verdict**, which is the triage
 *     fence's census answered as a measurement rather than read off the tuple
 *     result. (The `def.out` site moved because the repair's own comment block
 *     was inserted above it; a quoted line is only a measurement against a
 *     stated sha.)
 *
 * ⭐ Every assertion below records the removal that proves it — the mutation
 * that makes THIS assertion red. A proof that lives only in a pull-request body
 * is one refactor away from vacuous.

/**
 * ⭐ THE COUNTING RULE, published beside the number, because a number without

 *
 *  - CORPUS: every subpath in `@objectstack/spec`'s own `exports` map except
 *    `./package.json` and `./openapi.json`, read from the map rather than
 *    listed; every named export of each that answers `isZod` is a ROOT.
 *  - WALK: each root is paired with `stripImportedDefaults(root)` and the two
 *    are descended in lockstep by LABELLED children. A `before` node is
 *    counted ONCE, on first arrival (shared subgraphs are not double-counted).
 *    Depth cap 60.
 *  - DENOMINATOR `nodesVisited`: distinct `before` nodes reached.
 *  - NUMERATOR `referenceEqualNodes`: those for which `before === after`. A
 *    reference-equal node ENDS that branch — its subtree is equal by identity,
 *    so descending it would count nodes the walk never had to consider.
 *
 * ⚠️ That last clause is why this figure is NOT comparable to a whole-graph
 * node count, and it is the same rule `imported-defaults-describe-9034.test.ts`
 * uses, so the two files' figures ARE comparable to each other.
 *
 * ⭐ AND IT IS THE WRONG INSTRUMENT FOR THIS CARD, which is worth writing down
 * because the figure moves the COUNTERINTUITIVE way. Terminating at reference
 * equality means a node that BECOMES reference-equal takes its whole subtree out
 * of the count — so repairing the `tuple` arm made both the numerator and the
 * denominator SHRINK, and the ratio drift slightly DOWN, while strictly more of
 * the surface is reference-equal than before. Read alone, that looks like a
 * regression; it is the rule working as designed.
 *
 * ⇒ RULE B, below, is the instrument that answers this card. It walks the
 * BEFORE graph exhaustively — never terminating early — so the denominator is a
 * FIXED corpus of distinct spec nodes that does not move when the fix lands, and
 * the numerator can only rise. Both rules are reported; neither is a summary of
 * the other.
