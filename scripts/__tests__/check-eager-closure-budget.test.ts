 * that literal, the checker's own frozen `BASELINE.chunks`, and the figure the
 * gate's verdict line printed were three DIFFERENT numbers, with no check red
 * anywhere across the spread, because nothing fails on a stale number in a
 * comment. The count was never load-bearing either: the sentence is rhetorical
 * ("one total over N chunks cannot say WHERE the payload moved"), which is
 * exactly why nothing caught it. Refreshing the literal to today's reading would
 * have turned three numbers into two and restarted the clock; this makes the

 * unanchored one is a standing claim about the live closure, which moves on most
 * builds. The same distinction is why objectui#7528 declined to file
 * `vite-declared-lazy-views.ts`'s "42.5 KB of headroom": it sits in a paragraph
 * dated to a `b98352a15` measurement and reads as history.
 *

 *
 *   - NUMERALS qualifying a CHUNK noun. "144 modules" and "166 modules" are
 *     module counts inside anchored change records, not claims about the shape
 *     of the closure, and none of them rots when a chunk is added.
 *   - OWN-LINE comments — block comments and `//` lines, the form every
 *     paragraph of prose in these two files is written in.
 *   - The anchor window is a paragraph PLUS the one before it, because the
 *     header writes its lead-in ("Measured on `77f846a8b`:") and its table as
 *     two paragraphs. A sha cannot reach across code: a code line breaks the
 *     paragraph, so a hash in one block never anchors a count in another.
 *
 * The window is a heuristic in one direction and is left that way knowingly: a
 * lead-in paragraph anchors what follows it, so a hash written for one reason can
 * vouch for a count beside it. It errs toward ALLOWING, which is the tolerable
 * side for a check on prose — the intolerable side is a standing claim nobody
 * refuses. The two legs of the reader's own self-test above hold each direction.
 *
 * `.github/workflows/performance-budget.yml` joined this population in
 * objectui#7850 — the same rule, the same reader, no second matcher. Its prose
 * is `#` comments rather than `/**` blocks, so it reaches the reader through
 * `yamlProse` below, which translates the marker and nothing else.
 *
 * Its one obstacle was settled by REWORDING, not by an exemption. The workflow
 * counted chunks once as the OUTCOME of a hazard — a `"sideEffects": false`
 * that is statically coherent while the registrations it governs reach no chunk
 * at all, objectui#6535 — which is structural, has no build that can move it,
 * and which this reader cannot tell from a population count. That sentence now
 * states the outcome without a numeral, so the reader needs no exception to be
 * right about it; the alternative was an exemption entry, and exemption lists
 * are how a pin decays.
 *
 * ⚠️ The workflow's frozen-SIZE prose is a DIFFERENT class and is deliberately
 * OUT of this pin — named here so nobody widens a count pin into a size pin by
 * accident. The 350 KB entry line, the 89 KiB regression and the byte figures
 * measured on `77f846a8b` are sizes, and a pin for them would have to tell a
 * ceiling's value from the several sizes that paragraph legitimately carries,
 * which this test does not do.
 *
 * Only the negative half is asserted. A positive "the prose names the verdict
 * line" pin would fix a wording, and what has to stay true is narrower: that no
 * number is written here which the next build could falsify.
