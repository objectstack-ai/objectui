 * before this issue was even filed):
 *   - `title`: `PageAccordionRenderer` (`renderers/layout/containers.tsx`)
 *     reads `items`, `allowMultiple`, `variant` — never `schema.title`, and
 *     there is no accordion-level heading in the rendered output.
 *     `PageAccordionProps` never declared a `title` member either, so this
 *     was dead on BOTH sides, not merely unread by one renderer.
 *   - items `value`: the renderer OVERWRITES it — `itemsWithValue =
 *     items.map((it, idx) => ({ ...it, value: `panel-${idx}` }))` — so an
 *     authored value never reaches the Radix item. `PageAccordionProps.items[]`
 *     deliberately does not declare `value` either, and carries a `guidance`
 *     prescription (added with the #5212 spec-side half) telling an author
 *     who writes it by hand to remove the key.
 *
 * Neither is symmetric with `page:tabs`: one component over, an authored
 * `items[].value` IS read, with a `tab-${idx}` fallback only when absent
 * (`itemsWithValue` for `page:tabs`, same file) — and the designer control
 * there is NAMED `value` since objectui#8278, which is what makes the two
 * comparable; until then it was named `key`, so the tabs panel wrote a key
 * the spec refuses by name and the renderer never reads.

/**
 * `object-kanban` — the panel that could not author a valid board (objectui#7772).
 *
 * Same PUBLISH-FACE-with-no-parity-gate reasoning as the two describes above,
 * and this block is where that gap cost the most.
 * `scripts/check-designer-field-key-parity.mjs` judges `PAYLOAD_SHAPES` — the
 * field / object / permission payloads — and does not read `BLOCK_CONFIG` at
 * all, so nothing mechanical compared this panel's four fields against
 * `ObjectKanbanSchema`. What that hid was not one stale key but a matched pair:
 *
 *   - the ONLY control able to set grouping wrote `groupField`, which
 *     `ObjectKanban.tsx` reads at zero sites (`schema.groupBy` at thirteen in
 *     the same query, so that zero is a reading) and which objectui#7322
 *     retired BY NAME — `retirementTombstone()` on the zod face, `?: never` on
 *     the TS one;
 *   - `groupBy`, which the same card declared (REQUIRED then; OPTIONAL since
 *     objectui#8990, which aligned it with `@objectstack/spec`), had no control
 *     at all.
 *
 * So the panel stably emitted a node that carried a name-retired key and no
 * lane key at all, and rendered a board that grouped nothing with no diagnostic
 * anywhere. ⚠️ Under today's contract the missing lane key is no longer itself a
 * refusal — which is precisely why the CONTROL that the panel offers a `groupBy`
 * box matters more than it did: the schema no longer backstops its absence. `limit` is the third declared key it never offered:
 * `ObjectKanban.tsx` sends it as a real `$top`, so a board over
 * `DEFAULT_KANBAN_LIMIT` records was silently truncated with no way to widen it.
 *
 * The parse probes below are the instrument this surface otherwise lacks: they
 * read the CONTRACT rather than a spelling, so the next control added here is
 * measured against the schema instead of against a reviewer's memory.
