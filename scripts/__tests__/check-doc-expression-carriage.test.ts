 * landed. That posture is the first thing asserted here, because it is the thing
 * a later edit could quietly reverse.
 *
 * The second is that the instrument can SEE. A census that runs, goes green and
 * looked at nothing is the counterfeit this shape of gate produces most easily
 * (objectstack#4928, objectui#4690), so the controls are exercised in both
