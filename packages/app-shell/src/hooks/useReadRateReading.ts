 * useReadRateReading — the console's data hook for the tenant runtime's
 * read-rate reading (objectui#9954, cloud#2333).
 *
 * Reads `GET {apiBase}/usage/storage` and exposes the ONE key of that response
 * this repo carries a contract for: the optional nested `readRate`. The rest of
 * the storage-usage payload is deliberately NOT modelled here — no contract for
 * it reached this side, and inventing one would be a second, unowned copy of a
 * shape the control plane owns.
 *
 * ## Why the three "no banner" answers stay three values
 *
 * A banner renders only on `state: 'anomalous'`, so silence, `'ok'` and an
 * unreachable endpoint all render nothing. They are NOT the same fact, and
 * collapsing them in the code is the defect this hook exists to prevent:
 *
 *   - `'unmeasured'` — the endpoint answered and carried NO `readRate`. The
 *     control plane reported no reading. It does NOT mean "measured and under
 *     the line"; "why does my environment show no banner" has two answers and
 *     this is the one that says *nobody has measured it*.
 *   - `'measured'` + `state: 'ok'` — measured, and under the line.
 *   - `'unavailable'` — nothing trustworthy came back at all (network, non-2xx,
 *     or a `readRate` that does not match the contract). Deliberately NOT folded
 *     into `'unmeasured'`: that status is a positive claim about what the
 *     control plane said, and a failed read gives no basis to make it.
 *
 * ## Contract-first parsing (AGENTS.md #0.1)
 *
 * An off-contract `readRate` — an unknown `state`, a missing/!numeric
 * `ratioThreshold` — is reported as `'unavailable'`, never coerced into a
 * reading. The one shape that IS accepted in two spellings is an ABSENT
 * `readsPerWrite`: `undefined` and JSON `null` are the two ways a serializer
 * spells an omitted optional, and that value's absence is load-bearing — it is
 * the environment having made no writes at all, the worst reading there is. A
 * strict reading of `null` as off-contract would HIDE that case, which is
 * exactly the failure the card forbids. Any OTHER non-numeric value is
 * off-contract and is refused.
 *
 * ## No refetch loop
 *
 * Unlike the AI usage meter beside it, this reading is a slow control-plane
 * aggregate over the environment's whole read history — nothing a user does in
 * the console moves it within a session. So the hook fetches once per mount /
 * apiBase change and exposes `refetch` for a caller that wants another look;
 * there is no visibility or event-driven refresh to spend requests on.
 *
 * Fail-soft throughout: every failure path lands on a status the caller can
 * read, never a throw.
 *
