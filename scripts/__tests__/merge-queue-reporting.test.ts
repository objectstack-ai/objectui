/**
 * objectui#3523 — the merge queue was enforced and validated nothing.
 *
 * Two independent holes produced one P0, and this file pins both shut, because
 * each of them is invisible in exactly the way that makes CI look healthy.
 *
 *  1. **Nothing subscribed `merge_group`.** A ruleset requires every change to
 *     land through the merge queue (#3243 measured a direct push to `main`
 *     returning 405 `Changes must be made through the merge queue`), yet not one
 *     of the repository's workflows carried the trigger — repo-wide
 *     `event=merge_group` runs stood at total_count = 0, historically. A queue
 *     nothing subscribes to can only carry an EMPTY required-check set, so it
 *     rebuilt each pull request on the current `main` and let it through without
 *     running anything. On 2026-08-07 #3503, #3510 and #3516 all merged with
 *     `Type Check` at conclusion=failure, on a `main` that #3498 had left with a
 *     TS2578; #3505 hot-fixed the result.
 *
 *  2. **`paths-ignore` on the `pull_request` trigger.** `paths-ignore` skips the
 *     WHOLE workflow when every changed file matches, and GitHub has no per-job
 *     path filter, so a docs-only or changeset-only PR started neither `ci.yml`
 *     nor `lint.yml` — #3509 measured zero check runs from them. A check that is
 *     never created does not fail a required-status-check rule, it leaves the PR
 *     pending forever; inside the queue it fails on the ruleset's 60-minute
 *     status-check timeout. So none of those contexts could be made required
 *     while the filter lived on the trigger, which is why the queue's required
 *     set was empty in the first place. `control-bytes.yml` and `docs-links.yml`
 *     had already reached this conclusion for themselves — their headers say a
 *     gate a markdown-only PR cannot start "rebuilds the hole it exists to
 *     close" — but the two heavyweight workflows had not.
 *
 * The fix is deliberately ordered: subscribe the trigger first (pure addition),
 * then move the path decision from the trigger into the jobs, and only then may
 * a maintainer write these contexts into the branch-protection and queue
 * required sets. Reversing that order deadlocks the whole repository, which is
 * what the assertions below exist to prevent someone re-doing by halves.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted: which contexts are actually required. That lives in
 * repository settings, which no test in this repo can read and no agent may
 * change.

 * `filename -> why this workflow must subscribe merge_group`.
 *
 * Hand-maintained, and it carries the REASONS only — since objectui#6160 it no
 * longer decides the MEMBERSHIP. `DERIVED_MERGE_GROUP_FLOOR` below does that,
 * out of `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS`.
 *
 * The header this replaced said the set could not be derived at all, because
 * "may this context be required?" is a property of the repository's settings and
 * not of the YAML. That premise is still true and the conclusion no longer
 * follows: `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS` in `scripts/dependabot-merge-gate.mjs` is already
 * a human's written-down answer to exactly that question, so deriving from it
 * mechanises nothing — it stops one judgement being written down twice in two
 * files that then drift apart. Which is what happened: the map named six
 * workflows while eight produced an unfiltered blocking check, and by the time
 * anyone acted on that it was seven against ten, because PR #6159 added its own
 * entry by hand without closing the class (objectui#6160).
 *
 * Two mechanical honesty checks keep what is left of it true: an entry naming a
 * workflow that no longer exists fails, so the list cannot rot into a
 * comfortable fiction the way a stale count does (#3261); and an entry naming a
 * workflow that produces no required context fails, so this map can only ever be
 * a SUBSET of the derived floor and the derivation cannot silently narrow past
 * it.

/**
 * The floor, DERIVED — objectui#6160.
 *
 * ## What it is protecting
 *
 * `main` sits behind an enforced merge queue (#3243). A context the repository
 * REQUIRES, produced by a workflow that does not subscribe `merge_group`, never
 * reports on the queue build — and a required check that never reports does not
 * FAIL the queue, it STALLS it until the ruleset's 60-minute status-check
 * timeout. That is the whole reason a floor exists here at all: objectui#3523,
 * where nothing subscribed, the queue's required set could therefore only be
 * empty, and #3503 / #3510 / #3516 merged on 2026-08-07 with `Type Check` at
 * `conclusion=failure`.
 *
 * ## Why it derives instead of being listed
 *
 * `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS` is the other place this repository writes down "this check
 * is blocking and reports on every pull request". Every name in it is a check a
 * maintainer may put in the required set, so every workflow producing one is
 * exactly a workflow that must subscribe `merge_group`. Reading the membership
 * off that list instead of off a second hand-kept one means a gate added to
 * `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS` is inside this floor the moment it is added, with nobody
 * having to remember a second file.
 *
 * The check names come from `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS`; the name -> workflow-file
 * mapping is `producedCheckNames()`, the same parser
 * `dependabot-merge-gate.test.ts` partitions its buckets with. One parser, so
 * the two files cannot disagree about which workflow produces what.
 *
 * ## The precondition, and why it is pinned rather than assumed
 *
 * A derived floor is an improvement only while it is a SUPERSET of what the hand
 * map named. A derivation that quietly narrows would read as more coverage while
 * asserting less — this card's own defect, one level up. So the containment is
 * itself an assertion below ("loses nothing the hand-maintained map named"), and
 * so is the resolvability of every `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS` name: a renamed check that
 * resolves to no workflow drops that workflow out of the floor silently, which is
 * the same narrowing wearing a different hat.
 *
 * Measured on this tree when the derivation landed: every one of the map's
 * entries produces a `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS` check (nothing is lost) and every
 * workflow producing one subscribes `merge_group` (the floor is satisfiable
 * today, and no workflow YAML needed changing — the missing thing was the
 * assertion, not the trigger).

/**
 * The page's copy of the same list (objectui#4154).
 *
 * `content/docs/guide/ci-cd-pipeline.md` opened its `## Merge Queue` section with
 * "Five workflows subscribe:" and named five, while the map above held six — the
 * page went stale the moment objectui#3735 added `skills-paths.yml`, and stale
 * prose reads exactly as authoritative as fresh prose. That is objectui#3261's
 * defect one subsystem over, and it lands on the one reader the paragraph is
 * written for: someone deciding whether a new gate of theirs has to subscribe.
 *
 * The page now points at `MUST_SUBSCRIBE_MERGE_GROUP` instead of copying it, and
 * these assertions keep it that way. The honest caveat, recorded rather than
 * hidden: this pins a copy to a copy, since the map is itself hand-maintained.
 * What makes that trade worth taking is that the map is read by an assertion —
 * a member that stops subscribing fails the first test in this file, and a member
 * that stops existing fails the second — while prose is read by no one until it
 * has already misled someone.
 *
 * Two paragraphs, two different rules, because they are two different kinds of
 * claim:
 *
 *   - the LIVE claim ("which workflows subscribe") may not enumerate and may not
 *     count. It cannot go stale if it holds no instances;
 *   - the DATED clause (those four did not subscribe until objectui#3523, PR
 *     #3722) keeps its four names. A past fact cannot drift, and the sentence
 *     needs them: "none of the first four" has no antecedent once the live list
 *     is gone.
 *
 * The exemption is therefore granted per PARAGRAPH, anchored on the #3523 link,
 * rather than to the four names anywhere in the section — otherwise a future
 * present-tense sentence naming exactly those four would pass while being short
 * by every subscriber added since, which is this issue verbatim.
 *
 * The residual hole, stated rather than left for the next reader to find: a
 * present-tense list of exactly those four names, written INSIDE the dated
 * paragraph and carrying no count, still passes. That is a sentence someone has
 * to author deliberately and falsely; what these assertions exist to stop is
 * DRIFT, and a page holding no live list cannot drift — a seventh subscriber
 * changes nothing on it. Every other spelling of the old sentence is red: five of
 * the six names outside the dated paragraph, any of the two later ones inside it,
 * and any cardinality anywhere in the section.
