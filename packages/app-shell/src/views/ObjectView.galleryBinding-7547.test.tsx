/**
 * objectui#7547 — the object page must not invent a GALLERY cover binding.
 *
 * The third sibling of `ObjectView.calendarBinding-7029` (calendar) and
 * `ObjectView.ganttBinding-7070` (gantt dates) next door, and the last member
 * of that class this face still carried: `imageField` was floored at `'image'`
 * for EVERY object view, declared or not.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT MAKES THIS ONE DIFFERENT, and why it still had to go. For calendar
 * and gantt the fabrication produced a WRONG SCREEN — records piled onto
 * today's cell, a chart drawn on names nobody wrote. Gallery does not:
 * `ObjectGallery` resolves the cover per record and collapses the cover area
 * when no record yields one, so the invented `'image'` degraded to a gallery of
 * coverless cards. The defect is one layer up, in the GATE.
 * `ListView.availableViews` asks `schema.options?.gallery?.imageField`, and a
 * key this file always supplied made that check answer YES for every object
 * view whitelisting `gallery` — so ADR-0047's whitelist ∩ resolvable, the
 * mechanism that exists to stop a visualization being offered with nothing
 * behind it, was answering about a name this face wrote. Gallery was offered
 * without a block and looked fine only because the renderer degrades politely.
 * A coincidence, not a design.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE PREMISE WAS MEASURED BEFORE THE DELETION — the discipline objectui#7070
 * wrote down. #7029's mechanic is only correct where the read site's own answer
 * is honest. `ObjectGallery` keeps its own `coverField … ?? 'image'` rung, and
 * that is CORRECT there: it is the component's decision about an unconfigured
 * record, and it is honest because the cover area collapses when the guess
 * yields nothing (`ObjectGallery.tsx`, the `anyItemHasCover` memo). What this
 * face must not do is pre-empt that decision and light the capability gate on
 * the way past.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted before running, then observed:
 * restore `imageField: viewDef.gallery?.imageField || viewDef.gallery?.coverField
 * || 'image'` and the "invents NO cover field" cases below go RED (they read the
 * fabricated name) while every declared-config CONTROL stays GREEN in either
 * world — the fabricated value is only ever observable when the view declared
 * nothing. That asymmetry is the point: a fix that emitted an empty config for
 * EVERY view would also pass an absence-only test.
