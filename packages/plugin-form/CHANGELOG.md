## 17.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 9c74902: Retire the form-view section `className` / `gridClassName` reads (objectstack#13626,
  maintainer ruling 2026-09-01, director decision batch C).
  
  **Breaking, deliberately.** A `className` or `gridClassName` authored on a form-view
  section no longer has any effect. Before this change an authored `gridClassName`
  reached the section's field-grid `<div>` and an authored `className` reached the
  section wrapper / divider header; both are now dropped at the renderer.
  
  The two keys sit on the SDUI-only side of the authorable boundary: `@objectstack/spec`
  deliberately does not declare either on the form-view/section surface (its
  `component.zod.ts` says so in as many words) and the authorable-surface ledger carries
  no entry for them. The renderer nevertheless reached them off the parsed view through
  `as any` at seven sites — the boundary declared on one side and crossed on the other,
  with the two repos each deliberate and in opposite directions.
  
  Declaring the keys instead was weighed and **not** adopted: it would formally invite
  free Tailwind strings into authored metadata, the exact class the boundary exists to
  keep out — and per ADR-0065 / ADR-0080 (rev. 2026-06-30) utility classNames in runtime
  metadata are never scanned by the build-time Tailwind, so they silently produce no CSS
  anyway. Declaring them would have published a styling surface whose most obvious use
  does nothing. If per-view styling becomes a real product need it gets an explicit
  controlled token surface, not two leaked keys.
  
  **Migration.** Nothing in the measured corpora has to change. A census across the
  objectstack corpus, this repo's corpus, and the hotcrm application found **zero**
  authored uses of either key on a form-view section (201 authored section nodes reached,
  0 carrying either key). If you author them in your own metadata, move the styling to
  the host application's own CSS, or to the form ROOT `className` — which is a different
  key on a different node and is **unaffected** by this change.
  
  Six sites in `ObjectForm` (the tabbed / wizard / split / drawer / modal section maps and
  the stacked section-divider) and one in `DrawerForm` (its own divider) stop copying the
  keys. The omission is pinned behaviourally across all seven arms rather than by a source
  grep, because `ObjectFormSection` still declares both keys — so a later uncast
  `className: s.className` would type-check and silently restore consumption.
- 636b236: `navigateOnSuccess` is relative-only, escapes the interpolated id, and is deprecated in favour of `submitBehavior`
  
  The url contract for this key was undeclared: it was same-origin-guarded (so a same-origin
  ABSOLUTE value was accepted), it interpolated `{id}` / `{recordId}` without escaping the
  substituted value, and nothing said which of those was intended. The maintainer ruled it on
  2026-08-17: `navigateOnSuccess` is the pre-ruling ancestor of the `submitBehavior` family
  rather than a second dialect, so as a compat alias it runs under the semantics
  objectstack#7496 ruled for that family.
  
  **Relative paths only.** A same-origin absolute such as `https://own-host/record/{id}` is
  now refused like any other out-of-contract value, rather than accepted and navigated at
  browser level. The destination is authored metadata, which is exactly where an address
  somebody else chose gets copied in. Cross-origin and protocol-relative values were already
  refused and still are; every relative shape that worked before still works.
  
  **The interpolated id is URL-escaped.** `/r/{id}` with an id of `a/b c` resolved to
  `/r/a/b c`, silently growing a path segment, and a template of `{id}` let the id become the
  whole destination. The substituted value now goes through `encodeURIComponent`, so a token
  is a value in the path and never a way to add path structure. The template is the author's
  and is untouched — only the id, which is data read off the written record, is escaped.
  
  Both halves are needed and neither implies the other: relative-only is a rule about where a
  destination starts, so it cannot see structure injected further along; escaping runs only on
  the substituted value, so it cannot see an absolute the author wrote out.
  
  This can only narrow what is reachable. Every destination the key now accepts is a relative
  reference, and a relative reference cannot carry an authority, so it was already accepted by
  the same-origin guard this replaces — no value that was refused is now followed. With every
  accepted destination relative, the browser-level `window.location.assign` fallback at both
  call sites became unreachable and was removed; an accepted destination goes to the injected
  navigation seam, and the absent-seam fallback inside the shared hook is unchanged.
  
  **Deprecation.** `navigateOnSuccess` is marked `@deprecated` in favour of `submitBehavior`,
  which already takes precedence over it and carries the richer `{{record.field_name}}`
  interpolation. The `{id}` / `{recordId}` dialect keeps working for forms that already
  declare it — the ruling converges the documentation and the semantics, not the spelling.
- 7a72422: Publish the create-payload rule from `@object-ui/plugin-form`'s entry, so a
  second form renderer can call it instead of composing it by hand
  (objectui#6059).
  
  Newly importable from `@object-ui/plugin-form` — two functions, nothing else:
  
  ```typescript
  import { omitServerResolvedDefaults, isRequiredInForm } from '@object-ui/plugin-form';
  ```
  
  - `omitServerResolvedDefaults(values, objectSchema)` — drop the keys a CREATE
    payload must leave to the producer: a field whose declared `defaultValue` is a
    runtime instruction (`NOW()` / `current_user`, or a CEL envelope) and whose
    submitted value is empty. `ObjectQL.applyFieldDefaults` resolves a declaration
    only for a field that arrives absent or null, so submitting a blank stores
    `''` and silently defeats it. **Create-only** — the caller keeps the mode gate.
  - `isRequiredInForm(field, isCreateForm)` — the `required` a form should
    enforce, given the mode. Published as the pair's other half on purpose:
    excusing a server-owned field from `required` and then submitting the key
    anyway is not half a fix, it is no fix.
  
  Both are pure functions over plain data (no React, no registry). The rest of
  `schemaDefaults.ts` — `seedCreateValues`, `schemaDefaultValues`,
  `isSeedableDefault`, `isCreateFormMode`, `SeedContext` — stays module-private,
  and `isRuntimeDefault` stays `@object-ui/core`'s to publish.
  
  No behaviour change. The console's `FormPage` now calls the published helper
  instead of composing `isRuntimeDefault` + `isMissingForRequired` locally; its
  create payload is decided identically before and after, pinned against the
  deleted implementation over the full matrix of default shapes, value spellings
  and both modes.
- 5173a5e: ⚠️ **Behaviour change: `current_user` predicates that have been doing nothing on
  the console form routes and in the wizard's submit gate now TAKE EFFECT.** Read
  this before upgrading if any of your form metadata gates on the session user.
  
  objectui#6010 bound the host predicate scope on the five authored-predicate call
  sites in the components form renderer, so `current_user` (plus the ADR-0068
  `user` / `ctx.user` / `os.user` aliases) resolves on `visibleWhen` / `visibleOn`
  there. Two other authored-predicate evaluators were still passing `undefined`
  for that argument, so the same authored text meant two different things
  depending on which surface opened the form (objectui#6110):
  
  - **`apps/console`'s form renderer**, on the authed internal route
    `/forms/:name`. The internal route is a runtime record surface by ADR-0089
    D1's own words (*"runtime record surfaces bind `record` + `current_user`"*),
    and its `visibleWhen` metadata is the same `*.view.ts` FormView the
    object-view chain renders — so a role gate authored once behaved differently
    depending on which route opened the form.
  - **`WizardForm`'s submit-time required re-check** (`missingRequiredByStep`),
    the gate that re-checks the whole declared field set at final submit because
    `allowSkip` can jump past a step. Its docstring promises *"the same verdict
    from all three rather than a second, divergent dialect"*, and since #6010 it
    was the divergent one.
  
  **Why nobody noticed, and why the fix is felt as a change.** `visibleWhen` fails
  OPEN: a field on screen is what you get when the predicate resolves TRUE, when
  the scope was never bound so the predicate faulted, *and* when the predicate is
  broken. Those worlds were indistinguishable, so an app that authored a
  `current_user` gate saw the field render and had no way to tell the rule was
  inert. After this change the predicate is evaluated for real, and fields and
  sections that have always been visible will disappear for the users the rule
  excludes. `requiredWhen` fails the other way (CLOSED), so a `current_user`
  requiredWhen that has been silently not applying will now start holding submits.
  
  In the wizard the change is a fix in the user's favour as well: a required field
  the wizard HID from this user was still counted as visible by the submit gate,
  so the submit was refused on a control the submitter could neither see nor fill
  in.
  
  **Before upgrading**, audit any `visibleWhen` / `visibleOn` / `requiredWhen` in
  your form-view and object metadata that names `current_user`, and confirm each
  predicate says what you actually want evaluated against `record` +
  `current_user`.
  
  **The public anonymous form `/f/:slug` is deliberately unchanged.** It is
  mounted outside `ProtectedRoute` so an anonymous visitor can submit it, there is
  no authenticated principal, and no provider is mounted above it — so its scope
  is empty and a `current_user` predicate authored on a public form still faults
  and still fails open, exactly as before. Nothing new is declared to say so: the
  two routes are told apart by which component mounts them.
  
  `@object-ui/app-shell` exports `buildExpressionUser`, the `ExpressionProvider`
  user normalisation, so every console surface that mounts the provider publishes
  the same `current_user` shape rather than re-deriving it.
- 971d387: ⚠️ **Behaviour change: an authored `FormSection.visibleWhen` that has been doing nothing
  will now START HIDING SECTIONS.** Read this before upgrading if any of your metadata
  authors a section predicate.
  
  `@objectstack/spec` declares `FormSection.visibleWhen` and this repo's spec bridge maps it
  through, but every plugin-form layout renders a section header as a virtual
  `section-divider` pseudo-field and none of them copied the predicate onto it. On the
  object-view chain — the create/edit modal, the drawer, the split form, and the full-page
  record form — the key was declared, mapped, carried, and then dropped one hop before
  anything could evaluate it. The section rendered unconditionally, with no diagnostic
  (objectui#6111).
  
  **Why nobody noticed, and why the fix is felt as a regression.** `visibleWhen` fails OPEN:
  a section that renders is what you get when the predicate resolves TRUE, when the predicate
  never arrives, *and* when the predicate faults. Those three worlds were indistinguishable,
  so an app that authored a section predicate saw its section render and had no way to tell
  that the rule was inert. Every such app has been running with the rule switched off, and
  some will have been authored — or simply grown used to — that state. After this change the
  predicate is evaluated for real, and sections that have always been visible will disappear
  for the users the rule excludes.
  
  This is the intended ADR-0089 contract being delivered, not a new capability: the key was
  already declared, already documented, and already honoured by the console form renderer.
  The object-view chain was the one that silently ignored it.
  
  **Before upgrading**, audit any `sections[].visibleWhen` in your form-view metadata and
  confirm each predicate says what you actually want, evaluated against `record` +
  `current_user`. A predicate that was written speculatively, or left behind after a rework,
  now takes effect.
  
  **Measured scope of the hide.** The predicate gates the section's HEADER row. The renderer
  treats `section-divider` as presentational and holds no association between it and the
  fields that follow it, so a false predicate removes the heading and the section's fields
  keep rendering. The console renderer (`apps/console`) drops the whole `<section>`, fields
  included. That divergence is real, is pinned honestly by this change's tests rather than
  implied away, and is filed separately — it needs a renderer-side grouping contract, not
  another line in a layout.
  
  Two hops were dropping the key and both are repaired: `ObjectForm` rebuilds each section
  key by key when it delegates to Split/Drawer/Modal (and `ModalForm`'s own `groups` map does
  it again), so a key those maps did not copy never reached the layout at all; and the six
  `section-divider` synthesis sites across the four layout files.
  
  `@object-ui/types` gains the matching `ObjectFormSection.visibleWhen` declaration.
- 5ef9c4f: The section grouping contract (objectui#6236, maintainer ruling 2026-08-27): a
  `section-divider` row may now CLAIM its member fields — `FormField.fields: string[]`, the
  same membership shape `FormFieldTab.fields` / `FormFieldPane.fields` already model — and
  the form renderer then gates the WHOLE group on the divider's own visibility verdict
  (`visibleWhen` / `visibleOn` / legacy `condition`).
  
  Before this, one authored `FormSection.visibleWhen` meant two different things: the
  console renderer drops the whole `<section>` (heading and fields), while the plugin-form
  chain's renderer treated `section-divider` as a purely presentational row and hid only
  the HEADING, leaving the section's fields rendering (measured in objectui#6111, which
  pinned that honestly rather than implying a guarantee it did not deliver).
  
  Ruled semantics, now pinned in `section-grouping-6236.test.tsx`:
  
  - **Visibility decides what is DRAWN and nothing else** (console precedent, 2026-08-22
    ruling after #5594) — a hidden section's values still submit.
  - **A hidden section's fields skip client-side validation** — a user is never blocked by
    an error pointing at a control they cannot see (the objectui#6110 defect shape); the
    server-side contract remains the loud floor for genuinely-required data. A section
    hiding mid-session also clears its members' stale errors, the way a field's own false
    predicate already did.
  - **A divider without a claim keeps the old contract** (its predicate gates only the
    heading), so existing schemas are untouched.
  
  Both halves ride the mechanism the field-level predicate already uses (return `null`;
  react-hook-form keeps the value and skips the unmounted control), so field-level and
  section-level visibility cannot drift apart. The zod mirror (`FormFieldSchema`) declares
  the key with the same scope note.
  
  `@object-ui/plugin-form` wires the producer half: all six `section-divider` synthesis
  sites (ObjectForm's stacked simple path, ModalForm's sectioned and derived-fieldGroup
  paths, DrawerForm's sectioned and derived-fieldGroup paths, SplitForm's panes) now stamp
  the membership claim onto the divider they emit, from the RESOLVED member list — so an
  authored `FormSection.visibleWhen` finally hides the whole section on the object-view
  chain, matching the console renderer. The #6111 honest pin (`measured scope`) flipped
  accordingly: it now pins heading-and-fields hiding together, and every per-layout DENIED
  row asserts the claimed member as well as the heading. The derived-fieldGroup sites carry
  the claim for uniformity but stay fail-open — the spec `fieldGroups` vocabulary has no
  section-predicate slot to author. The tabbed arm's predicate slot (objectui#6237) is
  designed to reuse this same grouping contract.
- 46f0bb4: The tabbed arm of the grouping contract (objectui#6237, same maintainer ruling as
  objectui#6236): `FormFieldTab` gains the predicate slot the ruling named —
  `visibleWhen?: string | { dialect?: string; source: string }` — so a section rendered as
  a TAB PANEL (`ModalForm` `contentLayout: 'tabbed'`) can finally carry an authored
  `FormSection.visibleWhen`. The tabbed layout synthesises no `section-divider` at all, so
  the #6236 membership-claim mechanism had nothing to stamp the predicate onto and no slot
  to copy it into; the predicate was silently dropped one hop before evaluation (measured
  in objectui#6237's card).
  
  The form renderer evaluates the tab's predicate with the same record assembly the
  field-level rules use (`ruleRecord` / `previousRecord` / host predicate scope, #6010),
  fail-open, and when FALSE draws neither the tab's trigger nor its panel. Not drawing the
  panel unmounts the claimed fields through the exact mechanism a field's own false
  predicate uses, so the ruled hidden-group semantics are inherited rather than
  re-implemented, and are pinned in `fieldtab-visiblewhen-6237.test.tsx`:
  
  - **Visibility decides what is DRAWN and nothing else** — a hidden tab's values still
    submit.
  - **A hidden tab's fields skip client-side validation** — a user is never blocked by an
    error pointing at a control they cannot see; the server-side contract remains the loud
    floor for genuinely-required data (#2959's trap, answered the same way for tabs as for
    sections). A tab hiding mid-session clears its members' stale errors.
  - **Deterministic re-selection**: a predicate hiding the ACTIVE tab activates the user's
    pick if still visible, else the declared default, else the first visible tab — never an
    empty panel — and the user's pick is restored the moment its tab is re-admitted.
  - **No mid-interaction collapse**: whether the tabbed arm engages stays judged on the
    DECLARED tabs, so a predicate hiding one of two tabs filters the strip (and hides the
    tab's fields) instead of collapsing the modal into the stacked layout under the user's
    cursor. With every tab hidden the strip is omitted; unclaimed fields still render.
  - **A tab without the key keeps the pre-#6237 contract** (always drawn), so existing
    schemas are untouched.
  
  `@object-ui/plugin-form` wires the producer half: `ModalForm`'s tabbed synthesis site now
  copies the section's `visibleWhen` onto the tab it emits, and the #6111 layout matrix
  gains the tabbed-modal rows (direct and via `ObjectForm` delegation). `TabbedForm` /
  `WizardForm` still declare no section predicate in their own section configs — those arms
  remain open on objectui#6237.
- 2da6441: `formType: 'tabbed'` now honours an authored section `visibleWhen` (objectui#6237).
  
  The tabbed arm of the one grouping contract ruled 2026-08-29 (option A). Before
  this, an authored `FormSection.visibleWhen` was dropped on the tabbed route
  while `split` / `drawer` / `modal` and the flat layout all honoured it — the key
  never reached a renderer at all, so it did nothing.
  
  `TabbedForm` already synthesised the renderer's `fieldTabs`, which is the same
  machinery the `modal` + `contentLayout: 'tabbed'` arm runs on. The predicate was
  simply dropped at three points on the way there, and all three now carry it:
  `ObjectForm`'s tabbed section map, `FormSectionConfig` (which declared no such
  key), and `TabbedForm`'s `fieldTabs` synthesis.
  
  Because the arm reaches the existing evaluator, the three ruled semantics are
  inherited rather than re-implemented beside it: a hidden tab's values still
  submit, its fields skip client-side validation (so a required field on a hidden
  tab cannot block a submit invisibly — objectui#2959's defect through a new
  door), a predicate hiding the ACTIVE tab re-selects deterministically instead of
  drawing an empty panel, and arm engagement stays structural on the DECLARED
  tabs so a predicate cannot collapse the strip mid-interaction.
  
  Two boundaries are deliberate:
  
  - A single-section tabbed form never engages the tab arm, so it degrades to the
    untabbed layout's own predicate mechanism — a chrome-less `section-divider`
    claiming its members by name. Existing single-section forms are unchanged; the
    gate is emitted only where a predicate was actually authored.
  - Wizard STEPS still do not take a predicate, and now say so in the type:
    `WizardStepConfig` omits the key, because a step predicate is a different
    contract (step-boundary reactive against the ruled live-record reactivity, and
    needing navigation and final-gate semantics none of this machinery supplies).
    `ObjectForm` continues to report that gap at runtime for untyped JSON.
- 2d3fe73: Publish the parameter types of the entry's own exported functions, so a consumer can
  name what it must pass (objectui#7324).
  
  `ChildObjectSchemaLike` and `FieldDefaultsSchemaLike` are now exported from
  `@object-ui/plugin-form`. They are **type-only** additions — no runtime name is added
  to the entry, which is pinned.
  
  **Why `minor`, not `patch`.** Nothing breaks and no behaviour changes, but two names
  join the published surface of a published package. Additions are `minor` in this repo,
  and a new public export is the kind of addition a consumer's lockfile-pinned range
  should be able to see.
  
  **What was wrong.** Five exported derive functions (`deriveDetail`, `deriveColumns`,
  `deriveFormFields`, `findRelationshipField`, `resolveInlineMode`) take a `childSchema`,
  and the exported `omitServerResolvedDefaults` takes an `objectSchema` — and neither
  parameter type reached the entry. A host with its own form renderer (the reason
  objectui#6059 published `omitServerResolvedDefaults` in the first place) has to hold
  that schema in a variable or a prop, and could not annotate it. Structural typing means
  such a host still compiled by writing the shape out by hand, so the cost was not a hard
  failure but a producer-owned shape restated in every consumer, invisible to every gate
  until the producer's shape moved. The package README carried exactly that restatement,
  and now imports the real name instead.
  
  **Renamed at the declaration site first, deliberately.** Both types were called
  `ObjectSchemaLike`, in two files, and they are **not** the same type: the defaults one
  pins the four field members its rule reads (`defaultValue`, `type`, `reference`,
  `reference_to`), while the child one leaves a field value as `any` because the derive
  functions read much more of it. Measured with `tsc`, they are mutually assignable
  **only** through that `any` — replace it with `unknown` and the child → defaults
  direction fails (TS2322) — so re-exporting either under the shared name would have put
  a name on the public surface that already meant something else two files over, with
  nothing in the name to say which. Neither old name was reachable from outside the
  package (the package `exports` map has a single `.` entry and the entry never re-exported
  them), so the rename is not a break for any consumer.
  
  **Not** `@object-ui/types`' `ObjectSchemaMetadata`: measured, it requires `name`,
  requires a `type` on every field, and has no `reference_to` member — while
  `isCurrentUserSeedField` honours both `reference` and `reference_to` on purpose. Adopting
  it would have narrowed what these functions accept and dropped one of the two honoured
  spellings, not widened anything.
- 3c9fca3: Create forms pre-fill the `current_user` defaultValue token with the acting user (#5683). `PermissionContextValue` gains `userId` (from `/me/permissions`; `null` = unknown), and the create-form seeding resolves `defaultValue: 'current_user'` on `user` / `lookup→sys_user` fields to that id — the same value the engine stamps at insert, so the pre-fill is a preview of the server's own resolution, not a second default contract. Unknown user (no provider / anonymous / role-based provider) seeds nothing and keeps the omit-and-let-the-engine-resolve behavior. `NOW()` and CEL defaults stay server-owned.
- ebce5a3: `object-grid` / `object-form` / `detail-view` resolve their data source the same way, and a block that resolves none says so
  
  The three object-bound blocks disagreed about how the data-source adapter reached
  them. `object-grid` and `object-form` were registered through wrappers that read
  it from `SchemaRendererProvider` context; `detail-view` was registered as the raw
  component, which reads a React `dataSource` prop. `SchemaRenderer` itself reads
  only context, so the two wirings were mutually exclusive: measured with correct
  keys in every cell, provider wiring gave the grid `find` 1 and the detail view
  `findOne` 0, and prop wiring gave exactly the reverse. Neither reported anything.
  
  All three now resolve the adapter through one rule — an explicit `dataSource`
  prop first, the provider context second. This is additive: `detail-view` keeps
  its prop form (and direct `<DetailView dataSource={…} />` callers are untouched),
  `object-form` gains a prop form it did not have, and `object-grid` no longer
  throws `useSchemaContext must be used within a SchemaRendererProvider` when a
  page has no provider.
  
  And the silence is over. A block in this family that resolves no adapter renders
  a **No data source resolved** panel naming the block, the object it was about to
  read, and the ancestor that injects the adapter — instead of a header-only grid,
  a field-less form card, or nothing at all. The check is opt-in per block, so a
  placement with inline rows, inline `customFields`, an inline record or an `api`
  endpoint is untouched.
  
  New from `@object-ui/react`: `useResolvedDataSource`, `NoDataSourcePanel`,
  `noDataSourceMessage`, and a `requiresDataSource` prop on `ElementDataSourceGate`.

### Patch Changes

- 39f4309: Published typings from every `vite-plugin-dts` package now carry an explicit extension on
  every relative specifier, and a type error in the declaration build now fails the build
  instead of being printed and ignored (objectui#5439, objectui#5483).
  
  **Consumers on `moduleResolution: nodenext` or `node16` may see NEW type errors, and that
  is the fix working.** These packages re-export mostly through NAMED re-exports —
  `export { useObjectChat } from './useObjectChat'`. TypeScript could not follow the
  extensionless hop, but it still DECLARED the name, so the symbol resolved to a silent
  `any`. Nothing errored; consumers simply got no types. With the extension emitted, the
  symbol carries its real type, and any call site that was relying on the `any` now type
  checks for the first time. This is the mode that produced the 21 residual `TS7006` on
  `@object-ui/app-shell` reported against objectui#5365 — a type hole that opened quietly,
  unlike objectui#5365's own `export * from './ui'` packages where the same defect surfaced
  immediately as `TS2305: has no exported member`.
  
  410 extensionless relative specifiers across 19 packages were emitted before this change;
  the count is now 0 in all 22 packages that build typings through `vite-plugin-dts`.
  `@object-ui/fields` was already clean — its sources write explicit `.js` specifiers — and
  is wired so it stays that way.
  
  The second half changes no emitted output today: 22/22 packages built green unmodified, so
  making the declaration step's exit code honest turns nothing red. It changes what a FUTURE
  regression does — print and exit 0, versus fail the build.
- 3e853c9: Let a producer-marked refusal reach the drag-write surfaces (objectui#5902).
  
  The kanban card-move toast, the calendar drag-to-reschedule toast and the OCC
  conflict dialog each substituted a generic string for a refusal the producer had
  marked as user-facing (`userMessage`), so a user was told "Save failed" where the
  application author had written a sentence addressed to them. All three now read
  the marking through the shared `declaredUserMessage` reader, which covers both
  places the adapter boundary parks it — the typed member on
  `ConcurrentUpdateError` and the details bag on `DataApiValidationError`.
  
  Nothing unmarked changes: the reader answers `null` for it, so every existing
  generic substitution — including the localized "not authorized" message that
  keeps raw server diagnostics away from end users — still governs unmarked
  refusals exactly as before.
  
  The two toasts substitute; the conflict dialog augments. Its description also
  explains what the destructive "Overwrite" button does, which is affordance copy
  that surface owns rather than a refusal message, so the marking leads and that
  paragraph stays.
- 17ccec9: `object-master-detail-form` declines to fetch a detail collection whose child object it never resolved, instead of calling `getObjectSchema(undefined)`.
  
  `childObject` is REQUIRED on `MasterDetailDetailConfig` and is what every downstream read is keyed
  on — `deriveDetail(d.childObject, …)`, the child-schema cache, and the FK scope of each child
  fetch. But a detail entry reaches the renderer straight off an authored schema, so a malformed one
  arrives with the key `undefined`, and the resolve effect asked the data layer for it anyway.
  Measured: mounting the block with a detail entry that carries no `childObject` issued
  `getObjectSchema(undefined)` — a real backend receives a query for an object literally named
  `undefined`, and whatever it returns becomes the console's problem.
  
  The resolve effect now skips such an entry and warns, leaving it in place so the grid card shows
  its config hint and the row-state array stays index-matched. This is the choice `RelatedList`
  already makes for the same class of missing key (*"has no referenceField/parentId — refusing to
  fetch all rows"*), and the sibling child-schema-cache effect in this same component already spelled
  it `.filter(Boolean)`; the three now agree. A detail collection that names its child object fetches
  exactly as before.
- c9a7252: `record:line_items` declines to fetch the child schema of a panel whose child object it never resolved, instead of calling `getObjectSchema(undefined)`.
  
  `childObject` is declared `required: true` on the block's registry entry and typed `string` on
  `LineItemsPanelSchema`, but nothing enforces either — `inputs[].required` is designer metadata, and
  the block has no spec schema — so a node reaches the renderer straight off an authored schema with
  the key `undefined`, and the child-schema effect asked the data layer for it anyway. Measured:
  mounting the block through the registry with `childObject` unset issued
  `getObjectSchema(undefined)`, and a real backend receives a query for an object literally named
  `undefined`. The effect's `.catch` then turned the answer into a null child schema, so the visible
  outcome was a silently unsanitized child grid rather than an error.
  
  The effect now declines and warns, naming the key and what to set it to, and clears the cached child
  schema so a later save is never sanitized against a previous object's fields. This is the choice
  `RelatedList` already makes for the same class of missing key (*"has no referenceField/parentId —
  refusing to fetch all rows"*), and the one `object-master-detail-form` makes on this exact key. A
  panel that names its child object fetches exactly as before.
- 5f19b92: `record:line_items` declines to LOAD OR WRITE the rows of a panel whose child object it never resolved, instead of calling `find(undefined, …)` — the sibling site of the child-schema decline, in the same component.
  
  `LineItemsPanel` read `schema.childObject` at two sites. The first now declines; the row load still
  asked the data layer to `find` an object literally named `undefined`, scoped by
  `{ [relationshipField]: parentId }`. `load` guarded the *data source* and the *parent id* — the two
  things `RelatedList` calls "can I scope this query" — but not the *object being queried*.
  
  Declining that fetch is not enough on its own, and this is the part worth reading: `load` owns
  `loading`, and the panel branched `loading ? "Loading…" : !parentId ? "Save the record first…" :
  <grid>`. So the moment the fetch declined, an unresolvable panel with a parent id bound fell to the
  third branch and showed an **empty editable grid with an Add button, over an object that does not
  exist** — a worse outcome than the fetch it replaced. Measured on the pre-fix component: one
  keystroke in the grid's always-present ghost row materialised a row, which enabled Save, which
  reached `batchTransaction([{ object: undefined, action: 'create', data: { qty: 3, invoice: 'inv-1' } }])`.
  The bad *read* was one keystroke away from a bad *write*.
  
  An unresolvable panel therefore gets its own render branch — a config hint naming `childObject` and
  what to set it to, following the precedent `object-master-detail-form` set for this exact key and
  `AdvancedChartImpl`'s refusal placeholders. It is checked ahead of `loading`, because nothing is
  pending: the schema itself already says the panel can never resolve, so there is no honest moment at
  which "Loading…" is true. `save` takes the same one-line guard, for the one route the render branch
  cannot close — a schema edited to drop `childObject` while rows are already dirty.
  
  A panel that names its child object loads, renders and saves exactly as before.
- e0b289d: An authored section `visibleWhen` on `formType: 'tabbed'` or `formType: 'wizard'` now
  **reports** that the layout cannot honour it, instead of being silently dropped
  (objectui#6237).
  
  `ObjectForm` rebuilds each section key by key when it delegates to a layout, so a key
  the map does not copy never reaches a renderer at all. Three of those maps copy
  `visibleWhen` (`split` / `drawer` / `modal`, objectui#6111) and the flat arm carries it
  on the `section-divider` pseudo-field — but the `tabbed` and `wizard` maps copy nothing,
  so an author writing the key on those two arms watched it do exactly nothing, with no
  signal anywhere. That silence is the defect this ships against.
  
  The two arms now log a warning naming the layout and the sections whose predicate is
  being dropped, through one shared message builder so they cannot drift apart.
  
  **This changes no rendering behaviour** — the predicate is still not evaluated on those
  arms. It is the interim half of a maintainer ruling (2026-08-29) that the real repair is
  a **design** task: one renderer-side section/group contract with a predicate slot,
  designed once for every layout arm (tabbed / TabbedForm / WizardForm / flat) rather than
  patched arm by arm. The ruling requires the diagnostic to land first, so the gap stops
  being invisible while that contract is designed.
  
  Deliberately silent on the arms that work, so the warning stays worth reading:
  
  - `split` / `drawer` / `modal`, and the flat layout — all honour a section `visibleWhen`.
  - `ModalForm` with `contentLayout: 'tabbed'` — honours it through the real
    `FormFieldTab.visibleWhen` slot that landed in objectui#6619. "Tabbed" names two
    different things on this card; only `formType: 'tabbed'` (`TabbedForm`) is inert.
  - A master-detail parent, which re-enters `ObjectForm` through its own parent schema —
    the report is left to that inner pass, where the real layout is decided (a
    master-detail `wizard` parent renders `simple`, which honours the key). Reporting at
    both would double-report the tabbed parent and false-report the wizard one.
  
  No authorable key is added anywhere: declaring `visibleWhen` on a type whose renderer
  ignores it is the defect this card family exists to close, and the shared
  `FormSectionConfig` that `WizardForm` uses for its steps makes that trap concrete.
- 3b9c774: Split `WizardStepConfig` off `FormSectionConfig`, and correct the section-predicate
  support table (objectui#6237, maintainer ruling 2026-08-30).
  
  `WizardForm` typed its steps as `Omit<FormSectionConfig, 'visibleWhen'>` — a
  subtraction from the TabbedForm section type, which is the predicate-CARRYING
  type. That defended the one key it named and left the mechanism open: every key
  added to `FormSectionConfig` reached a wizard step by default, so the next
  predicate in the same family (`readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen`, already this
  package's field-level vocabulary) would have handed the wizard a silent slot its
  renderer does not read — the declared-but-unenforced shape the ruling split the
  types to stop.
  
  `WizardStepConfig` is now declared independently in `WizardForm.tsx`, which is
  simply what `SplitFormSectionConfig`, `ModalFormSectionConfig` and
  `DrawerFormSectionConfig` already do: each layout owns its group shape, documents
  `className` / `gridClassName` in its own terms, and declares `visibleWhen` only
  where its renderer honours it. The derivation flips from subtractive to additive
  — a key is authorable on a wizard step only if someone writes it there.
  
  No behaviour change and no key added or removed: `WizardStepConfig` exports the
  same key set it already had, and `visibleWhen` on a wizard step literal was, and
  remains, a compile error. What is new is that it stays one for the whole
  predicate family, pinned by a type-level assertion that fails the build if any
  `*When` key ever appears on the step type.
  
  Documentation repair in the same stroke: the support table in the README and in
  `content/docs/plugins/plugin-form.mdx` still said `formType: 'tabbed'` sections
  drop the predicate. That stopped being true when the tabbed arm landed — the row
  now reads **Yes**, the surrounding prose no longer claims two inert arms or a
  diagnostic that fires for `tabbed`, and the wizard row stays **No**, which is
  still exactly true.
- 1c19722: `object-master-detail-form` now renders a config hint naming `childObject` for a detail
  collection whose child object never resolved, instead of `Loading columns…` forever
  (objectui#6360).
  
  `MasterDetailForm` already declines to fetch the schema of such a detail (objectui#5940)
  and returns the entry unresolved, which is correct — asking the data layer for an object
  literally named `undefined` is what that guard removed. But the decline is precisely the
  guarantee that the entry's columns can never arrive, and the render branch it fell into
  read `!d.columns?.length ? <p>Loading columns…</p>`. The author was shown a
  spinner-shaped message that was permanently, unfixably wrong, and that never named the
  key they had to set.
  
  The `!d.childObject` case now takes its own branch, checked **before** the columns arm
  because nothing is pending — there is no first paint where "loading" is honest. The copy
  and structure are `LineItemsPanel`'s, which took the same branch for the same key in
  objectui#6194 / PR #6359; the two components had been disagreeing about what an author
  sees for the identical authoring mistake, and the weaker of the two was the one that read
  as the precedent. The hint carries its own `data-testid` (`md-detail-no-child-object`).
  
  Two source comments — at the decline itself and at the resolver's `catch` — asserted that
  "the grid card shows a config hint". They were false, and following them cost a reader a
  run of the component. The first is now true and says so. The second is **corrected rather
  than made true**: a detail whose schema fetch *threw* does name a child object, so it
  skips the new branch and still lands on `Loading columns…`. Distinguishing that from
  "still in flight" needs per-entry error state the resolver does not keep, so it is filed
  as objectui#6372 and the comment now points at it instead of promising a hint that is not
  rendered there.
  
  No spec or schema change: `childObject` is already REQUIRED on `MasterDetailDetailConfig`.
  This is renderer-side reporting of an authoring error that the type system cannot catch,
  because a detail entry reaches this renderer straight off an authored JSON schema.
- faa863d: `MasterDetailForm` gives every detail collection a per-entry record carrying its own
  identity and its own resolution status, closing two defects that both came from the same
  absence (objectui#6372, objectui#6371).
  
  `resolvedDetails` was a plain `MasterDetailDetailConfig[]` with no per-entry metadata, so
  both *what happened to this entry* and *which entry is this* were inferred from the
  entry's position in the array. One record answers both, which is why they land together —
  either one alone would have reshaped this structure and the second would then have
  rewritten the first.
  
  **objectui#6372 — a detail whose schema fetch threw sat on "Loading columns…" forever.**
  The resolver's `catch` returned the entry unchanged, and an entry with no `columns` is how
  *still in flight* is represented too, so the two states were indistinguishable and the
  render branch showed the same spinner-shaped message for both. For the failed one it never
  ended: the fetch is not retried, so nothing could ever replace it. Entries now carry a
  resolution status, and a failed one renders a refusal placeholder naming the child object
  whose schema could not be loaded (shaped on `AdvancedChartImpl`'s refusal placeholders —
  `role="status"`, because a refusal is a state, not an alert). Measured before the fix
  rather than read from source: a detail whose `getObjectSchema` rejects rendered
  `<p>Loading columns…</p>`.
  
  The thrown error is no longer discarded. The bare `catch` threw away the whole diagnosis,
  so whoever debugged this had neither a message nor a stack; the decline arm next to it has
  warned since objectui#5940, and this arm now matches it and passes the error object
  through.
  
  ⭐ The fetch and the derive are caught **separately**, because they are different failures
  with different truths to tell. A schema that loads fine and then yields no relationship
  field is a configuration error, and calling it a load failure would be false. That arm's
  render is deliberately unchanged; only its error stops being swallowed.
  
  **objectui#6371 — a declined entry had no identity across a reorder.** There was no
  duplicate-key collision: the map index is unique among siblings by construction, so two
  declined details keyed as `undefined-0` and `undefined-1`, distinct. The real defect is
  that for a declined entry the data half of that key is `undefined`, leaving position as
  the entry's whole identity — and the row-state store was addressed the same way, seeded
  once at mount and never re-synced when the authored config changed. Reordering or removing
  an entry therefore handed a collection a different collection's rows.
  
  Entries now carry an id synthesized once from the incoming config: the child object for a
  named collection, and the authored position for a declined one, which has no other
  identity to offer. Row state is keyed by that id, so a collection can only ever read its
  own slot. Three reads were affected, not the one the report named:
  
  - the grid value, which showed the wrong collection's rows;
  - the document **subtotal** reducer, so a reorder did not merely mis-associate a grid, it
    mis-computed the total;
  - the batch payload on save, which read
    `details.filter(d => d.relationshipField).map((d, i) => state[i])` — after the filter `i`
    indexed the filtered array while the row state was indexed against the full one, so a
    declined entry above a real collection shifted every read below it by one and that
    collection's rows were **silently dropped from the transaction**. Data loss on save, not
    a display defect.
- fd814d6: `MasterDetailForm` shows a config hint naming `relationshipField` for a detail collection
  whose child schema **loaded fine but could not be derived from**, instead of a permanent
  `Loading columns…` (objectui#6394).
  
  This is the third and last arm of the same resolver to be closed. `deriveDetail` throws
  when no lookup/`master_detail` field on the child object references the parent — a
  configuration error whose remedy is a key the author writes. The `catch` returned the
  entry unresolved, so it fell through to `!d.columns?.length ? <p>Loading columns…</p>`,
  and that message never ended: the derive is not retried, so those columns could never
  arrive. Same unbounded-wait-shown-as-a-spinner family as objectui#5940 / objectui#6188 /
  objectui#6194 / objectui#6360 / objectui#6372.
  
  The entry now carries `status: 'underivable'`, and the renderer gives it a branch of its
  own that names both ends of the relationship it could not find and the key to set:
  
  > Could not work out how `po_line` links to `purchase_order`: no lookup or master_detail
  > field on it references the parent. Set `relationshipField` on this collection to the
  > field that holds the parent record.
  
  ⛔ Deliberately **not** objectui#6372's refusal placeholder, which states the schema could
  not be loaded — false for a schema that loaded fine. The two failures keep separate copy
  because they have different remedies: one is "check the object exists and reload", this one
  is "set this key". The thrown error is still logged with its stack (objectui#6372), since
  the placeholder shows the author the key rather than the raw message.
  
  Behaviour is unchanged for the other two arms and for a detail that is genuinely still
  fetching — that one keeps `Loading columns…`, where the message is true.
- 3beef6d: The spec's `dataSource` element binding is now DECLARED by the blocks that read
  it, so the html tier stops reporting the one working saved-view spelling as
  `unknown-prop` (objectui#6678).
  
  `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` — `{ object, view, filter, sort, limit }` — is
  the one spelling that resolves a saved view for an object-bound block. It works,
  and it drew the identical `unknown-prop` warning as the two spellings that do
  nothing (`viewName`, `view`), because `validateTree` looks a prop up in the
  block's declared `inputs` and no registration declared this key. On the tier
  built to accept AI-authored pages, where the diagnostic IS the contract, the
  only signal pointed away from the key that works.
  
  Adopting the maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29 — option B **in the injection
  form**:
  
  - `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT` is the single declaration, in `@object-ui/core`
    beside the binding's own semantics; `Registry.register` emits it for any
    registration whose renderer passed through the new `elementDataSourceBlock()`
    seam. One mechanism, one copy — not a hand-kept declaration per block, which is
    the shape that drifts and that a new block forgets. The seam lives in
    `@object-ui/core` and is re-exported by `@object-ui/react` beside
    `ElementDataSourceGate` for discoverability; call sites take the core import,
    because a registration runs at module scope and this repo's suites partially
    mock `@object-ui/react`.
  - Seventeen renderers, in thirteen files across twelve packages, reach the seam
    and now publish the key to the save gate, the parser whitelist, the generated
    JSX authoring types and the block list. The card named nine blocks; the tree
    also has `plugin-grid`, `plugin-timeline`, two further `plugin-form` blocks and
    `element:record_picker` — nothing was hand-listed, so the mechanism covered
    them. `element:record_picker` consumes the gate's HOOK and status panels rather
    than the wrapper tag (its object lives under `properties`), and was found by a
    render probe rather than by reading sources.
  - `dataSource` on a block that does NOT read it (`flex`, `card`) still reports
    `unknown-prop`. Adding the key to `sdui-parser`'s `BASE_PROPS` was refused for
    exactly this reason — that set mirrors `BaseSchema`, and silencing the key
    everywhere would make the diagnostic lie in the other direction.
  - New `check:element-data-source-declaration` fails any source that consumes the
    gate without reaching the seam, so a block added tomorrow cannot forget.
  
  Behaviour of the binding itself is unchanged — this is a declaration, not a
  resolution change. The saved view still resolves its columns, and an
  unresolvable `view` still fails loudly rather than widening to the object's full
  scope.
  
  The spec/registry parity gates (repo-wide and the `record:related_list` per-block
  pin) now derive their accepted set from the WHOLE node contract rather than from
  `ComponentPropsMap[type]` alone. `PageComponentSchema` accepts and keeps
  `dataSource` on a page-component node — it is a node-level key, a sibling of
  `type` and `className`, not a per-block prop — so the gates' previous complaint
  was measurably wrong. Derived from the spec, not exempted, and both still
  discriminate against an invented key.
- ecd9cb2: Wizard view v1, the objectui half (Card R, objectui#6985) — alignment + pins for the
  ruled `type: 'wizard'` tightening (objectstack#13622 D1–D8, maintainer ruling
  2026-08-31; spec half objectstack PR #13733).
  
  The renderer was already aligned: `WizardStepConfig` carries no predicate/collapse
  keys (objectui#6237's ruled split), the wizard route drops-and-reports an authored
  step `visibleWhen`, and `allowSkip` has been navigation-freedom-not-validation-
  exemption since #2959. This card lands the residue:
  
  - **metadata-admin view create seeds one starter step for a wizard** (app-shell
    `anchors.ts`): the create body used to emit `sections: []` for every form type,
    which for `type: 'wizard'` is exactly the shape the tightened spec refuses at
    parse (D7 — a stepless wizard silently rendered as a plain simple form). Same
    seed-the-required-shape move the flow anchor makes for its `type` enum
    (objectui#2326). Other form types keep the bare `[]` — only the wizard variant
    refuses emptiness.
  - **`@object-ui/types` TSDoc states the ruled wizard boundary** where the shared
    section/form types restate the form-view family: `ObjectFormSection.visibleWhen`
    / `collapsible` / `collapsed` name the wizard drop + spec-door refusal;
    `ObjectFormSchema.sections` states sections-ARE-steps and array-order-is-step-
    order; `allowSkip` states the D4 semantics. Type SHAPES are unchanged — the
    spec's own ruled mechanism is a parse-time refinement over the single shared
    section schema (D2 option A), which these types mirror at the type level.
  - **Consumer-side behaviour pins** (`wizardRuledSemantics-6985.test.tsx`): the
    wizard-inert step keys are dropped, never honoured (a denying `visibleWhen`
    does not remove a step; `collapsible`/`collapsed: true` produce no collapse
    affordance, with a positive control on the affordance probe); the empty-steps
    wizard's measured degradation to a simple form is pinned as the shape the spec
    door now refuses (one-step wizards stay legal — no arity floor); array order
    is step order (with a reversed-array control).
  - **Installed-spec door pins** (`wizardSpecDoor-6985.test.ts`), gated on a
    capability probe of the installed `FormViewSchema` rather than a version
    string: the post-Card-S half (refusal messages, prescriptions, the authored-
    `false` collapse boundary, the wizard-scoped control) activates by itself on
    the lockfile bump that brings the tightening in; until then the pre-tightening
    half records the 17.2.x accept-set it measured. `steps:` is pinned refused on
    every spec line.
  
  No teaching material — the #13337/#13086 fence lifts only after both halves land;
  docs changes here are TSDoc/comments only.
- 7dedec6: A master-detail form no longer ends on a screen asserting both a failure and a success
  (objectui#7345).
  
  `MasterDetailForm` raised its two save outcomes — `handleSaved`'s confirmation and
  `handleError`'s refusal — under sonner's auto-generated ids, so nothing held a handle on
  the previous attempt's toast. A save the server refused left its error toast on screen,
  and when the user corrected the input and saved again inside that toast's lifetime the
  confirmation landed *beside* the refusal, exactly the objectui#7252 defect on a renderer
  that fix did not touch.
  
  Both outcomes now travel under one stable per-form id (`React.useId()`-scoped, the same
  spelling the form renderer and the console's `FormPage` publish under), and each save
  attempt retires the previous attempt's toast before it starts:
  
  - with no host `onSuccess` (SDUI / embedded hosts), the confirmation supersedes the
    refusal instead of stacking beside it;
  - with a host `onSuccess` (the console), where the built-in confirmation is deliberately
    skipped, the dismissal is what retires the refusal — otherwise it stood over a save
    that had succeeded.
  
  Toast durations are unchanged: this is about supersession, not lifetime.
- c6198c2: **Breaking for authored metadata:** `ComponentInput.label`, `ComponentInput.defaultValue` and
  `ComponentInput.advanced` are RETIRED on both faces (objectui#7493 item ① and objectui#7781;
  maintainer ruling A of 2026-09-06, immediate, no deprecation window; ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).
  They are the three keys the manifest serializer does not forward, and nothing read them on any
  publication or consumption path.
  
  No manifest ever published them, so no consumer could ever have read them. `sdui-parser`'s
  serializer (`packages/sdui-parser/src/index.ts`) forwards exactly six keys per input — `name`,
  `type`, `required`, `enum`, `binding`, `description` — so a value authored under any of the three
  never reached `sdui.manifest.json`, the generated JSX `.d.ts`, or a diagnostic; its boundary type
  has no slot for them; the registry's data-source seam reads `name` only; and neither the designer
  nor the app-shell inspectors consult registry `inputs` at all. A structural census over every
  `inputs:` array in the repository (re-measured on this change's merge-base, `name` 951 and `type`
  951 as the controls) counted the writes: `label` 908, `defaultValue` 245, `advanced` 9 — written on
  nearly every registration, read by nothing.
  
  FROM → TO, per key — all three **TOMBSTONED, not removed**, because the route was measured on
  the built face before it was chosen: `ComponentInputSchema` is a non-strict `z.object`, and an
  undeclared key parses GREEN and is silently STRIPPED, so a deletion would have swallowed 1,162
  authored values in silence. The tombstone is what makes the refusal loud and by name.
  
  - `label?: string` → `label?: never` on the interface, `retirementTombstone()` on the Zod mirror.
    Migration: delete the key. An input is identified by its `name` on every path that reaches it;
    nothing ever rendered a label for it.
  - `defaultValue?: any` → `defaultValue?: never` / `retirementTombstone()`. Migration: delete the
    key. The renderer's own fallback read IS the default; tell the author about it in `description`,
    which IS published. (Tightening the type to `unknown` was ruled out: it closes no error class,
    since nothing reads the value.)
  - `advanced?: boolean` → `advanced?: never` / `retirementTombstone()`. Migration: delete the key.
    No designer surface ever hid an "advanced" input; there is nothing to write instead.
  
  The retirement kit: `?: never` on `ComponentInput` (`packages/types/src/base.ts`), so authoring one
  is a `tsc` error at the registration site; `retirementTombstone()` on `ComponentInputSchema`
  (`packages/types/src/zod/base.zod.ts`), so an authored value is REFUSED at parse time with
  `code: 'invalid_type'`, the key named in the issue `path`, and the migration note as the message
  (one string, both channels). Pinned in
  `packages/types/src/__tests__/component-input-retired-keys-7493.test.ts`, which also holds a
  tree-scoped absence census over every `inputs:` array under `packages/**` and `apps/**`.
  
  Accept-set change, stated plainly for reviewers: a document that sets any of the three keys on a
  `ComponentInput` used to parse GREEN (the value was then dropped by the serializer) and now parses
  RED. Every in-repo authoring site — 1,199 keys across 110 registration files, the three standalone
  `ComponentInput[]` arrays and the two named input arrays `tsc` found included — is deleted in the same change, as the ruling's split rule
  requires; the `WidgetRegistry` seam no longer copies the widget-manifest values onto the synthesized
  `ComponentInput` (they fed nothing), and the data-source declaration `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT`
  drops its `label`. The patch entries on the other packages record exactly that: their registrations
  stop authoring inert keys, with no runtime or published-manifest change.
  
  The nine test files that read `defaultValue` off a registration were re-pinned against the
  renderer's ACTUAL default (its own fallback read, or the `defaultProps` it ships) instead of the
  declaration that went away; two assertions that only restated the shadow default were dropped with
  the reason on the line.
  
  The in-repo zero is what was measured. Whether anything OUTSIDE this repository writes these keys
  is not measurable from here (the objectui#5674 limit); converting such a write from a silent drop
  into a named refusal is exactly what the tombstones buy. `WidgetInput`'s own `label` /
  `defaultValue` / `advanced` (the widget-manifest face) stay declared and writable — nothing has
  ruled on that face; that it now has no reader either is recorded as objectui#7911.
- 425762e: `object-master-detail-form` declares `formType` as a closed vocabulary instead of a bare `string`.
  
  The block declared `formType` as `type: 'string'` while the sibling `object-form` declared the
  same key as an `enum`, and both funnel into the renderer that switches on those variant names. A
  value outside the vocabulary therefore matched no branch and fell through to the flat field list
  with no diagnostic — measured, a `formType` of `'wizzard'` renders the parent half with its
  authored sections silently gone.
  
  The declared set is `simple | tabbed`, measured against the master-detail composition rather than
  copied from the sibling's six: `drawer` and `modal` host the parent half in a portal dialog outside
  the master-detail container, so its single bottom Save bar has no form to submit; `wizard` mounts
  only the current step's fields and turns that Save bar into a `Next`; `split` renders inline but
  persists through `dataSource.create` instead of the atomic batch.
  
  Authoring-surface only. The manifest, the JSX-page compiler and the save gate now report an
  out-of-vocabulary value as `invalid-enum`; rejection at publish time remains `@objectstack/spec`'s.
- 83ec618: `README.md`'s "Not a `FormField` key" table said a field-level `className` is
  "read on exactly one pseudo-field, `type: 'section-divider'`". That quantifier
  holds only for the renderer's *explicit* read — `className={fp.className}` on
  the `section-divider` branch of
  `packages/components/src/renderers/form/form.tsx`. The same renderer forwards
  every key it did not destructure, and `className` is not among the names taken
  off the field config, not among the ones `stripRendererOnlyProps` removes, and
  so rides `{...fieldProps}` into `renderFieldComponent`, whose built-in `input`
  branch spreads it onto `<Input>`. A field-level `className` therefore lands
  visibly on ordinary built-in controls, and a reader taking "exactly one"
  literally concludes the opposite of what the code does (objectui#5131).
  
  The cell now describes the contract rather than the reader count: an undeclared
  key still rides the props spread down to whichever component the field resolves
  to, nothing in the contract promises that, and a registered widget honours it
  only if it happens to spread its leftover props — the wording the docs site
  already ships, so the two sources agree again. The advice in the row is
  unchanged and was never wrong (`span` / `colSpan` for width,
  `FormSchema.fieldContainerClass` for the grid), and the explicit
  `section-divider` read is kept, now named as explicit.
  
  This is a documentation fix to a file `plugin-form` publishes to npm, which is
  why it carries a version: the npm landing page only picks up the correction on a
  release. No behaviour, export, type, or `dist` byte changes.
- 43ca9d5: `SimpleObjectForm`: consult a declared `submitHandler` before the inline-fields carve-out
  
  `ObjectFormSchema.submitHandler` is documented as handing the collected values to the host INSTEAD of calling `dataSource.create` / `dataSource.update`, so a form that declares it has a submit target with or without an adapter. `SimpleObjectForm.handleSubmit` nevertheless opened with the inline-fields carve-out (`hasInlineFields && !dataSource`), which returned before the persistence chain: a host that had declared it owns the write was never asked, and `onSuccess` confirmed a write that never happened (measured `onSuccess 1 / submitHandler 0`).
  
  The carve-out now fires only when no `submitHandler` is declared, and the "no submit target" refusal moved into the persistence chain after the seam — the shape the five variant renderers already use, reusing their shared refusal from `submitTarget.ts` rather than a private copy. A form with inline fields and no seam is unchanged: its `onSuccess` is still the write.
- ba306e3: Honour the declared `submitHandler` seam in every form variant, not just the simple one.
  
  `ObjectFormSchema.submitHandler` is documented as the seam a host uses to own persistence: the form validates and hands the collected values over instead of calling `dataSource.create` / `dataSource.update`. `ObjectForm` forwarded the key into every variant it routes to, but only `SimpleObjectForm` read it — `TabbedForm`, `WizardForm`, `SplitForm`, `DrawerForm` and `ModalForm` persisted directly.
  
  **Behaviour change on a persistence path.** A master-detail parent half rendered `tabbed` (or `split`) now commits through the atomic `batchTransaction` together with its child collections, instead of writing the parent independently through `dataSource.create`. Previously the child leg was never attempted on those layouts: the parent was committed alone, the entered line items were silently discarded, no compensation ran, and a success toast confirmed the save. A failing child leg now leaves no committed parent, on every layout that renders the parent half inline.
  
  `WizardForm` additionally skips its own default success toast / redirect arms when a `submitHandler` is present, matching `ObjectForm`, so a host that owns the write also owns the outcome.
  
  The `object-master-detail-form.formType` vocabulary is unchanged and stays `simple | tabbed`.
- 26a2238: `navigateOnSuccess` now honours a mounted host, and says so when its destination is refused
  
  `ObjectForm` and `WizardForm` consume `navigateOnSuccess` through
  `resolveSuccessNavigate`, and both arms travelled to an accepted destination with a bare
  `window.location.assign`. A rooted path such as `/apps/x/o/record/{id}` assigned that way
  resolves against the ORIGIN root, so under a host mounted at a sub-path (the framework CLI
  configures one for every embedded deployment) an authored in-app destination left the
  application. Both arms now route an app-relative destination through the injected
  navigation seam both components already held for `submitBehavior.url`, so a mounted host's
  basename is applied. With no host seam the behaviour is byte-for-byte what it was — a host
  with no router has no basename, so origin-rooted resolution is already correct there. A
  same-origin ABSOLUTE destination also keeps browser-level navigation: the seam's declared
  input is an application-relative path, and an author who spelled out a whole address asked
  for that address.
  
  A declared `navigateOnSuccess` whose destination is refused — a mistyped value, or a written
  record carrying no usable id — used to produce a success toast identical to the one a form
  with no `navigateOnSuccess` produces, so the navigation failed with nobody told. That toast
  now carries a note that the declared navigation did not happen, and the template the author
  wrote is logged for them. The write genuinely succeeded, so this stays a success rather than
  becoming an error state.
  
  Which destinations are ACCEPTED is unchanged: the same-origin guard, the `{id}` /
  `{recordId}` dialect and the unescaped interpolation are the subject of an open contract
  question and are deliberately untouched here.
- 5d79faf: Variant forms refuse a submit that has nowhere to go, instead of reporting success
  
  `TabbedForm`, `WizardForm`, `SplitForm`, `DrawerForm` and `ModalForm` each opened
  `handleSubmit` with `if (!dataSource) { await schema.onSuccess?.(data); return data; }`
  — a success signal emitted without consulting a declared `submitHandler` and without
  persisting anything. Through `MasterDetailForm`, whose parent schema declares both
  `submitHandler: submitViaBatch` and `onSuccess: handleSaved`, that produced a success
  toast and, in create mode, a form reset clearing values nobody wrote.
  
  All five now answer the question the same way `SimpleObjectForm` and the `object-form`
  element gate already do. A form has a submit target when it has a `dataSource` or a
  declared `submitHandler`; with neither, the one legitimate shape is inline fields —
  a non-empty `customFields`, or `sections` whose fields are all inline runtime
  `FormField` objects — whose `onSuccess` is the write. Anything else throws
  `DataSource is required for form submission (inline mode not configured)`, which
  reaches `schema.onError` and is rethrown. A declared `submitHandler` is consulted
  first, so a host that owns the write is never bypassed for want of an adapter it
  never needed.

## 17.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c0d52e: A form's ruled `submitBehavior.url` redirect can now be performed by the HOST, so a destination stays inside a console mounted at a sub-path (objectui#4989 defect 4).
  
  `ObjectForm` and `WizardForm` accept a relative in-app path and used to travel to it with `window.location.assign`. A rooted path resolves against the ORIGIN there, so under a mounted host — `<BrowserRouter basename="/_console">`, which the framework CLI configures for every embedded deployment — an authored `/thanks` left the application. The destination was correct and the navigation was wrong, and a published renderer cannot fix that alone: only the host knows its mount.
  
  **New: `HostNavigationContext` (`@object-ui/react`).** A host offers its own navigate; a renderer uses it when it is there:
  
  ```tsx
  import { HostNavigationProvider } from '@object-ui/react';
  import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
  
  function Bridge({ children }) {
    const navigate = useNavigate();
    return (
      <HostNavigationProvider value={{ navigate: (to, o) => navigate(to, { replace: o?.replace ?? false }) }}>
        {children}
      </HostNavigationProvider>
    );
  }
  ```
  
  `@object-ui/app-shell`'s `ConsoleShell` now mounts that bridge above every console route, so the console's own routes, and its basename, are what a post-submit redirect resolves against — and the redirect becomes an SPA transition instead of a full page load.
  
  **Nothing changes for a host that wires nothing.** With no provider the behaviour is byte-for-byte what it was: one `window.location.assign` of the resolved path after the declared `delayMs`. A host with no router has no basename, so origin-rooted resolution is already right there — the seam changes what a MOUNTED host gets and nothing else. `useHostNavigation()` outside a provider answers `{ navigate: undefined }` and never throws.
  
  Two mechanisms were weighed and rejected by the ruling, recorded so they are not re-proposed. **Reading React Router's context when a router happens to be present** is implicit, and unavailable anyway: a React context is a module-instance object, so reading the host's means importing `react-router` into the renderer — which `@object-ui/plugin-form` declares in none of its dependency fields, whose published build externalises every bare specifier, and which two real consumers (`apps/site`, `packages/plugin-view`) do not install. **Requiring `react-router` as a peer** is the honest version of the same thing and costs the package its property of dropping into any React application.
  
  What the host takes on by supplying a navigate: the destination becomes a client-side transition, so an in-app path with no matching route renders the host's not-found instead of a full page load. That is the host's routing table to answer for, which is why the choice is the host's. The contract verdict is unchanged either way — a destination `@objectstack/spec` refuses is refused identically with or without a seam, so an injected navigate can never launder a value the authoring door rejects.
  
  `navigateOnSuccess` is a different declared key with its own open contract question (objectui#5034) and is deliberately untouched here.

### Patch Changes

- 9b20dea: Fix: a `drawer` form with no `sections` now renders the object's declared
  `fieldGroups` as sections, matching `ObjectForm` and `ModalForm`.
  
  `deriveFieldGroupSections` had exactly two call sites in the repo —
  `ObjectForm` and `ModalForm` — so the same object, with the same metadata,
  rendered one section per declared group in the modal create dialog and one
  ungrouped flat list in the drawer. The author who laid the groups out in the
  object designer saw them honoured on two surfaces out of three.
  
  `DrawerForm` now runs the same fallback the modal does: gated on "no explicit
  `sections`, no `customFields`", over the same auto-layout-filtered field list
  (system fields dropped, auto-generated fields dropped in create mode), with the
  flat path's inferred column count carried onto the grouped layout. A curated
  `sections` list from a form view still wins, and an object whose fields join no
  declared group keeps its flat layout untouched. A derived group declaring
  ADR-0085 `collapse` renders as a collapsible header, like an authored one.
- 469b604: Fix: a `drawer` form with no `sections` now honours the object's field-level
  conditional rules (`visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen`) and field
  `group`.
  
  `ModalForm` and `DrawerForm` each carried their own copy of the "object-schema
  field to runtime FormField" loop for the no-sections case, and the drawer's
  copy had fallen behind: it stopped at `multiple`, so the ADR-0036 predicates
  never reached the runtime field and `resolveFieldRuleState` had nothing to
  resolve. A hidden field rendered anyway, a frozen field stayed editable (with
  the server then dropping the write), and a conditionally-required field never
  blocked the submit.
  
  Both containers now build that list through one shared `buildFlatFields`, which
  resolves each field through the same `fromObjectSchema` the sectioned path uses
  — so the next field-mapping fix lands once and reaches every container.
- d7be3bd: `EmbeddableForm`'s thank-you redirect stops being mount-blind: an in-app destination now goes through the host's injected navigate.
  
  The redirect ended in one unconditional `window.location.href = url`. That is
  right for the external destination this key deliberately admits, and wrong for
  the in-app one it equally admits: a rooted path such as `/thanks` assigned to
  `location.href` resolves against the ORIGIN root, so under a host mounted at a
  sub-path — the framework CLI configures one for every embedded deployment, and
  the console runs at basename `/_console` — the submitter landed outside the
  application, usually on the host's own 404. Nothing refused either half of that
  authoring, so the failure was silent. This is objectui#4989 defect 4 on the key
  that card explicitly did not cover, and it is fixed here through the seam
  objectui#5111 landed (`HostNavigationContext`, `@object-ui/react`).
  
  The destinations are now split by who can travel to them:
  
  - an **app-relative** destination (`/thanks`, `thanks`, `?ok=1`, `#done`) is
    handed to the host's navigate when a host supplied one, so a mounted host
    places it inside its mount; with no provider the behaviour is byte-for-byte
    what it was — a host with no router has no basename, so origin-rooted
    resolution is already correct there;
  - an **external** destination admitted by `allowedRedirectHosts` keeps
    browser-level navigation **unconditionally**. This is the seam's own declared
    input contract, not a conservatism: `HostNavigationValue.navigate` documents
    `to` as an application-relative path, "never an absolute URL", because a host
    navigate is a client-side router transition. Since a relative reference cannot
    carry an authority, the seam is now structurally incapable of being handed a
    cross-origin URL.
  
  A same-origin **absolute** URL — the one shape those two arms do not name — also
  keeps browser-level navigation. Routing it through the seam would mean rewriting
  the author's full address into a path a mounted router then places at a
  different address; an author who spelled out the whole address asked for that
  address.
  
  Not changed, deliberately: `isRedirectUrlSafe` and `allowedRedirectHosts` —
  WHICH destinations are followed. That acceptance set (same-origin OR the
  author's allowlist) is this key's own contract, a refused destination reaches
  neither the seam nor the browser, and objectstack#7496's relative-only ruling
  belongs to `submitBehavior.url` and is not imported onto this key. The wait's
  ownership (objectui#5049) and the thank-you panel's copy (objectui#5073) are
  carried over unchanged: unmounting or pressing "Submit Another Response" still
  cancels a pending redirect, seam or no seam.
- a954b48: A public form's thank-you countdown ("Redirecting in {{seconds}} seconds…") now
  actually counts down, instead of rendering a number once and leaving it frozen
  for the whole wait.
  
  All ten locale packs document `publicForm.redirecting`'s `{{seconds}}` as "the
  remaining seconds", but `EmbeddableForm` computed it exactly once — at the render
  that first shows the thank-you panel — from `pendingRedirect.delayMs`, and never
  touched it again. On the 3 second default delay, a submitter saw a fully static
  "Redirecting in 3 seconds…" for the entire wait (objectui#5083).
  
  The number is now owned by a per-second `setInterval`, on the same ownership
  model PR #5070 established for the redirect wait itself: an effect keyed on the
  accepted destination (`pendingRedirect`), cancelled on unmount and on
  `handleReset`'s `Submit Another Response` — the exact regression surface
  objectui#5049 fixed for the navigation timer, restated here rather than
  reintroduced. The interval also stops itself once it reaches 0, rather than
  ticking indefinitely past a wait that has already ended.
  
  Nothing about WHICH destinations are followed or refused changes
  (`isRedirectUrlSafe` / `allowedRedirectHosts`, objectui#4989), and neither does
  the navigation wait's own ownership (objectui#5049 / PR #5070) — this is the
  display only.
- bda9b12: A public form's thank-you panel no longer promises a redirect its own guard just
  refused, and the `texts.redirectBlocked` string can finally reach a screen.
  
  `EmbeddableForm` decided whether to redirect from `isRedirectUrlSafe` /
  `allowedRedirectHosts`, but the panel's copy was keyed on something else: whether
  a `thankYouPage.redirectUrl` had been *authored* (objectui#5073). An author who
  declared a cross-origin destination without allowlisting its host therefore got a
  submitter who was told `Redirecting in 3 seconds…` and was then never redirected.
  The guard did its job; the screen contradicted it. That screen is the terminal
  state of a public form, so nothing came after to correct the impression.
  
  On the same path, the `texts.redirectBlocked` string the refusal set was
  unreachable in every locale. It was recorded with `setError(...)`, whose banner
  lives in the form branch — and `setSubmitted(true)` has already run one statement
  earlier, so the component is showing the thank-you branch, which renders no error
  at all. That was the only assignment of the key anywhere; pressing
  `Submit Another Response` cleared it rather than showing it.
  
  Both now follow the verdict:
  
  - The countdown renders on `pendingRedirect` — the destination that was actually
    accepted — and reads its seconds from the delay captured with it, so the
    displayed wait is the wait being served. A refused destination, and the
    honeypot's silent fake-success (which accepts no destination either), simply
    omit the line.
  - A refused destination renders `texts.redirectBlocked` in the thank-you panel
    when the author declared it — the case the key exists for, in the author's own
    words to the public. Undeclared means silence; the author keeps the existing
    `console.warn`, which is the channel for the person who can fix the
    declaration.
  
  Which destinations are refused is unchanged: `isRedirectUrlSafe` and
  `allowedRedirectHosts` are untouched, as is the timer ownership introduced for
  objectui#5049. Nothing was ever at risk in the data — the write succeeds before
  any of this — the harm was a false statement on the confirmation screen and a
  shipped, translated string no user could see.
- e354dd0: A public form's thank-you redirect no longer outlives the form that armed it, and
  "Submit Another Response" now cancels it.
  
  `EmbeddableForm` armed the `thankYouPage.redirectUrl` wait with a bare
  `setTimeout` inside the submit handler: the handle was not stored, nothing cleared
  it, and no part of the component owned it (objectui#5049). Two consequences, and
  the second needs no unmount at all:
  
  - For the whole of the delay a full-page navigation was pending that survived the
    form being taken off screen — an embed removed by the host page, a route change,
    a re-keyed subtree. With `redirectDelay` unset that window is the 3000 ms
    default, so this was the normal state of every submit on this surface rather
    than an edge authoring; the thank-you panel says as much out loud with
    `Redirecting in {{seconds}} seconds…`.
  - Under `allowMultiple`, `Submit Another Response` only flipped `submitted` back
    to false while the pending navigation kept ticking. The component invited the
    submitter into a fresh form and then, about three seconds later, threw the whole
    page away while they were typing the next response.
  
  The wait now lives in an effect keyed on the accepted destination, with a
  `clearTimeout` cleanup, so unmounting cancels it; and `handleReset` drops the
  destination, so pressing `Submit Another Response` cancels it too. The button
  offers the submitter a fresh form, and that offer cannot be honoured alongside
  discarding the page a moment later. This is the same move `ObjectForm` /
  `WizardForm` (objectui#5033) and `apps/console`'s `FormPage` already made for
  their own copies of this defect.
  
  Nothing else changed. Which destinations are followed and which are refused is
  still decided by the same `isRedirectUrlSafe` / `allowedRedirectHosts` guard, on
  the same line as before — only who owns the wait changed. The delay is captured
  together with the destination at the moment the write is accepted, so a host
  re-rendering with a different `redirectDelay` mid-wait cannot restart the pause
  under the submitter. The countdown copy is untouched. No data was ever at risk:
  the write has already succeeded before the wait begins, so the harm was a
  surprising navigation — and, on the `allowMultiple` path, the loss of what the
  submitter had just re-typed.
- f68018d: A form's declared redirect delay no longer outlives the form that armed it.
  
  `ObjectForm` and `WizardForm` consumed `submitBehavior: { kind: 'redirect' }` by
  arming the `delayMs` wait with a bare `setTimeout` inside the submit handler. The
  handle was not stored, nothing cleared it on unmount, and no part of the component
  owned it — so for the whole of the declared delay there was a pending full-page
  navigation that survived the form being taken off screen (objectui#5033). A
  submitter who dismissed the modal or drawer variant after the confirmation, who
  clicked an in-app link, or whose host re-keyed the subtree for its own reasons was
  pulled away from wherever they had gone by a timer belonging to a form that no
  longer existed. The longer the authored delay, the wider that window — and a
  non-trivial delay is the intended authoring, since `delayMs` exists so the
  confirmation is readable before the redirect.
  
  The wait now lives in an effect keyed on the accepted destination, with a
  `clearTimeout` cleanup, so unmounting cancels it. This is the same move
  `apps/console`'s `FormPage` already made for its own copy of this defect.
  
  `delayMs` semantics are unchanged: the pause is still a pause, an unset value is
  still "go now" (a zero timer, exactly as the in-handler version scheduled it), and
  which destinations are followed or refused is untouched — the contract verdict
  that decides WHETHER to navigate is the same one, only WHEN it happens is now
  owned by the component. The delay is captured together with the destination at the
  moment the write is accepted, so a host re-rendering with a different `delayMs`
  mid-wait cannot restart the pause under the submitter. Nothing was ever at risk of
  being lost: the write has already succeeded before the wait begins, so the harm
  was a surprising navigation, not a corrupted record.
- 375efb4: Publish the authoring surfaces of the four GA `object-*` blocks
  
  `object-form`, `object-grid`, `object-master-detail-form` and `object-metric`
  each honoured far more keys than they declared as registry `inputs`. An author —
  very often an AI author — who wrote one of the undeclared keys got an
  `unknown-prop` report from `sdui-parser` on a key that works, while the designer
  panel and the generated `sdui-intrinsics.d.ts` denied it existed.
  
  68 keys are now declared with descriptions written to teach correct authoring:
  `object-form` +20 (record binding, button labels, post-submit behaviour, mobile
  overrides), `object-grid` +21 (sorting, pagination, grouping, selection, row and
  bulk actions, navigation, export), `object-master-detail-form` +10, and
  `object-metric` +14 (formatting, comparison, drill-down). No renderer behaviour
  changes — this documents what already shipped, so the manifest, the generated
  `.d.ts`, the designer panel and the renderers finally agree.
  
  Ten of `object-grid`'s spec-declared keys are deliberately NOT published:
  its own `@deprecated` legacy spellings (`fields`, `staticData`, `selectable`,
  `pageSize`, `showSearch`, `showPagination`, `defaultSort`, `defaultFilters`,
  `resizableColumns`, `title`). The renderer keeps reading them so existing
  documents render, but recommending a deprecated alias as new authoring surface
  would harden it into a second dialect. Each canonical replacement — `columns`,
  `data`, `selection`, `pagination`, `searchableFields`, `sort`, `filter`,
  `resizable`, `label` — is declared, and each carries a description naming the
  legacy spelling it supersedes.
- 800f455: fix(fields): grid columns are keyed by the declared `name`, so spec-compliant grid metadata renders populated cells
  
  `GridField` declared its own column interface keyed by `field` and read
  `c.field` at every site (`key=`, `row[…]`, the blank row, cell writes, the
  column chooser, the running-total lookup), while the published
  `GridColumnDefinition` in `@object-ui/types` — and the grid documentation, and
  the `fields-grid` catalog examples — declare the key as `name`. Metadata
  authored against the published type therefore rendered a grid with the correct
  row count and every cell empty, plus a React "unique key" warning per column.
  
  The renderer now reads the declared `name`, and the master-detail derivation
  (`deriveColumns` / `hydrateColumns` / `pickAmountField`) produces and consumes
  the same key. There is deliberately **no** `col.field ?? col.name` alias: one
  spelling at the producer (AGENTS.md #0.1).
  
  **Breaking for `field`-keyed columns.** Grid / line-item / master-detail
  subform columns spelled `{ field: 'amount' }` must be re-spelled
  `{ name: 'amount' }`. This affects author-supplied `columns` on the `grid`
  field, `record:line_items`, `object-master-detail-form` details and a
  relationship field's `inlineColumns`. Auto-derived columns (no explicit
  `columns` block) need no change. List-view and `object-grid` columns are a
  different contract (`ListColumn`) and keep their own `field` key.
- 3b03704: `mobile.fullscreenLongText` now reaches fields the spec spells `richtext` (objectui#4831).
  
  `ObjectForm` is the one and only producer of the `mobile_fullscreen` flag: when a form
  sets `mobile: { fullscreenLongText: true }` it stamps that flag onto the metadata of
  every long-text field, and the widget renders an expand affordance plus a full-height
  editing dialog from it. The list of types it stamped was four hand-written literals —
  `textarea`, `field:textarea`, `field:markdown`, `field:html` — and `field:richtext` was
  not among them.
  
  `richtext` is the name `@objectstack/spec`'s `FieldType` gives this type; `markdown` and
  `html` are the other two, and all three are registry keys on ONE widget, `RichTextField`,
  which has read the flag since objectui#3301. So the consumer side was complete and two of
  the widget's three keys were stamped: a field authored exactly as the spec prescribes
  (`type: richtext`) rendered the rich-text editor with no expand button, on a form whose
  `mobile` documentation promises "textarea/rich-text get an expand button". `markdown` and
  `html` beside it worked. This is the same hole objectui#4250 found in this package's
  `WIDE_FIELD_TYPES`, which is why the twin set already lists `richtext` and this one did
  not.
  
  Adding the missing key is the whole change; no other type's behaviour moves, and a form
  that has not opted in still stamps nothing.
- 958d757: The plugin-form documentation-site page now teaches the `validation` shape the
  form renderer actually reads, so a copied example validates instead of only
  looking as though it does.
  
  `content/docs/plugins/plugin-form.mdx` carried the same two defects
  `packages/plugin-form/README.md` did before it was rewritten (objectui#5075 /
  objectui#5118): the README half was fixed and the documentation-site mirror was
  not touched.
  
  `### Form Field` redeclared a local `interface FormField` whose `validation` was
  `ValidationRule[]`. No `ValidationRule` type exists in this repository under any
  spelling, and `validation` is not an array — it is `FieldValidationRules`
  (`packages/types/src/form.ts`), an object keyed by rule name. The block also
  listed `defaultValue` and `className`, neither of which is a declared member of
  `FormField`, and marked `type` and `label` required when `name` is the only
  required key of the 23. The section no longer declares a local interface at all
  — a hand-written `interface` in a documentation snippet compiles nowhere, which
  is how it drifted this far — and references the declared keys instead, each one
  measured against the renderer's read points.
  
  `### Form with Validation` authored the array to match, and that spelling fails
  silently rather than loudly. The only reader of the key spreads it into the rule
  object handed to react-hook-form (`const rules: any = { ...validation }`,
  `packages/components/src/renderers/form/form.tsx:1652`); spreading an array
  produces numeric keys, react-hook-form recognises none of them, and every rule
  is dropped without an error. Measured against the real renderer: the old snippet
  submits a two-character username under `minLength: 3` with no message shown,
  while the rewritten one blocks it. The example is now annotated `FormSchema`, so
  the array spelling is a compile error (TS2559) rather than a runtime surprise,
  and a JSON variant is given alongside it for metadata authoring.
  
  Three facts a reader could previously only discover by experiment are now
  stated: `validation.required` supplies the required *message* while `required` /
  `requiredWhen` on the field decide whether it is required; there is no `email`
  rule name, an email check is a `pattern`; and a hand-authored `pattern` has to
  carry a RegExp, because react-hook-form applies a pattern only when its value is
  `instanceof RegExp` — it is the object-metadata path (`buildValidationRules`)
  that compiles a declared string into one.
  
  The two `DOC_TYPE_EXEMPTIONS` entries this page held in
  `scripts/check-doc-component-types.mjs` are deleted with it. They exempted
  `minLength` / `maxLength` as "ValidationRule discriminants under a field's
  `validation[]`" — a reason whose every clause was the fiction being removed —
  and without them the gate now fails if the array spelling returns.
- bfb64ee: `plugin-form` README: the "Integration with Data Sources" section now teaches the adapter's real path instead of two keys no form renderer reads.
  
  The section taught backend wiring as two keys on a form schema — `dataSource`
  (the adapter itself) and `resource: 'users'` — on an un-annotated
  `const schema = { … }`. Neither key is read anywhere on either form route:
  
  - **`dataSource`** is *discarded* by the basic form. The renderer reads its
    adapter off `SchemaRendererContext`
    (`packages/components/src/renderers/form/form.tsx:1004`) and passes it down per
    field (`:2061`); a same-named key arriving on the schema or props is dropped by
    the discard destructures at `form.tsx:304` and `:2168`, so it reaches neither a
    widget nor the DOM.
  - **`resource`** is declared on neither `FormSchema` nor `ObjectFormSchema`. The
    key exists in the protocol, but on `CRUDSchema` (`packages/types/src/crud.ts`,
    `type: 'crud'`); no form renderer reads it under any spelling.
  
  Both survived compilation because `FormSchema` and `ObjectFormSchema` extend
  `BaseSchema`, which declares `[key: string]: any` — so an invented key is never a
  type error, merely never read. A reader who copied the block got a form that did
  not connect to a backend, with nothing reported: what appeared to work was the
  hand-written `onSubmit` closure, which genuinely runs (the renderer awaits it at
  `form.tsx:1428`) using the adapter its *closure* captured, entirely independently
  of the two keys beside it.
  
  The section is rewritten around the real mechanism: the adapter is injected once
  by `SchemaRendererProvider` and travels on context, the metadata route uses
  `object-form` with its required `objectName` + `mode`, and the TypeScript route
  is a bare `form` whose `onSubmit` owns persistence. Both examples now carry real
  type annotations (`ObjectFormSchema` / `FormSchema`) in line with the rest of the
  file — an un-annotated object literal type-checks whatever is written in it. A
  closing note records the one thing a top-level `dataSource` *does* mean on a
  schema node: the spec's element binding (`{ object }`, objectstack#6953), which
  explicitly rejects a live adapter (`element-data-source.ts:131` refuses any value
  carrying a `find` method).
  
  Documentation only — no source, type or behavior change. This also removes a
  self-contradiction inside the same README, whose "Registering a component under
  your own key" section already stated the rule correctly ("never a `dataSource` —
  that travels on `SchemaRendererContext`").
- e09f9e8: Docs only: `packages/plugin-form/README.md`'s Schema API and Examples now spell
  the keys the form renderers actually read (objectui#5075). Three connected
  drifts, judged against the build product's `dist/index.d.ts` under `strict`:
  
  - **`validation` was written as an ARRAY** of `{ type, value, message }` entries
    in three places. The real key is `FormField.validation?: FieldValidationRules`
    — an OBJECT keyed by rule name (`required`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `min`,
    `max`, `pattern`, `validate`). The array form is worse than a type error,
    because its runtime failure is SILENT: the only reader spreads the value into
    the rule object handed to react-hook-form (`const rules: any = { ...validation }`,
    `packages/components/src/renderers/form/form.tsx:1652`), and spreading an array
    into an object literal yields numeric keys (`{ '0': …, '1': … }`).
    react-hook-form's field validator reads exactly `required`, `maxLength`,
    `minLength`, `min`, `max`, `pattern`, `validate`, `valueAsNumber` off its
    descriptor, so every documented rule was dropped with nothing thrown — a form
    copied from this README looked validated while validating nothing. The rewrite
    also records two facts a reader could not have guessed: `validation.required`
    supplies the required MESSAGE only (presence is decided by the field's own
    `required` / `requiredWhen`), and a hand-authored `pattern.value` must be a
    RegExp, since react-hook-form only applies a pattern whose value
    `instanceof RegExp` and it is the object-metadata path (`buildValidationRules`)
    that compiles a declared string into one.
  
  - **`type: 'multi-step-form'` is registered nowhere**, and `steps` is not a key
    on any form schema — so the whole "Multi-Step Form" example rendered the
    unknown-component placeholder, with the fields inside `steps` never read. The
    example is replaced by the two real entry points: an `object-form` with
    `formType: 'wizard'`, whose steps are its `sections` (this is what
    `ObjectForm` routes to `WizardForm`), and the exported `WizardForm` itself
    with inline section fields and no data source — the shape closest to what the
    old snippet was reaching for. No new schema type was registered to make the
    old spelling true.
  
  - **The `FormField` reference block declared a local `interface FormField`**,
    which type-checks whatever it says because it is unrelated to the real type.
    Five of its rows were wrong (`type` and `label` are OPTIONAL; `validation` is
    the object above; `defaultValue` and `className` are not declared keys — the
    form-level `defaultValues` and `span` / `colSpan` / `fieldContainerClass` are),
    it named a `ValidationRule` type that exists nowhere in the repo, and it listed
    7 of the real 23 keys. The block is now a key table over the real declaration,
    with `FormSchema`'s own keys beside it, and both examples are annotated with
    their real types — the annotation is the point: `FormField` and `BaseSchema`
    both declare `[key: string]: any`, so an un-annotated `const schema = { … }`
    accepts any invented key and a nonexistent key is never a compile error.
  
  No renderer behaviour changes, and no capability, export or type was added to
  make an example true.
- 03e5f97: `packages/plugin-form/README.md`: three assertions about this package's export
  surface were false, and the export names are now taken from the built
  `dist/index.d.ts` (TS compiler API `checker.getExportsOfModule`) with every
  TypeScript block compiled against those same declarations under `strict`.
  
  - **`formComponents`** — fiction, and not a name that could be corrected: there
    is no aggregate component map on the surface at all, so the "Manual
    Registration" section described a mechanism that does not exist. Copying it got
    `undefined` and threw on `Object.entries(undefined)`. It is replaced by what
    actually happens: registration is a side effect of importing the entry, whose
    six `ComponentRegistry.register(...)` calls claim
    `plugin-form:object-form`, `view:form`, `plugin-form:embeddable-form`,
    `plugin-form:form-analytics`, `plugin-form:object-master-detail-form` and
    `record:line_items` — the two `skipFallback: true` calls being why bare `form`
    and bare `line_items` are *not* taken over. The section also lists the real
    export surface, and shows the thing the old snippet was reaching for: putting
    an exported component on a schema type of your own, with the caveat that the
    package's own registered renderers are internal wrappers that first resolve
    `dataSource` from `SchemaRendererContext`.
  - **`FormSchema` / `FormField`** — real types imported from the wrong package.
    Both are protocol types declared in `@object-ui/types` (`src/form.ts`); this
    package imports them and does not re-export them, so the documented import was
    a `TS2305` pair. Only the import path changed — no re-export was added to make
    the old path true, since widening a package's public surface is a contract
    change and not a documentation fix. The section now also points at the form
    types that *are* on this entry (`TabbedFormSchema`, `WizardFormSchema`,
    `ModalFormSchema`, …).
  - **`isRuntimeDefault` "(re-exported here)"** — the create-defaults section
    claimed the predicate is re-exported by this package. It is re-exported by
    `src/schemaDefaults.ts` for internal use only, never from the entry, and the
    package publishes just the `"."` export — so `import { isRuntimeDefault } from
    '@object-ui/plugin-form'` is another `TS2305`. The parenthetical now says where
    the re-export actually lives.
  
  No code, types or runtime behaviour change — the diff is one README plus this
  changeset. It declares a patch because `README.md` is in the package's published
  `files`, so the correction reaches npm with the next release.
- ae804ec: `ObjectForm` and `WizardForm` now consume a declared `submitBehavior: { kind: 'redirect' }` the way objectstack#7496 ruled it (objectui#4989): the destination is a **relative** path, `{{record.field_name}}` tokens are substituted from the record the submit just wrote and URL-escaped as the redirect is built, and a destination outside the contract is **refused on screen** instead of being dropped in silence.
  
  Both call sites previously read the value through `isSameOriginUrl` — resolve against `window.location.href`, compare origins — and navigated when that answered yes. That is not an open redirect (a cross-origin destination never reached the navigation) but it diverged from the ruled contract three ways, all fixed here:
  
  - **An out-of-contract destination was dropped in silence.** When the guard answered no the `if` simply did not fire: no toast, no error, no confirmation. The write had already succeeded, so the submitter was left facing a still-filled form with no feedback about what happened — and the obvious next move, submitting again, wrote a second record. A refusal now shows the spec's own author-facing prescription in an alert beside the confirmation that the record WAS written, toasts it, and replaces the filled form so there is nothing left to resubmit. Silence is the one outcome the ruling's consumer half rules out.
  - **A same-origin ABSOLUTE url was followed**, where the contract is relative-only — so this renderer accepted a spelling the authoring door refuses, which is how a rejected spelling stays alive in a corpus. The verdict is no longer restated here at all: `resolveSubmitRedirect` asks `@objectstack/spec`'s own `FormViewSchema` at the moment of use, so an absolute URL, a protocol-relative `//host`, a backslash, a whitespace or control-character smuggle, a malformed token or a document-relative path is refused with the spec's own wording — and a later widening of the ruling is followed by the version pin rather than by an edit here.
  - **`{{record.field_name}}` tokens were never substituted**, so an authored `/thanks?ref={{record.id}}` navigated with the literal braces in the query. Substitution now happens where the ruling assigns it — when the redirect is built — from the values as submitted with whatever the DataSource answered layered on top, and every interpolated value goes through `encodeURIComponent`, so a token is a value in the path and never a way to add path structure.
  
  `delayMs` semantics are unchanged. `navigateOnSuccess` is a different declared key with its own dialect and its own open contract question, and is deliberately untouched; `isSameOriginUrl` survives because that key still needs it.
  
  **Escalated rather than guessed at, and since ruled:** this change left a ruled in-app path handed to a browser-level navigation, which resolves it against the origin root, so under a host mounted at a sub-path the destination still left the app (objectui#4989 defect 4). Applying the mount means learning it, and every mechanism available to a published renderer package changes its contract. The maintainer ruled the mechanism on 2026-08-17 — an optional injected navigation seam — and it ships in the same release; see the `plugin-form-injected-navigation-4989` changeset for what a host now supplies and what a host that supplies nothing still gets.
- d971e51: A create form no longer deadlocks on a `requiredWhen` field that also declares a runtime `defaultValue`.
  
  `#4069` ruled that in **create** mode a field whose `defaultValue` is a runtime
  instruction the server resolves per insert (`NOW()` / `current_user`, or a CEL
  Expression envelope) is producer-owned: the control is deliberately left empty
  and the key is omitted from the payload, because `ObjectQL.applyFieldDefaults`
  resolves the declaration only for a field that arrives absent or null. That was
  implemented on the STATIC `required` flag.
  
  The conditional spelling was not covered. `requiredWhen` is resolved one layer
  downstream, in the form renderer, against the live record — so a predicate
  resolving TRUE on a create form put the requirement straight back: the control
  was still empty by design, the submit was refused, and the user had nothing
  sensible to type.
  
  Both spellings now behave identically on a producer-owned field. A
  `requiredWhen` predicate is a claim about the value at rest in a given state,
  and `NOW()` / `current_user` resolve at insert regardless of state, so the
  producer's guarantee covers the conditional claim by the same argument that
  covers the unconditional one. An author who really means "the user must supply
  this in this state" has a natural spelling for it: do not declare the default.
  
  The suppression lands in the single evaluator both layers read,
  `resolveFieldRuleState` — the same verdict that draws the required marker and
  the one the submit-time check consults — so a field can never lose its asterisk
  while still refusing the write. The classifier that answers "is this value the
  producer's to supply" moved down to `@object-ui/core`
  (`isRuntimeDefault` / `isServerOwnedValue`, re-exported from
  `@object-ui/plugin-form`) so the renderer, the wizard's cross-step gate and the
  create-form field builders all read one implementation rather than three.
  
  **Edit mode is unchanged.** Defaults do not re-apply to an existing record, so
  on a persisted row the token was already resolved at insert and blanking the
  column is a real removal: `requiredWhen` enforces there exactly as authored.
  Fields with no declared default, and fields whose default is a static literal
  (which IS seeded into the control), are also unaffected in both modes.
- 2165d88: Rename four component-props types off the names `@objectstack/spec` starts owning in
  17.0.0, keeping the old spellings as deprecated aliases. No behaviour changes and no
  importer breaks.
  
  `@objectstack/spec/ui` exports `ObjectCalendarProps`, `ObjectFormProps`, `ObjectGridProps`
  and `ObjectKanbanProps` from 17.0.0, where each is the AUTHORED props document of the
  matching element — a serialisable authoring surface (`z.input< typeof
  ObjectGridPropsSchema >`). The same-named interfaces here are the RENDERERS' props: a live
  `dataSource`, records pre-fetched by a parent, and the host callbacks. Two different things
  under one word, so the local ones are renamed rather than derived, following the split this
  repo already made for `PageHeaderProps` -> `PageHeaderComponentProps` and the
  `Record*ComponentProps` family in `@object-ui/types`:
  
  | package | new name | old name |
  |---|---|---|
  | `@object-ui/plugin-calendar` | `ObjectCalendarComponentProps` | `ObjectCalendarProps` |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-form` | `ObjectFormComponentProps` | `ObjectFormProps` |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-grid` | `ObjectGridComponentProps` | `ObjectGridProps` |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-kanban` | `ObjectKanbanComponentProps` | `ObjectKanbanProps` |
  
  Every old name is still exported from its package barrel as a `@deprecated` alias denoting
  the SAME type, pinned per package by `spec-symbol-4650.test.ts`, so existing imports keep
  compiling. New code should use the `ComponentProps` spelling.
  
  `@object-ui/app-shell` carries no API change: its `SECRET_MASK` — the ADR-0100 credential
  read mask, which 17.0.0 moves into `@objectstack/spec/data` — is renamed to
  `OBJECTUI_SECRET_MASK` at its declaration in `views/metadata-admin/widgets.tsx`. That
  constant is package-internal and is not re-exported from the barrel, so nothing published
  changes; the rename exists so the local copy cannot be read as the spec's own definition
  while this repo is still pinned below the release that exports it.

### Patch Changes

- ae10a01: Console chrome reaches the bundle — the list switcher, the aggregate footer, the dialog a11y fallbacks and the whole Settings namespace screen stop being English on non-English consoles

  Six strings on the two screens a user looks at most were hardcoded English literals rather than bundle lookups, so they stayed English on every non-English console with nothing an app could author to change them. They are not object, field, view or action labels — no key in `TranslationData` reaches them — while the console's own bundle already ships zh-CN, ja-JP, es-ES, de, fr, pt, ru, ko and ar and translates hundreds of neighbouring strings. Omissions from an otherwise complete bundle, not a missing capability.

  **Two of the six needed no new keys at all, which is the more interesting half.** The list-view mode switcher named its nine visualizations from a private `VIEW_LABELS` table while `console.objectView.viewType*` — the same nine words — had been resolved through the bundle by the create-view picker for months; the switcher now reads those keys, so the picker's 「画廊」 and the switcher's 「画廊」 cannot drift apart in nine languages. The create/edit dialog's close button is the remainder of a fix that already landed: objectstack#5505 routed the `sr-only` close label through `common.close` for the two Shadcn-synced primitives, but `MobileDialogContent` is a hand-written wrapper outside that regeneration zone with its own close button, and it is exactly what `ModalForm` renders — so the dialog the report measured was the one place still announcing "Close" in English.

  The aggregate footer is the one the original report singled out: the **number** was already locale-formatted and the **prefix** was a hardcoded `Avg: ` / `Sum: `. All eleven aggregation kinds now take their prefix from `grid.summary.*`, and the label/value join is its own key rather than a `': '` baked into the renderer — the separator is translatable content, so zh sets a fullwidth colon and fr the French space-before-colon. The numbers are untouched. The form dialog's `sr-only` description fallback joins the packs too; it is clipped, not visible, so the only way an app could displace it was to author a `description` and thereby put a visible subtitle on every dialog.

  **The Settings namespace screen converts as one unit.** `SettingsView` routed zero framing copy through i18n — save/failure toasts, the env-lock and crypto refusals, the load-error card, the empty-route state, the navigation buttons, the unsaved-changes save bar — while its immediate sibling `SettingsHub`, in the same directory, resolved everything through `t('console.settingsHub.*')`. A zh-CN admin read correctly translated field labels sitting inside an English save bar, because `useSettingsLabel` translates a namespace's authored content but reaches none of the chrome around it. All of it now resolves through a `console.settingsView.*` namespace placed beside the hub's, including the crypto-refusal strings that objectui#4579 deliberately left in English rather than leave one translated string among a dozen literals.

  The save-bar counter was an English plural rule executing in every locale (`change` plus an `s` when the count exceeds one). It is now a real i18next plural family — base key plus `_one` and `_other` in all ten packs — not the `(s)` spelling translated nine ways. The base key is the load-bearing part: i18next asks `Intl.PluralRules` for the one suffix a language needs and, finding no such slot, falls back to English, so without it Russian would read English at counts 2-20 and Arabic at 2-99. Russian and Arabic take the "noun: {count}" form their packs already use for this exact reason, and the counter is verified rendering in-language at 1, 2 and 5.

  The Beta badge reuses the hub's existing key rather than minting a twin, and the refusal messages interpolate their subject through the bundle instead of concatenating a translated word onto an English prefix.

- c32a8a1: `richtext` fields are placed like the long-form fields they are — four layout sets stopped spelling the type three ways the spec rejects

  `@objectstack/spec` spells the WYSIWYG type `richtext`, one word, and **rejects** `rich_text` and `rich-text`: both exist only as typo keys in the spec's own `suggestFieldType` table, so `FieldSchema` refuses a field declared with either. Four sets that place fields by matching the RAW type string carried nothing else — `SKIP_TYPES` in the related list spelled it `rich_text`, both `WIDE_FIELD_TYPES` and `SECONDARY_FIELD_TYPES` spelled it `rich-text` — so each set was inert for the only spelling a producer can emit, and every one of them named the type it was failing to handle.

  For a real `richtext` field that meant: it was auto-derived into a related-list column, it never spanned the full row in a multi-column detail section or form (unlike `markdown` and `html` sitting right beside it in the same sets), and it stayed in the dense primary section of the record page instead of dropping into "More details". All four move together — half of them would have left the detail page and the form disagreeing about the same field, which is worse than the uniform gap.

  The dead spellings are dropped rather than kept alongside the live one: the alias table is the single place aliases belong, and a set that carries both invites the next drift. The pins are derived from the spec's own `FieldType` vocabulary instead of enumerated, so a member that stops being a real type name fails by name — replacing an assertion that was green only because the set contained the string it asked about.

  `markdown` joins `richtext` and `html` in the related list's `SKIP_TYPES`, on a measurement rather than on the assumption that it renders raw. It does not: markdown and richtext both render through `MarkdownCellRenderer`, formatted and sanitized. The reason none of the three works in a table is that the formatted output is block-level — a heading, paragraphs, a list — inside a single-line truncating cell, so a document shows as one clipped heading with the rest invisible. `textarea` stays derived for the same reason read the other way: it renders as plain truncated text, which is a useful column. Author-declared columns are untouched — this set only filters the zero-config auto-derive walk.

## 17.4.0

### Minor Changes

- ecae400: Retire the `capability-multiselect` field widget name, which existed only on the docs-site registration path and which nothing ever stamped (objectui#3308, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove)

  `field:capability-multiselect` was registered by `registerFields()` and only there. That function's sole caller is the docs site, so the key never existed on the live path (`registerAllFields()`, run at module import, iterates `fieldWidgetMap` — which never listed it). A field authored with `widget: 'capability-multiselect'` therefore resolved to nothing in every real application, while the comment above the registration described it as usable from a record form: a code comment promising a capability that does not exist, which is the worst direction for a metadata renderer AI-authored apps read as authority.

  Nothing stamped the hint either. ADR-0056 P1 stamps `permission-facet-link` on all six `sys_permission_set` facets — `system_permissions` included — through the single `ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema` choke point, and P2 put the capability editor in Studio. The widget name was a leftover from an intermediate iteration of that rollout.

  Removed, with a tombstone at each site:

  - `@object-ui/fields` — the `field:capability-multiselect` registration and the comment that advertised it. **Breaking in name only**: the key was unreachable outside the docs site, so no application could have resolved it. A field still carrying the hint now degrades to its declared `type` renderer, the defined behavior for an unregistered widget.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail` — `InlineFieldInput`'s `widget === 'capability-multiselect'` branch, the hint's last honoring surface. Leaving one consumer for a name no producer emits and no form resolves is the same declared-vs-enforced split, inverted. The sibling `permission-facet-link` branch is untouched and pinned.
  - `@object-ui/components` — the dead `capability-multiselect` entry in the form renderer's `DATA_SOURCE_FIELD_TYPES` set, which could never match a resolvable widget.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-form` — a comment naming `capability-multiselect` as the widget stamped onto `sys_permission_set.system_permissions`; it names `permission-facet-link` now, which is what is actually stamped.

  `CapabilityMultiSelectField` itself is **unchanged and still exported**: Studio's `PermissionMatrixEditor` imports and renders it directly, which is ADR-0056 P2's design. Only the widget name is retired — the component is not a registry field widget and its doc comment now says so.

  `registerFields()` is also **kept**, with its `@deprecated Use registerAllFields() instead` note corrected. The two are not interchangeable: it registers `createFieldRenderer(widget)`, which synthesizes the label, description and the local `value`/`onChange` state that lets a bare field node (`{ type: 'currency', label: 'Amount' }`) render standalone in the docs demos. Retiring it needs a decision about where that demo chrome goes; the note now records that instead of implying a drop-in replacement.

- 1bd6faa: fix(fields,plugin-form): stop the inline child grid from collapsing `datetime`/`time` columns onto the `date` control

  `deriveMasterDetail`'s `fieldTypeToColumnType` mapped `date`, `datetime` and `time` onto the single `date` grid column type, and `GridField` renders that as `<input type="date">`. The consequence was not cosmetic: that control emits a bare `YYYY-MM-DD` on change, so a user who merely re-picked the **day** of a `datetime` cell silently wrote the record's time component out of existence — a `14:30` became midnight with no warning and no undo.

  `GridColumn['type']` now carries `'datetime'` and `'time'` alongside `'date'`, and each renders its own control with its own read/write adapter:

  - `datetime` → `<input type="datetime-local">`, read through `toDateTimeInputValue` and written back through `fromDateTimeInputValue`, so the stored shape stays ISO-8601 and read and write share one basis (the contract `DateTimeField` already follows, objectui#3127).
  - `time` → `<input type="time">`, round-tripping the stored zone-less `HH:mm[:ss]` verbatim.
  - `date` → unchanged.

  The read-only surfaces are fixed with it. `displayText()` and the read-only table both fell through to `String(value)` and printed the raw stored ISO on screen (`2026-06-17T00:00:00.000Z`); each temporal type now formats as itself — a day for `date`, day + local time for `datetime`, the wall clock for `time`. That could not be fixed before the type collapse was undone, because with one column type the renderer had no way to know which of the two to show.

  Authors writing explicit grid `columns` can now declare `type: 'datetime'` / `type: 'time'`; previously those spellings were not part of the exported union.

### Patch Changes

- 8497579: A required field whose `defaultValue` is a runtime token is submittable from a create form

  `@objectstack/spec` lets a field's `defaultValue` be a runtime _instruction_
  rather than a value — the `DEFAULT_VALUE_TOKENS` family (`'NOW()'`,
  `'current_user'`) or a CEL Expression envelope. The server resolves those per
  insert, in `ObjectQL.applyFieldDefaults`, for any field that arrives absent or
  null, which is why a create form must leave them empty: seeding the literal text
  `NOW()` into a datetime input and submitting it suppresses the very resolution
  the declaration asked for.

  Correct for an optional field. Combined with `required: true` it deadlocked:

  ```ts
  remind_at: Field.datetime({ required: true, defaultValue: 'NOW()' }),
  ```

  the control opened empty, the client-side required rule refused the submit, and
  there was nothing sensible for the user to type — the declaration had already
  said what the value is, and omitting the field is exactly what makes the server
  supply it. Same shape as the `required` + static-default case, one layer down.

  In **create** mode a runtime `defaultValue` now suppresses the client-side
  `required` rule, and the field is omitted from the payload. The producer
  guarantees the value at insert, so the field is not "missing" — it is
  server-owned. `required: true` alongside a runtime default is coherent authoring
  (storage-level required, producer-guaranteed), not an authoring error.

  Both halves matter. Suppressing the rule alone would have been half an answer: a
  rendered control registers with the form whether or not anything seeded it, so
  an untouched runtime-default field still reached the payload as `undefined` — or
  as `''` once anything focused it. `undefined` is invisible to a
  `JSON.stringify` inspection while remaining a KEY a data source may translate
  into an explicit column write, and `''` is neither absent nor null, so it stores
  a blank and defeats the declaration outright.

  Three boundaries came with it, each pinned in both directions:

  - **Create only.** An edit form shows a persisted row, where the token was
    resolved at insert; blanking a required column there is a real removal and is
    still refused.
  - **Runtime defaults only.** A static literal default _is_ seeded into the
    control, so if the user clears it they have removed a value that was really
    there — `required` still fires.
  - **The rule, not the field.** A value the user does type is submitted normally
    and outranks the declared default. Only the "must not be empty" check is
    suppressed.

  Seeding and this rule read ONE predicate (`isRuntimeDefault`), so a form can
  never seed a field it also refuses to submit. The suppression also drops the
  required marker and `aria-required` for that field in create mode, since both
  are driven by the same boolean — the honest reading, as the user really is not
  required to provide the value. Surfacing what the server _will_ supply, as a
  non-authoritative preview, is a separate follow-up.

  Not extended to `requiredWhen` (the conditional-required CEL rule), which is
  resolved downstream in the form renderer against the live record.

- f0c9a90: Create forms now open with the object schema's declared `defaultValue`s

  A field declared `required: true, defaultValue: 'draft'` opened the console's
  create dialog with an empty select and a required marker: the user had to pick a
  value the system already knew, with every neighbouring option — some with side
  effects — one click away. `defaultValue` + `required` produced the worst create
  experience of any modelling choice, strictly worse than declaring no default.

  The server was never the problem. Omitting the field from a create request
  stores the declared default, because `ObjectQL.applyFieldDefaults` resolves it on
  insert. The gap was container-side: `ObjectForm` seeded its opening values from
  the object schema, and the five other object-form containers did not — their
  create branch set the form data to `initialData || initialValues || {}` and never
  looked at the schema. The console's create dialog is the global `<ModalForm>`,
  one of those five. Modal, Drawer, Tabbed, Split and Wizard now seed through one
  shared module (`schemaDefaults`), so a create form opens preselected and
  submittable.

  Three boundaries came with it, each pinned in both directions:

  - **Create only.** An edit form shows a persisted row as the server holds it.
    `ObjectForm`'s pass had been running in every mode, so a column the record
    leaves unset showed the default — arming a silent write of a value the user
    never chose on the next save of any other field. It is now gated on the same
    "no persisted record" test the data-fetch effect uses.
  - **Static defaults only.** A `defaultValue` may be an instruction the server
    resolves per insert — the `NOW()` / `current_user` runtime tokens
    (`DEFAULT_VALUE_TOKENS`) or a CEL Expression envelope. `ObjectForm` had been
    seeding those verbatim, which put the literal text `NOW()` into a datetime
    input and then submitted it as the field's value, suppressing the very
    resolution the declaration asked for (`applyFieldDefaults` only fills fields
    that arrive empty). Those are now left empty for the server.
  - **Callers still win.** `initialData` / `initialValues` outrank a schema
    default — a lookup prefill or a duplicate-record seed is the more specific
    instruction.

  Only the field-level `defaultValue` is honoured, not a select option's
  `default: true`, even though `@objectstack/spec`'s `SelectOptionSchema` declares
  that key: the insert path resolves `defaultValue` and nothing else, so seeding
  from option-level `default` would preselect values the server would never have
  applied — a UI-only second default contract.

- 5bfaabd: `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` now reaches every object-bound block, not just
  `list-view` — and `element:record_picker` stops discarding `view`
  (objectstack#6953).

  objectstack#5576 wired the spec's per-element data binding
  (`dataSource: { object, view?, filter?, sort?, limit? }`) to `list-view` and left
  the same declaration inert on every other page component. Two gaps remained, and
  both were silent:

  - **`element:record_picker` read four of the five keys and dropped `view`.** So
    `dataSource: { object: 'account', view: 'hot' }` — the spec's own example —
    built a picker over EVERY account instead of the rows the saved view selects.
    Nothing threw and nothing rendered an error; the option list was simply wider
    than what was authored, which also means a user could select a record the page
    said was out of scope.
  - **`object-grid` / `object-form` / `object-kanban` / `object-calendar` /
    `object-chart` / `object-metric` / `record:related_list` read none of it.**
    Each gates its fetch on its own `objectName`, and nothing mapped
    `dataSource.object` onto it, so a page written the way the spec documents
    rendered an empty grid / a field-less form / a board with no cards / an empty
    month / an empty chart / a static metric number — with no request and no
    diagnostic anywhere. Spec-valid metadata rendering nothing is the
    objectstack#4413 shape.

  Composition follows objectstack#5576's landed semantics unchanged on every block:
  a named saved view supplies the baseline, a key written on the component itself
  overrides it, an explicit binding key overrides both, `filter` AND-combines
  ("additional filter criteria" — a binding can narrow a view, never widen it), and
  a `view` name that does not resolve renders a configuration error instead of
  degrading to the object's full scope.

  - `@object-ui/react` — new `useElementDataSourceSchema(schema, mapping, dataSource?)`
    and `ElementDataSourceGate` apply a resolved binding to the schema keys a given
    block reads, plus `ElementDataSourceErrorPanel` / `ElementDataSourceLoadingPanel`
    for the two non-final states. One precedence table for all blocks rather than
    one copy per block — that copy is how "additional filter criteria" would have
    become two dialects.
  - A mapping names **only** keys its block genuinely reads. A composed value
    written onto a key the block ignores would be accepted and dropped, which is
    the defect being removed, one layer deeper — so a kanban's swimlane `columns`
    never receive a view's field list, and a block with no row cap leaves `limit`
    unmapped. The per-block coverage table, including two residual gaps that are
    named rather than papered over, is in `content/docs/guide/data-source.md`.

  No behaviour changes for a block that carries no `dataSource`: the binding-free
  path returns the schema by reference, so nothing remounts and nothing refetches.

- 022002a: `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` now reaches the remaining object-bound public
  blocks: `object-gantt` / `object-timeline` / `object-map` / `object-pivot` /
  `object-master-detail-form` / `embeddable-form` / `record:line_items`
  (objectstack#7121).

  objectstack#6953 wired the spec's per-element data binding
  (`dataSource: { object, view?, filter?, sort?, limit? }`) to the eight blocks it
  named and left the same declaration inert on these seven. Each gates its fetch on
  its own object key and nothing mapped `dataSource.object` onto it, so a page
  written the way the spec documents rendered an empty gantt / an empty timeline
  rail / a map with no markers / an empty cross-tab / a field-less form — with no
  request and no diagnostic anywhere. Spec-valid metadata rendering nothing is the
  objectstack#4413 shape.

  Composition follows objectstack#5576's landed semantics unchanged, through the
  shared `ElementDataSourceGate` (no change to it or to the resolution layer): a
  named saved view supplies the baseline, a key written on the component itself
  overrides it, an explicit binding key overrides both, `filter` AND-combines
  ("additional filter criteria" — a binding can narrow a view, never widen it), and
  a `view` name that does not resolve renders a configuration error on every one of
  these blocks instead of degrading to the object's full scope.

  Each block maps **only** the keys it genuinely reads, which for this batch means
  several keys stay deliberately unmapped rather than being parked somewhere
  plausible:

  - `object-gantt` and `object-map` take `object` / `filter` / `sort`; neither has a
    row cap or a field-list read site.
  - `object-pivot` takes `object` / `filter`; a cross-tab orders itself by its own
    row/column grouping and cannot be computed over a truncated page.
  - `object-timeline` takes `object` only — its fetch is
    `find(objectName, { options: { $top: 100 } })`, with no filter/sort read site
    at all, so a named view is error-checked and then contributes nothing.
  - `embeddable-form` and `object-master-detail-form` take `object` only (the
    parent object, in the master-detail case); a form that writes one record has no
    collection query for `filter` / `sort` / `limit` to narrow.
  - `record:line_items` takes `object` onto **`childObject`** — the collection it
    actually lists — and nothing else: its query is the parent FK plus a fixed
    `$top: 500`, and its `columns` are editable `GridColumn` objects rather than a
    field-name projection a view could supply.

  The per-block coverage table, including every residual gap named above, is in
  `content/docs/guide/data-source.md`.

  No behaviour change for a block that carries no `dataSource`: the binding-free
  path returns the schema by reference, so nothing remounts and nothing refetches.

- 6d762da: The five locale keys behind #3546's eight no-fallback `t()` call sites are now defined in all ten packs, so the built-in-view toasts, the activity-timeline source link, the wizard's required-field toast and the Gantt refresh button's accessible name are translated instead of falling back to English — or, on two surfaces, to the key itself (part of #3546).

  `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` measured 258 keys that a `t()` call site asks for and no pack defines. These five were the subset with no working inline default: `console.objectView.cannotEditMetaView`, `console.objectView.cannotDeleteMetaView`, `detail.viewSource`, `gantt.toolbar.refresh` and `wizard.missingRequired`. Adding a `defaultValue` is deliberately not the fix — that mechanism is what kept all 258 invisible for months.

  **Two of the eight sites really did render the raw key**, and both go through a binding with nothing in front of i18next. `ObjectView.tsx` calls `useObjectTranslation()` directly, so five toasts read `console.objectView.cannotEditMetaView` / `cannotDeleteMetaView` on screen; the `|| 'Built-in views cannot be renamed.'` guards next to them were dead on every path, because i18next answers a miss with the key itself and a non-empty string never falls through `||`. Those four unreachable English strings are removed rather than repaired: one key served four call sites (rename / pin / set-as-default / configure), so the pack copy covers any change to a built-in view instead of naming one operation. `RecordActivityTimeline.tsx` fails the same way for a subtler reason — `useDetailTranslation` is `createSafeTranslation(..., 'detail.back')`, and because `detail.back` does resolve, the probe hands back i18next's `t` for every key and bypasses the defaults map wholesale, so `detail.viewSource` reached the user verbatim.

  **The other two sites were not rendering a raw key**, contrary to the issue's description, and are fixed here as the milder "English in all ten languages" class. `wizard.missingRequired` is its own hook's probe key, so the probe failed and `createSafeTranslation` correctly served its English default. `gantt.toolbar.refresh` goes through `useGanttTranslation`, which deliberately does not use `createSafeTranslation` and falls back per key — so the refresh button's `aria-label` was "Refresh", in English, never the key. Screen-reader users heard an English word rather than an identifier; a `zh` session now hears 刷新.

  Regression cover is provider-mounted on purpose: with no `I18nProvider` the defaults maps answer every one of these keys and the assertions pass while the console is broken, which is precisely the false-green the issue documents. For the two sites whose English output was already correct, `en` cannot discriminate before from after — the `zh` assertions are the ones that pin the fix.

- 11c1e71: Resolve a `select` field declared `multiple: true` to the `field:multiselect` widget, so the object form's visible label actually names the chip picker it renders (objectui#3986).

  `mapFieldTypeToFormType` keyed the widget id on the field's `type` string alone, so an object-schema `{ type: 'select', multiple: true }` picklist — a spec-legal, entirely ordinary shape — became `field:select`. `SelectField` then delegated to `MultiSelectField` on `config.multiple`, so the component that RENDERED was the chip picker while everything keyed on the widget id still answered for the single-value combobox. Above all the label-association declaration (`ComponentMeta.labelling`, objectui#3961), which the form renderer resolves per widget id: the host emitted `<label for>` at the chip row's wrapper `div`, where a `for` is inert — `HTMLLabelElement.control` returns `null`. Visually the field had a label; in the accessibility tree that label named nothing. Measured on the object-form path, `role=group` + accessible name went from 1 for a `multiselect`-typed field (fixed in objectui#3975) to 0 for this one.

  Declaring `select` itself `labelling: 'group'` was not available: a single-value select's trigger is a labelable `button[role=combobox]` whose `for` association works, and a bare `select` is a builtin the renderer resolves without consulting the registry at all. The fix is therefore at the producer — the widget id now carries the arity, so one place decides which widget renders and the declaration can no longer be addressed to a widget that is not rendering.

  - `mapFieldTypeToFormType(fieldType, config?)` takes an optional second argument — the rest of the field definition, of which only `multiple` is read. Existing single-argument calls are unchanged, and so is every type outside the new table: `select` is the only one whose `multiple` form is a different WIDGET. The spec's multi-capable set is larger (select / lookup / file / image, with `radio` on the select branch and `user` storing like `lookup`), but `LookupField`, `FileField` and `ImageField` each render both arities themselves, so their id — and their labelling declaration — is already right for either.
  - The four object-form producers pass the pair: `ObjectForm`, `DrawerForm`, `ModalForm`, and `sectionFields` (Tabbed / Wizard / Split / Drawer / Modal). In `sectionFields` the id is now computed once from the EFFECTIVE pair, after view-level overrides have merged, because `multiple` is itself a spec `FormField` key: a view restating only `multiple: true` over a single-value object field moves the widget too, and `multiple: false` moves it back.
  - `SelectField`'s `multiple` delegation is KEPT, not retired. Measured, it stays reachable from three entrances that never consult the alias map: the inline grid editor (`FieldEditWidget` finds `select` in its own table first), `ActionParamDialog` (`resolveFormWidgetType` returns `select` from `fieldWidgetMap` first), and hand-written SDUI addressing `field:select` by name with `multiple` on its metadata.

  Read-only rendering of these widgets is untouched (objectui#4005), as is the built-in `Select` branch (objectui#3976).

- 523be48: `object-timeline` and `record:line_items` now apply the filter / sort / row cap they are given, so a named `dataSource.view` narrows them instead of contributing nothing

  These were the two residual gaps in objectstack#7121's per-block coverage table
  (objectstack#7137). Both blocks are object-bound lists, both accepted the spec's
  per-element `dataSource` binding, and neither had a read site for `filter` or
  `sort` anywhere in its fetch:

  - `object-timeline`'s entire query was
    `find(objectName, { options: { $top: 100 } })`.
  - `record:line_items`' was the parent FK plus a fixed `$top: 500`.

  So `dataSource: { object, view: 'hot' }` resolved the view — a typo still reported
  a configuration error, it never degraded into an unfiltered query — and then
  dropped everything the view said. The rendered rows could be **wider than the view
  they named**, silently, which is exactly the class of mistake AI-authored metadata
  hides best: the page looks like it works. objectstack#7121 deliberately left the
  keys unmapped and recorded the gap rather than writing composed values onto schema
  keys nobody read; this closes it at the fetch instead.

  What each block now reads:

  - **`object-timeline`** — `$filter: schema.filter`,
    `$orderby: convertSortToQueryParams(schema.sort)`, and
    `$top: schema.limit ?? 100`, matching the form `object-gantt` / `object-map` /
    `object-calendar` already use. Its registry mapping gains
    `filter` / `sort` / `limit`; `columns` stays unmapped, because a timeline
    projects the fields its `timeline` config names.
  - **`record:line_items`** — the composed filter is **AND-combined** with the parent
    relationship condition through `mergeFilterNodes`, never substituted for it, the
    same way `record:related_list` composes its own since objectstack#7118: a
    line-items panel is always scoped to the record it sits on, so an _additional_
    criterion can only narrow this parent's children and can never surface another
    parent's rows. `sort` becomes the load order and `limit` the row cap (default
    500). `columns` stays unmapped — here they are `GridColumn[]` driving an editable
    grid, not a field-name projection, so a view's column list would be the wrong
    _shape_ rather than merely a wider answer.

  **Behaviour change worth knowing about:** the timeline's default window is now a
  real cap. `{ options: { $top: 100 } }` nested the limit under a key that is not a
  `QueryParams` field and that no adapter in this repo reads (`convertQueryParams`
  maps `params.$top`), so the intended window never reached the wire and a timeline
  over a large object fetched whatever the server chose to return. It is now sent as
  `$top`, and authorable via `limit` or a view's `pagination.pageSize`.

  `@object-ui/core` gains `convertSortToQueryParams`, the sort→`$orderby` lowering
  the three sibling blocks each inline privately. It is shared rather than copied
  twice more, and is slightly more faithful to the declared contract than those
  copies: a sort entry that omits `order` means ascending instead of being dropped
  (the string spelling `"amount"` already meant ascending in the same copies), and
  nothing orderable yields `undefined` rather than a truthy empty `{}`. Migrating
  the three existing copies onto it is objectstack#7148 and is not done here.

## 17.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f44d872: `mobile.fullscreenLongText` finally reaches auto-generated long-text fields, and
  `mobile_fullscreen` gets one declared carrier (objectui#3245).

  FROM: `ObjectForm` stamped the flag onto the FormField itself
  (`{ ...f, mobile_fullscreen: true }`). TO: it stamps the flag onto the object the
  form renderer will actually forward to the widget as `field` — `f.field || f`,
  resolved exactly the way `renderFieldComponent` resolves it.

  **The flag's only legal carrier is the field metadata, and its only producer is
  `ObjectForm`.** That convention was already what the widget side assumed after
  objectui#3232/#3233 (`TextAreaField` reads `field.mobile_fullscreen` and nothing
  else, and `field` is the single metadata carrier); the producer was writing to a
  different object, so for auto-generated fields the two never met.

  What was broken, end to end: `ObjectForm` builds an auto-generated field as
  `type: 'field:textarea'` **and** stashes the object-field metadata on `.field`.
  The renderer forwards `field: field.field || field`, so the widget received the
  raw metadata — which never carried the flag — while the FormField-level copy was
  dropped by `stripRegisteredFieldProps`. Every entry point into `TextAreaField`
  therefore read `undefined` and the expand affordance never rendered. Only the
  hand-authored `customFields` path (no `.field` to shadow the FormField) ever
  worked, i.e. the feature was dead on the path virtually every form takes. Unit
  tests on both ends passed the whole time, because the break lived in the seam
  between them; this release adds the feature's first integration coverage — real
  `ObjectForm` → real form renderer → real `TextAreaField`, no mocks — which fails
  against the old producer and passes against the new one.

  `mobile_fullscreen` is now declared on `@object-ui/types`' `BaseFieldMetadata`,
  hence on every member of the `FieldMetadata` union that
  `FieldWidgetComponentProps.field` resolves to. It is deliberately **not** an
  `@objectstack/spec` property: nobody authors it on a field definition, it is a
  projection of the form-level `ObjectFormSchema.mobile.fullscreenLongText` setting
  onto the field metadata at render time. Declaring it removes the last untyped
  end of the chain — the producer's `as FormField` cast is gone — so the two sides
  can now disagree out loud instead of silently.

  The hand-authored `customFields` path keeps working unchanged, and keeps its own
  metadata: the flag is stamped on the FormField only when there is no `.field` to
  carry it. Synthesizing a `field` object in that case would light the affordance
  up while quietly replacing the field's `rows` / `placeholder` with defaults — the
  regression test pins that too.

- 30ae33a: `RichTextField` honours `mobile_fullscreen`, so `mobile.fullscreenLongText` is
  finally true of rich text too (objectui#3301).

  `ObjectFormSchema.mobile.fullscreenLongText` has always been documented as
  "textarea/rich-text get an expand button", and `ObjectForm` has always stamped
  `mobile_fullscreen` onto `field:markdown` / `field:html` fields to deliver it.
  Both of those types resolve to `RichTextField`, and that widget never read the
  flag: a producer with no consumer. Turning the setting on gave a phone user an
  expand affordance on their textareas and nothing at all on their markdown or
  HTML fields, with nothing anywhere reporting that half the feature was inert.

  FROM: `RichTextField` ignored the flag entirely (`grep fullscreen` over that
  file returned nothing). TO: it reads `field.mobile_fullscreen` — the same single
  metadata carrier `TextAreaField` reads, and nowhere else — and renders the same
  expand affordance and full-height editing dialog.

  **The affordance now has one implementation, not two.** One form-level setting
  should produce one behaviour, so the expand button, the dialog and the
  draft/commit semantics moved into a shared `FullscreenFieldEditor` that both
  widgets render; only the EDITOR is per-widget. A second hand-written copy of
  that state machine would be the same defect this release fixes, with an extra
  step — it drifts, and nothing reports the drift. The rich-text dialog hosts the
  widget's real editing surface (same format indicator, same editor), not a bare
  textarea, so whatever that editor grows into, both positions get it at once.

  Behaviour is identical across the two widgets and unchanged for
  `TextAreaField`: the dialog seeds its draft from the committed value at open
  time, keeps typing local (a react-hook-form field is not marked dirty by an
  edit the user may still cancel), commits once on "Done", and discards on
  "Cancel". Test ids follow the existing convention per widget —
  `richtext-fullscreen-toggle` / `-dialog` / `-input` / `-save` alongside the
  `textarea-*` ones, since a single form can contain both.

  There is deliberately no prop spelling of the flag and no `??` fallback chain in
  either widget. The field metadata is the one carrier (objectui#3233), so a
  misspelled or misplaced flag stays inert and visible rather than being quietly
  caught by a tolerant consumer.

  Also removes a dead type from the producer: `ObjectForm` stamped the flag on
  `'string-multiline'`, a string that `grep -rn` finds exactly once across both
  this repo and `objectstack` — that line itself. No producer emitted it, no
  registry key matched it, no widget read it. The remaining four stamped types
  (`textarea`, `field:textarea`, `field:markdown`, `field:html`) each have a real
  reader.

### Patch Changes

- a4cff5b: Conditional-rule predicates that fail to evaluate are no longer silent
  (objectstack#5149, appeal 2). `evalFieldPredicate` — the canonical funnel for
  `visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen`, view-level `visibleOn`, legacy
  `condition`, per-option `visibleWhen`, screen-field predicates and list
  conditional formatting — now logs **one `console.warn` per predicate text**
  when evaluation fails (parse error, unbound identifier, engine fault), carrying
  the predicate source, the engine's failure reason, and the field/rule locator
  the call site provides. Renderer call sites thread that locator
  (`visibleWhen of field 'amount'`), so a broken predicate identifies itself in
  the browser console instead of being indistinguishable from an absent one.

  Verdicts are unchanged: evaluation still fails open to the caller's safe
  default (flipping that default is objectstack#5149 appeal 1, tracked
  separately). Fault-probing callers (`evalRowPredicate`'s fail-closed path,
  `ExpressionEvaluator`'s `throwOnError`) opt out via the new
  `diagnostic.warn: false` and keep their own single diagnostic, so no broken
  predicate ever warns twice.

## 17.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a51e77: Stop declaring 14 symbols across ten packages under names `@objectstack/spec`
  owns (objectui#3161, objectstack#4115 batch 7 — the long tail, one or two
  entries per package). All ten packages leave the ledger, which drops from 17
  collisions across 11 packages to 3 across 1.

  **Renamed exports** — in every case the spec exports the same name for a
  _different_ thing, so the old name was a mis-description rather than a dialect:

  `ManifestValidationResult` follows the `<what was validated>Validation<Error|Result>`
  convention registered on objectstack#4115 (`@object-ui/core` took
  `SchemaNodeValidationResult` in batch 4). `PageHeaderComponentProps` deliberately
  reuses the name `@object-ui/app-shell` already chose for its own header props in
  batch 3, so one concept does not acquire two dialect names one package apart.

  **Now derived from the spec instead of hand-written:**

  - `@object-ui/fields` — `isFileIdToken` is re-exported from
    `@objectstack/spec/data`. The local copy was character-for-character identical
    to the spec's function while its comment said it "mirrors" it, so every
    behaviour test passed and only reference identity could tell the two apart.
    The regex is a wire decision: widening it server-side while a copy here kept
    the old bound would make every new id read as "not a reference", and the
    widget would submit the legacy inline blob to a backend expecting a reference.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail` — `FeedFilterMode` is re-exported from
    `@objectstack/spec/data`, in a file that already imported the sibling
    `FeedItemType` from the spec.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-grid` — the eleven-member aggregation union is now the
    spec's `ColumnSummary` enum, so the total `Record<ColumnSummaryType, string>`
    label map turns a member the spec adds into a compile error instead of a
    blank footer cell. `ColumnSummarySetting` is `NonNullable<ListColumn['summary']>`,
    i.e. whatever forms the spec itself accepts. `hasMultiValueShape` delegates to
    the spec's `isMultiValueField` rather than re-deriving it from
    `MULTI_OPTION_TYPES` / `MULTI_CAPABLE_TYPES`.
  - `@object-ui/providers` — `ThemePreference` is the spec's `ThemeMode` union
    plus the one legacy `'system'` spelling this provider still honours for stored
    preferences, read off the schema's own `_zod` carrier so the package takes no
    zod dependency.

  `@objectstack/spec` moves from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in
  `@object-ui/fields` (it re-exports a runtime function) and `@object-ui/providers`
  (its public `.d.ts` now references the spec).

  Scored `minor`, not `major`, per this repo's fixed-group rule — objectui's major
  tracks `@objectstack`, so breaking changes of our own ship as minor with the
  semantics spelled out above (see AGENTS.md §版本号策略). A `major` here would carry
  all 39 packages of the fixed group to `18.0.0` and off objectstack's 17.x line.

### Patch Changes

- 335041c: Stop declaring 13 `@object-ui/core` symbols under names `@objectstack/spec` owns
  (objectui#3158, objectstack#4115 batch 4).

  **Breaking for importers of `@object-ui/core`** — seven exported names changed,
  because the spec exports the same name for a _different_ thing:

  | was                      | now                               | what the spec's same-named export actually is                                |
  | :----------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `ChartSeries`            | `ChartSeriesBinding`              | the authored dataset-binding descriptor (a measure `name`, no `data`)        |
  | `ActionHandler`          | `ActionRunnerHandler`             | the SERVER-side objectql handler, `(ctx) => unknown`                         |
  | `PluginDefinition`       | `RegistryPluginDefinition`        | the platform PACKAGE manifest (`id`/`slug`/`staticPath`/install hooks)       |
  | `ValidationError`        | `SchemaNodeValidationError`       | plugin-manifest validation, keyed by `field`, no severity                    |
  | `ValidationResult`       | `SchemaNodeValidationResult`      | ditto, with both arrays optional                                             |
  | `defineView`             | `defineSystemView`                | the VIEW-DOCUMENT factory: parses a `ViewSchema`, returns a validated `View` |
  | `resolveCrudAffordances` | `resolveEffectiveCrudAffordances` | the object-level affordance matrix, with no notion of server API operations  |

  The other six keep their names and are now **imported from the spec** instead of
  re-declared: `StyleMap`, `ResponsiveStyles` (ADR-0065), `RowHeight`,
  `CONTEXT_TOKENS`, `CrudAffordances`, `RowCrudPredicates`.

  **The copies were live misdescriptions, not just duplicates.** Three said so in
  their own comments:

  - `CONTEXT_TOKENS` carried a note that the duplication was "temporary until the
    next coordinated release… because the installed `@objectstack/spec` predates
    that export". The installed spec (17.0.0-rc.0) exports it, and the copy was
    byte-identical — so it passed every value comparison and every behavioural
    test for the whole interval in which its stated reason was false.
  - `RowHeight` advertised itself as "the spec's `RowHeightSchema` vocabulary"
    while being a hand-written union. It happened to be correct; nothing would
    have caught the day it stopped being.
  - `managedBy.ts` described itself as a "UI-side mirror of the framework's
    `resolveCrudAffordances()`" and carried its own `DEFAULTS` table — a
    line-for-line copy of the spec's `CRUD_AFFORDANCE_DEFAULTS`, plus a copy of
    its override parser.

  `resolveEffectiveCrudAffordances` now **delegates** the bucket/`userActions` half
  to the spec's `resolveCrudAffordances()`, so the bucket table has exactly one
  definition on the platform. What stays objectui's is the part the spec has no
  notion of: intersecting that matrix with the server-resolved effective API
  operation set (#3391), so the UI never offers a button the server would 405 —
  and the name now says that instead of claiming to be the spec's function.

  Deriving `RowCrudPredicates` also **tightens** it: the local copy typed
  `visibleWhen`/`disabledWhen` as `unknown`, where the spec types them as
  `Expression | ExpressionInput`. That was imprecision, not a deliberate dialect.

- 5eaa861: `list-view` and `embeddable-form` get a data source on the registry path — their required `objectName` was binding to nothing (#3144).

  `SchemaRenderer` puts the data source on `SchemaRendererContext` and **never** injects it into
  component props. A component that reads `props.dataSource` therefore needs its registration to
  bridge the two. `object-form`, `object-kanban` and `object-calendar` each register a small
  renderer that does exactly that. These two did not:

  - `list-view` (and its `view:list` alias) registered the bare `ListView`, which reads
    `props.dataSource` — so its `getObjectSchema` effect returned immediately, nothing was ever
    fetched, and it rendered the `empty-state` "Nothing here".
  - `embeddable-form`'s renderer was `({ schema }) => <EmbeddableForm config={schema} />`, dropping
    the context entirely — so the read-only source it derives for its inner `ObjectForm` was never
    built, and its submit path (`if (dataSource) await dataSource.create(...)`) had nothing to call.

  Both declare `objectName` **required** in their registry `inputs`. A binding the protocol obliges
  an author to supply, that nothing on that path can consume, is objectstack#4413's shape one layer
  up — and the reason it went unnoticed is that the console never takes this path: it reaches
  ListView through `ObjectView`'s `renderListView` render-prop, which passes a data source itself.
  Broken on the registry/SDUI path, which is the path `sdui.manifest.json` describes and a
  `kind:'react'` page walks.

  Found by `apps/console/src/__tests__/public-block-binding-reach.test.tsx` (objectstack#4472), not
  by hand — that suite mounts every public block declaring an `objectName` under a recording
  `dataSource` and asserts the binding arrives. Its ledger carried these two as named debt; with the
  bridge in place the ledger's both-directions assertion **failed until the entries were deleted**,
  which is the mechanism working as designed. Only `record:related_list` remains, and legitimately
  (it needs a parent record id from `RecordContext` before it may fetch).

  An explicit `dataSource` prop still wins, so hosts passing their own are unaffected, and
  `ListViewRenderer` forwards refs so `ListViewHandle` still works through the registry.

- a8ad6c0: A required boolean must be savable in its UNCHECKED state — `false` and `0` are values.

  Reported against an AI-built task tracker whose 任务 object has a required
  `是否完成` boolean: the create form showed the switch OFF, answered "是否完成不能
  为空", and saved instantly once the switch was turned ON. The app could only ever
  create ALREADY-DONE tasks — the one state the control shows by default was the
  one value it refused to save (cloud#972).

  Two defects stacked, and either alone is enough to break it:

  **The `required` verdict read truthiness, not presence.** `@objectstack/spec`
  FieldSchema.required (ADR-0113) is "an insert must provide a NON-NULL value",
  and objectql's record validator implements exactly that. react-hook-form's
  built-in rule instead fails whenever `isBoolean(value) && !value` — its
  accept-the-terms checkbox heritage — silently redefining every required boolean
  as "must be TRUE", including a select whose chosen option value is `false`. It
  also disagreed the other way, letting a whitespace-only string through for the
  server to reject with a 400. The form renderer no longer hands RHF its own
  `required`: the check is now a `validate` entry keyed `required` (so the error
  still surfaces as `type: 'required'`, which the conditional-required cleanup
  keys on) backed by a new shared `isMissingForRequired` in `@object-ui/core`, a
  deliberate mirror of objectql `record-validator.isMissing` — `undefined`,
  `null`, blank-after-trim string, empty array. Deleting the inherited rule also
  stops a `required` that rode in on `validation` from outliving a `requiredWhen`
  that resolved to FALSE.

  **A boolean field held `undefined` while displaying "off".** A two-state control
  has no third state, but a field with no entry in `defaultValues` rendered an OFF
  switch backed by nothing: the create payload omitted the column (it lands null,
  which reads as unchecked but isn't) and the presence check above would still
  refuse it. The form renderer now folds `false` into `defaultValues` for every
  boolean-widget field the caller left unset — in `defaultValues` itself, not
  per-Controller, because that object is also the dirty-check baseline and what
  the defaults-reset window replays. Every surface gets it, including the
  modal/drawer create dialogs that start from a bare `{}`. An authored default
  (or a loaded record, `null` included) still wins.

  `WizardForm`'s cross-step gate had its own copy of the empty-value predicate; it
  now imports the shared one so it cannot drift from the per-field verdict. And
  the field-demo renderer read `schema.defaultValue || schema.value`, throwing
  away an authored default of `false` / `0` / `''` — same falsy-as-empty class,
  now `??`.

  Verified end to end on a local stack against the exact metadata shape
  `apply_blueprint` materializes (`{ type: 'boolean', required: true }`, no
  default): a 是否完成 = 否 task with 工时 = 0 now creates and persists as
  `{ hours: 0, is_done: false }`, turning the switch on still stores `true`, and a
  blank required text is still refused.

## 17.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 38ca8be: refactor(fields): `requiredWhen` is the only required-predicate slot — drop the retired `conditionalRequired` alias

  `@objectstack/spec` 17 (objectstack#3855) **retired** `Field.conditionalRequired`,
  the long-deprecated alias of `requiredWhen`. ObjectUI carried a back-compat read
  for it in seven places; all of them are removed.

  The removal is safe because the spec did not merely _stop emitting_ the key — it
  made authoring it **fail loudly**. `retiredKey()` declares the key as
  `z.never()`, so:

  - `z.input` types it as `never` — writing it is a `tsc` error at the authoring site;
  - the parse **rejects** it (verified against `17.0.0-rc.0`), at both `FieldSchema`
    and `ObjectSchema`, with the prescription as the message:

    > `conditionalRequired` was removed in @objectstack/spec 17 (#3855) — use
    > `requiredWhen`. Rename the key; the value (a CEL predicate) is unchanged.
    > Run `os migrate meta --from 16` to rewrite it automatically.

  So spec-parsed metadata cannot carry the key — an object declaring it fails to
  load rather than loading with the rule silently dropped. Keeping a renderer-side
  `requiredWhen ?? conditionalRequired` would have re-created exactly the second
  de-facto contract the tombstone exists to prevent: the key would have kept
  working in the UI while being rejected everywhere else, hiding the producer's bug
  (AGENTS.md #0.1). "Backend-agnostic" (#1) does not argue for keeping it either —
  `conditionalRequired` is an ObjectStack-spec-ism, so the only producers that ever
  emit it are ObjectStack producers on ≤16, and the spec ships them a converter.

  Removed from:

  | package                  | site                                                                                                      |
  | :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `@object-ui/types`       | the `conditionalRequired?:` member on `FormField`                                                         |
  | `@object-ui/core`        | the `??` fallback + rules-param member in `resolveFieldRuleState`                                         |
  | `@object-ui/components`  | three pass-throughs in the form renderer                                                                  |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-form` | `ObjectForm`, `ModalForm`, `sectionFields`, `deriveMasterDetail` (×2)                                     |
  | `@object-ui/app-shell`   | the field inspector's legacy read/auto-migrate, and the key's entry in `clientValidation`'s CEL lint list |

  **Studio authors lose nothing.** The object designer's draft validation parses
  against the spec's own `ObjectSchema`, so a draft carrying the key now surfaces
  the tombstone's rename prescription under the same `fields.<name>.conditionalRequired`
  path the CEL lint used to report — a better message than the inspector's silent
  auto-migration, and one the server agrees with. That behavior is pinned by a test.

  **Migrating:** rename the key to `requiredWhen` (the CEL value is unchanged), or
  run `os migrate meta --from 16`.

- 03bd53b: feat(form): `SplitForm` honours the spec's new `FormSection.pane`

  A split form's panel assignment was a hardcoded positional rule — first section
  left, everything else right. The rule was invisible in the metadata, so
  reordering sections silently moved them across the divider, and an author could
  not place two sections in the left pane at all.

  Sections now declare their panel: `pane: 'primary' | 'secondary'`
  (@objectstack/spec `FormSection.pane`, objectstack#4160). Placement follows the
  key, not the array position — reordering paned sections never changes the
  layout. Omitted keys keep the exact legacy rule (first section `primary`, rest
  `secondary`), so existing metadata renders unchanged.

  `ObjectForm`'s split dispatch copies the key through its per-key section mapping
  (the path that once silently dropped `visibleOn`), and `ObjectFormSection`
  declares it. The spec side rejects `pane` on non-split form types at parse, so
  the key can never be an accepted-but-ignored no-op.

### Patch Changes

- 7639a61: fix(form): the spec↔runtime form-field chokepoint stops dropping spec 17 vocabulary, and the validator stops contradicting the renderer — #3090

  `normalizeSectionField` — the one translation point between the spec's authored
  form-field shape (`field` = object-field reference) and the runtime shape
  (`name` = data path) — silently dropped four spec keys, worst of all the
  ADR-0089 **canonical** `visibleWhen` spelling while the deprecated `visibleOn`
  worked. Now:

  - view-level `visibleWhen` routes into the view-level slot (`visibleOn`) so it
    ANDs with the object-level rule instead of clobbering it, and the wizard's
    final-submit gate folds the same slot into its verdict (before, a required
    field the view itself hides could block submission from off-screen);
  - `dependsOn`, `keyField`, and `disclosure` carry through;
  - a behavioral parity gate walks the spec `FormFieldSchema` key set — a key the
    spec adds fails as unmapped, a key it retires fails as stale.

  `SelectOptionSchema` is now derived from `@objectstack/spec/data` by reference
  (it used to strip `color` — which `@object-ui/fields` renders — plus `default`
  and the per-option `visibleWhen` gate), with pinned divergences (`value`
  widened for UI forms, `visibleWhen` on the #2212 wire contract) and documented
  UI-only extensions (`disabled`, `icon`). `SelectOption` (TS) gains `color` and
  `default`.

  `FormFieldSchema` (the runtime vocabulary `objectui validate` enforces) now
  covers every key the `FormField` interface declares — `widget`, `dependsOn`,
  `hidden`, `readonly`, `visibleOn`/`visibleWhen`/`readonlyWhen`/`requiredWhen`,
  `span` — and `type` is optional, matching the interface. A typo'd predicate now
  fails loudly instead of being stripped; spec-shape fields (`{ field: … }`) are
  still rejected, pinning the two-layer boundary.

- 94e63ef: fix(form): the runtime `field` metadata slot is declared instead of smuggled, and importing the spec's FormField is a lint error — #3090

  `FormField.field` — the slot where object-bound form paths stash the resolved
  field-metadata **object** for widgets — rode through the index signature,
  undeclared, readable only via `as any`. Same key, different layer: in the spec
  form-view vocabulary `field` is a _string_ (the referenced object-field name),
  and the undeclared slot kept that pun latent. The slot is now declared
  (`field?: Record<string, any>`) with the invariant in its JSDoc: on a runtime
  FormField it is never a string — the authored string form ends at the
  `normalizeSectionField` chokepoint, and a tripwire test pins that across all
  three input shapes. Assigning a string is now a compile error; the `as any`
  casts at the read sites are gone.

  A `no-restricted-imports` tripwire bans importing `FormField`/
  `FormFieldSchema` from `@objectstack/spec/ui` inside this repo: the spec's
  FormField TYPE erases to `any` in its dist (objectstack#4171), so the
  misimport silently deletes type safety — tsc says nothing. The lint message
  names the two layers and the correct import. The drift-guard parity test is
  the one legitimate importer, exempted inline with its reason.

  Ledger: `FormField` and `FormFieldSchema` move from untriaged DEBT to ALLOW
  with the two-layer rationale written down (122 → 120).

- aeb0bd2: fix(form): a tabbed/split form honours the form view's own `columns`

  `FormView.columns` is a spec key, but only `ObjectForm`'s simple path and
  `ModalForm` read it. `TabbedForm` and `SplitForm` derived the grid width from the
  per-section `columns` alone, so a view declaring `columns: 3` rendered 3 columns
  in a modal and **single-column** as a tab or split — the same metadata laying out
  differently depending on which host picked it up.

  Both now resolve the grid the way the other hosts already did:

      explicit form `columns`  ??  widest section's `columns`  ??  1

  The two keys answer different questions and the precedence reflects that: the
  view's `columns` is how wide the grid is, a section's `columns` is how densely
  that section fills it (via per-field `colSpan`). `columns` is declared on
  `TabbedFormSchema` / `SplitFormSchema` accordingly — `ObjectForm` already spread
  it through, it was simply being dropped on arrival.

- c735bf7: fix(form): a spec-vocabulary field no longer crashes the standalone form, and every surface now says which vocabulary you meant — #3090

  Writing the regression test against the unfixed renderer proved the failure
  was worse than the assumed silent drop: a `{ field: 'x' }` entry (spec
  form-VIEW vocabulary) slipped past the `f?.name` guards into a
  react-hook-form Controller with `name === undefined` and crashed the whole
  standalone form on `name.split('.')`, with nothing naming the culprit entry.
  The renderer now partitions such entries out — the rest of the form renders —
  and surfaces them with an inline alert plus a console.error whose text is the
  fix instruction (rename to `name`, or use an object-bound form whose sections
  accept the spec shape).

  `objectui validate` grows the same boundary awareness: on failure, a
  `{ field: … }` entry in a standalone form gets a "likely cause" hint naming
  the real fix instead of the bare `invalid_union` — the previous message read
  as "bolt a `name` on", which converts spec metadata wrongly. On success,
  mixed-vocabulary entries (`name` + string `field`) get a warning: they
  validate, but the spec key is dead weight the renderer ignores.

  `normalizeSectionField` warns (once per site) when an authored section field
  mixes both identity keys — the spec branch derives the runtime name from
  `field`, so an authored `name` was silently overwritten.

- e339d60: fix(plugin-form): swapping `recordId` no longer leaves the previous record on screen

  `loading` in `ModalForm` / `DrawerForm` / `TabbedForm` / `SplitForm` was only ever
  set `true` once, by `useState(true)`, and thereafter only ever set `false`. A
  `recordId` change therefore re-entered the fetch effect **without** going back
  through the loading branch: the form stayed mounted showing — and accepting edits
  to — record A's values, with nothing indicating a different record had been asked
  for, until B's response landed and replaced them in place. Anything typed in that
  window read as A's on screen and would have been submitted against B.

  The same effect had no staleness guard either, so two overlapping reads landed in
  **completion** order rather than request order: ask for B then C, and a slow B
  arriving last left the form showing B while the caller had asked for C.

  Both are the same defect from the user's side — the form displays a record nobody
  asked for — so both are fixed:

  - a change of record re-enters the loading state before the read, so the previous
    record is off screen while the next one is in flight. Gated on the record
    actually changing: the effect also re-runs on `initialData`/`initialValues`
    identity churn (callers rebuild those objects every render), and flashing the
    loading state for that would thrash;
  - the effect's cleanup marks its read stale, so a response that is no longer the
    one being awaited is dropped instead of overwriting a newer record.

  `ObjectForm` already re-entered loading before its fetch, which is why this only
  ever reproduced on the four sectioned variants.

  **Also fixed, a consequence of the above:** hiding the form unmounts the inner
  renderer, and that renderer is the only thing that reports dirtiness via
  `onDirtyChange` — it gets no chance to report `false` on the way out. Without
  clearing the flag, the overlay's unsaved-input guards would stay armed for input
  belonging to a record no longer on screen: a plain refresh would prompt, and
  closing would offer to discard nothing.

- aa35561: fix(form): a split create/edit form no longer loses the panel you are not submitting from (#2153)

  `SplitForm` rendered one `SchemaRenderer` — one react-hook-form instance and one
  `<form>` element — **per section**, and its two groups of sections live in
  separate resizable panels. So each panel owned isolated form state: submitting
  from one panel's action bar sent only that section's fields and silently dropped
  everything the user had typed on the other side of the divider. Filling both
  panels and clicking Create persisted `{ subject }` alone.

  The same isolation killed cross-panel field rules: a `visibleWhen` in the right
  panel referencing a left-panel field never saw that field in its record, so the
  predicate faulted and failed **open** — the field the author meant to hide was
  always shown.

  Both panels are now ONE form. The panel group became a layout the form renderer
  owns, via a new `FormSchema.fieldPanes` (+ `fieldPanesOrientation`,
  `fieldPanesResizable`) that mirrors `fieldTabs` (#2959): the `<form>` wraps the
  whole `ResizablePanelGroup` and each pane holds only fields, which is what lets a
  single react-hook-form instance span the divider. Sections inside a pane render
  behind the inline `section-divider` header, each at its own declared column
  density within the form's shared grid.

  One more fix falls out of moving the panels into the renderer: `splitResizable:
false` now actually pins the divider. It previously only hid the grip — the
  separator stayed draggable, because nothing passed the panel library's
  `disabled`.

  Each pane is its own `@container`, so a multi-column section collapses to fewer
  columns as its panel is dragged narrower instead of overflowing.

- 3c1f321: fix(form): a tabbed/sectioned create-edit form no longer loses the tabs you are not looking at (#2959, #2153)

  The explicit-`sections` path rendered one `SchemaRenderer` — one react-hook-form
  instance and one `<form>` element — **per section**, all sharing the same
  `formId`. Two failures compounded:

  1. the footer submit button (`form={formId}`) can only be associated with the
     **first** of those forms, so section 2+ never reached the payload; and
  2. in the `tabbed` variant Radix unmounted the inactive panel, destroying that
     tab's form state outright.

  Reported flow (HotCRM, 3 tabs, required `description` on tab 3): fill tab 1 →
  submit → server 400 `description is required` → switch to tab 3, fill it →
  submit → the server now reports `subject; description; status; priority` **all**
  missing, because the second submit's body had lost every earlier value.

  `ModalForm` (stacked and `contentLayout: 'tabbed'`) and `TabbedForm` now render
  ONE form for all sections, matching `ObjectForm` / `DrawerForm`. Stacked sections
  use the existing inline `section-divider` header (which now also renders the
  section's `description`); tabbed sections go through a new
  `FormSchema.fieldTabs` (+ `defaultFieldTab`, `fieldTabsPosition`) that the form
  renderer distributes into **force-mounted** Radix panels — CSS-hidden rather
  than unmounted, since react-hook-form skips validation for unmounted fields,
  which is how a required field on a tab nobody opened used to sail past the
  client and come back as a server 400.

  Validation feedback now points at the tab: a rejected field activates its tab and
  every tab holding one is marked on its trigger, for client-side rules and server
  `fields[]` rejections alike.

- c0d0bc8: fix(form): a wizard with `allowSkip` no longer submits past the required fields you skipped

  `allowSkip` let the user jump to any step from the indicator, and
  `handleStepClick` did so without validating anything on the way. Since a wizard
  mounts ONE step at a time and react-hook-form only validates the fields currently
  **mounted**, a required field on a step nobody opened was never registered, never
  validated, and simply absent from the payload.

  Measured against the unfixed component — 3 steps, required `owner` on step 2,
  `allowSkip: true`, click step 3's indicator, fill it, hit Create:

      createCalls: 1
      payload:     { subject: 'S1', notes: 'S3' }   // `owner` missing entirely
      UI mentions "required": false                 // nothing said so

  So an invalid create went out and the client said nothing about why — #2959's
  validation half, wearing a wizard's clothes.

  The final submit now checks the WHOLE declared field set, and when something is
  outstanding it returns the user to the first step that has one, marks that step's
  indicator (`data-error="true"`, destructive circle + icon), names the fields in a
  toast, and sends nothing. Conditional rules are honoured: the check runs on the
  canonical `resolveFieldRuleState`, the same engine the form renderer and the
  server's rule-validator use, so a field hidden by `visibleWhen` or not yet
  required by `requiredWhen` is not demanded. The sequential path is unaffected —
  a forward jump is refused without `allowSkip`, so Next already validated each step.

  Also in `WizardForm`:

  - `FormView.columns` is now honoured (spec key, previously dropped): the grid
    width is the view's `columns`, else the step's own. Unlike the tabbed/split
    hosts there is no widest-section fallback — wizard steps never share a viewport,
    so each keeps its authored width.
  - the root gained `@container`. The step grid is sized with container queries, and
    without a container ancestor every `@md:`/`@2xl:` variant was inert — a step
    declaring 2 columns rendered single-column. Found by running it in a browser;
    the class was present all along, which is why asserting the class alone had
    missed it.

### Minor Changes

- f9bbddb: feat: gate detail/form edit & delete on the server's effective operation set (#3546)

  PR-4 (#3391) wired the **list/toolbar** surface (ObjectView Import, ListView /
  ObjectGrid Export) to the server-resolved effective API operation set
  (`/me/permissions` `apiOperations`, intersected via
  `resolveCrudAffordances(obj, effectiveApiOperations?)`). The **detail / form**
  surfaces still gated edit/delete on the bucket + `userActions` alone. This
  extends the same intersection to them, so the record page and its forms never
  offer an operation the server would 405.

  - **core** `isObjectInlineEditable(obj, effectiveApiOperations?)` gains the same
    optional second argument as `resolveCrudAffordances` — inline-edit is now
    additionally ANDed with the server allowing `update`.
  - **app-shell** `RecordDetailView` threads the object's effective operations into
    the synthesized Edit/Delete header actions and the record-body inline-edit
    gate (`canEdit`); `RelatedRecordActionsBridge` intersects each **child**
    object's Create/Edit/Delete handlers with that child's own effective set.
  - **plugin-detail** `record:details` ANDs its inline-edit affordance with the
    object's effective `update`.
  - **plugin-form** `ObjectForm`'s blanket managed-object field lock also engages
    when the server denies `update` (edit mode) / `create` (create mode).

  Backward-compatible: a missing effective set (unrestricted object, older
  backend, or no `PermissionProvider`) leaves the resolved affordance untouched —
  the bucket/`userActions` decision wins, exactly as today. Layers on top of the
  existing per-object `check('edit')` / `check('delete')` permission gates
  (intersection, never union).

### Patch Changes

- 6dee2cb: feat(form): consume spec-aligned FormView buttons/defaults in ObjectForm

  The authored `@objectstack/spec` FormViewSchema carries structured
  `buttons.{submit,cancel,reset}.{show,label}` and `defaults`, but the form
  renderer only read the flat renderer-invented `showSubmit`/`submitText`/
  `showCancel`/`cancelText`/`showReset`/`initialValues`. That left the two spec
  keys parsed-but-inert (ADR-0078) and stuck at `experimental` in the spec
  liveness ledger.

  `ObjectForm` now folds the structured shape down onto those flat props inside
  its existing normalization pass, so every entry path (ObjectView
  drawer/modal/page, RecordFormPage) honors it. An explicitly-set flat key still
  wins, so metadata authored against the deprecated flat keys is unchanged.
  `ObjectView` and `RecordFormPage` forward `buttons`/`defaults` from the spec
  form view. `ObjectFormSchema` gains the optional `buttons`/`defaults` fields.

  Refs objectstack-ai/objectstack#1894, objectstack-ai/objectstack#2998.

- 2f947e4: fix(page,field): consume the spec's `type`/`label`/`maxLength` keys (framework#1878 §3 naming-drift recheck)

  Three forward-drifts where objectui read a different key than the spec
  declares, so authoring the documented key silently no-oped:

  - **page `type` → `pageType`** (app-shell + components): `PageSchema` declares
    the page KIND as `type`, but `PageRenderer` reads `schema.pageType` and fell
    back to `'record'` — and nothing mapped between them. Every non-record page
    (`home`/`app`/`list`/`utility`) rendered with the record max-width, a wrong
    `data-page-type` attribute, and a suppressed header. `PageView` now passes
    `pageType` alongside the SchemaNode discriminator `type`.
  - **page `label` → `title`** (components): `PageSchema.label` is required but the
    region renderer read only `title`. Now dual-reads `title ?? label`, mirroring
    the fallback `DashboardRenderer` already uses. Coupled with the above — the
    header is gated on `pageType !== 'record'`, so both were needed for a title to
    appear.
  - **field `maxLength`/`minLength`** (plugin-form + fields): validation already
    dual-read these, but `ObjectForm`'s HTML-attribute pass and `TextAreaField`
    read `max_length` only, so a spec-authored `maxLength` gave no browser cap and
    no character counter. Both now dual-read, matching `buildValidationRules`.

  Verified in the browser against the showcase: `capability_map` (`type: 'home'`)
  now renders `data-page-type="home"`, the `home` max-width and its page title;
  record pages are unchanged.

- 662bdf9: fix(fls): wire the real per-caller FLS channel into import targets and grid
  columns; remove the never-populated `field.permissions` shape (objectstack#3661)

  The `permissions?: { read?, write?, edit? }` key on `@object-ui/types` field
  definitions (Phase 3.2.6) was declared-but-never-enforced: no producer in the
  stack ever populated it, so every guard reading it short-circuited to "allow".
  Per ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove, the shape is deleted and the three consumers
  now use the server-resolved `/auth/me/permissions` channel
  (`usePermissions().checkField`) — the same channel ObjectForm/ModalForm/ListView
  already enforce:

  - **ImportWizard target fields (app-shell `ObjectView`)**: the importable
    field set (and thus the downloadable CSV template's columns) now drops
    fields the caller cannot edit, instead of offering columns the server's
    FLS write gate would 403.
  - **ObjectGrid auto-derived columns**: columns the caller cannot read are
    dropped (same gate ListView applies), instead of a dead schema-shape check.
  - **ObjectForm**: the redundant dead guard in field generation is removed;
    the existing `applyFieldPerms` gate remains the real enforcement point.

  BREAKING CHANGE: `@object-ui/types` field definitions no longer accept a
  `permissions` key. It never carried data at runtime; consumers needing
  per-caller field-level permissions must use `@object-ui/permissions`
  (`MePermissionsProvider` + `useFieldPermissions`/`checkField`).

- dc7a798: fix(plugin-grid,plugin-form,plugin-designer,cli,vscode-extension): type-check the last five unchecked packages, and fix the two runtime bugs that hid there (#2919)

  Closes the remaining `DEBT` entries from the #2911 sweep. Each package gains
  `"type-check": "tsc --noEmit"` and loses its entry in
  `scripts/check-type-check-coverage.mjs`; coverage goes 36 -> 41 of 45 and
  outstanding errors 25 -> 5 (only #2916 `plugin-view` and #2918 `layout` remain).

  **Two of these were real bugs, not just type noise.**

  `@object-ui/cli` — `objectui validate` could never report a validation failure.
  `ZodError.errors` was removed in Zod 4 (the repo is on 4.4.3), so `.errors` read
  `undefined` and `.forEach` threw a `TypeError` that the enclosing `catch`
  reported as `✗ Error reading or parsing schema file: Cannot read properties of
undefined` — swallowing the very errors the command exists to print. Now reads
  `.issues`. Verified against the built CLI: an invalid schema now prints
  `1. Invalid input / Code: invalid_union` and exits 1.

  `@object-ui/plugin-grid` — grouping a grid by a boolean column showed the raw
  i18n key. `t('grid.booleanTrue', 'Yes')` asked for a key present in neither
  `GRID_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS` nor any locale bundle, and passed the English
  fallback as a bare second argument — which `createSafeTranslation`'s no-provider
  translator reads as an _options object_, so the fallback never applied and the
  header rendered the literal `grid.booleanTrue`. Switched to the `grid.yes` /
  `grid.no` keys the boolean cell renderer (`ObjectGrid.tsx`) and
  `BulkActionDialog` already use, with the fallback passed as `defaultValue`.
  Covered by a new regression test, confirmed to fail against the old code.

  The rest are type-only corrections that preserve runtime behaviour exactly:

  - **plugin-grid** `importParsers.ts` — `scorePair`'s `score`/`reason` moved into
    one `best` record. They were captured `let`s mutated only inside the `bump`
    closure, which TypeScript's control-flow analysis does not track, so it still
    believed `reason` was `'none'` at the type gate and flagged the comparisons as
    non-overlapping (TS2367). The gate — which stops a text column being mapped
    onto a number field — is unchanged; its two dedicated tests still pass.
  - **plugin-form** — `SectionFieldsContext.fieldLabel` now requires `fallback`,
    matching the `useSafeFieldLabel` producer in `@object-ui/i18n` (an omitted
    fallback could not satisfy the `=> string` return, and all four call sites
    already pass one). This one signature cleared six errors.
    `MasterDetailFormSchema.recordId` widens to `string | number`, matching
    `ObjectFormSchema` and the five envelopes that forward straight into it;
    it is narrowed with `String()` only at the batch-transaction boundary, whose
    `BatchTransactionOperation.id` is a string by protocol (the `isEdit` guard
    already proves it non-null there). `deriveMasterDetail`'s column sort gets an
    explicit `fillPriority` helper — `GridColumn.type` is optional, and a column
    without one keeps sorting at priority 5 exactly as the old
    `TYPE_FILL_PRIORITY[undefined] ?? 5` lookup put it.
  - **plugin-designer** — unused `index` parameter prefixed `_`, matching the
    `_entry` beside it.
  - **cli** — a stale `@ts-expect-error` removed; `viteConfig` is typed `any`, so
    the line it guarded had stopped erroring.
  - **vscode-extension** (`object-ui`) — migrated off `moduleResolution: "node"`,
    which is deprecated and stops working in TypeScript 7, to `node16` paired with
    `module: "node16"` (the package has no `"type": "module"`, so node16 resolves
    it as the CommonJS that tsup emits, and it gains the `exports`-map awareness
    node10 lacks). Its error count was under-reported as 1: that TS5107 config
    error masked four more. The package uses `console`/`Buffer` but sets
    `lib: ["ES2020"]` with no DOM and never declared `@types/node` — added, with an
    explicit `types: ["node", "vscode"]`.

  Also: `plugin-grid`, `plugin-form` and `plugin-designer` gain the `baseUrl` +
  `paths` override their type-checked plugin peers already carry, and `cli` an
  empty `paths`. Without it the inherited root `paths` point `@object-ui/*` at
  sibling `src/`, which is outside each project's `rootDir` and produces the ~104
  spurious TS6059 errors noted in #2915; workspace deps instead resolve through
  node_modules to built `.d.ts`, which `type-check`'s `dependsOn: ["^build"]`
  guarantees exist.

  Verified the gate genuinely covers all five rather than trusting the green:
  injecting a type error into each package makes `pnpm type-check --filter <pkg>`
  fail, which was impossible before this change.

### Minor Changes

- 62b9ab5: feat(data): unify master-detail saves behind `DataSource.batchTransaction`, isolate the non-atomic fallback in the adapter (#2679)

  Master-detail saves (`MasterDetailForm`, `LineItemsPanel`) now always persist
  through `dataSource.batchTransaction(operations)` — one ordered cross-object
  operation list, with `{ $ref: <op index> }` linking a child to a parent created
  in the same batch. The form no longer contains any client-side orchestration or
  best-effort compensation-delete; that atomicity anti-pattern is gone from the UI
  layer (framework #1604 / framework ADR-0034 item 4).

  - **`@object-ui/types`** — `batchTransaction?` is now a first-class (optional)
    method on the `DataSource` contract, typed via `BatchTransactionOperation` /
    `BatchRef`. Replaces the previous `(dataSource as any).batchTransaction`
    method-sniffing.
  - **`@object-ui/core`** — new `emulateBatchTransaction(dataSource, operations)`
    (sequential writes, `$ref` resolution, best-effort reverse-order compensation)
    and `runBatchTransaction(dataSource, operations)` (prefers the adapter's method,
    emulates otherwise). `ApiDataSource` / `ValueDataSource` implement
    `batchTransaction` via the emulation.
  - **`@object-ui/data-objectstack`** — `ObjectStackAdapter.batchTransaction` uses
    the server's atomic `POST /api/v1/batch`, prefers the typed
    `client.data.batchTransaction` SDK method when the installed client exposes it,
    and degrades to the client-side emulation ONLY when the endpoint is missing
    (404/405) or the runtime can't do transactions (501). Real errors (400/401/403/
    409/500) still surface. This is the isolated, tested home of the non-atomic
    fallback.
  - **`@object-ui/plugin-form`** — removed `applyDetail` / `createMany` /
    `ApplyDetailResult` from `masterDetailTx.ts`; `MasterDetailForm` and
    `LineItemsPanel` build ops and call `runBatchTransaction`. `LineItemsPanel`
    saves are now atomic on a capable backend, with the rollup folded into the same
    batch.

  No behavior change on a current ObjectStack backend (it has `/api/v1/batch`);
  older/limited backends keep a working — now clearly non-atomic — save path.

### Patch Changes

- 7cf4051: chore(deps): align every `@objectstack/*` dependency to `^16.0.0-rc.0`

  Bumps `@objectstack/spec` / `client` / `formula` / `lint` from `^15.1.1` to the
  `16.0.0-rc.0` pre-release across the workspace (root + `apps/console` +
  `apps/site` + all consuming packages). ObjectUI's own packages are already on
  major 16, so this closes the 15↔16 skew between ObjectUI and the `@objectstack`
  contract libraries (which publish in lockstep with `spec`).

  This is a dependency alignment, not a behavioral migration: the full workspace
  build (43/43) and the `@objectstack`-consuming package test suites
  (`core` / `app-shell` / `data-objectstack` / `plugin-form` / `types`) are green
  against `16.0.0-rc.0` with no source changes required.

  Practical effect: `@objectstack/client@16.0.0-rc.0` now ships
  `data.batchTransaction` (framework #3271), so `ObjectStackAdapter`'s feature
  detect (`typeof client.data.batchTransaction === 'function'`) routes
  master-detail cross-object saves through the typed SDK method instead of the
  raw `fetch('/api/v1/batch')` fallback — realizing the "verify SDK path" half of
  #2694. The raw-fetch branch stays as a defensive fallback (removal tracked in
  #2694).

- 0a3710b: **Finish the `managedBy` / `userActions` de-dup — one parser for the override shape (completes objectui#2712, framework#3343).** #2712 consolidated the bucket _union_ + affordance _set_ mirrors but left four surfaces still parsing the `userActions.{create,edit,delete}` override shape by hand. They now all route through the shared `@object-ui/core` policy, so no package re-implements the boolean / #2614-object-form parse locally.

  - **`@object-ui/core`** promotes the internal `normalizeOverride` to the exported **`normalizeUserAction(v, base)`** (the one parser) and adds **`userActionPredicates(v)`** for per-record CEL predicate extraction.
  - **`app-shell/utils/managedByEmptyState.ts`** — the writable-`system` create check and its local `EmptyStateUserActions` interface are replaced by `resolveCrudAffordances({ managedBy, userActions }).create`.
  - **`plugin-grid/rowCrudAffordances.ts`** — the local `isOptedOut` / `predicatesOf` helpers (and duplicated `RowCrudUserAction` / `RowCrudPredicates` types) fold into `normalizeUserAction`; the historical type names stay re-exported for compat.
  - **`plugin-detail/RelatedList.tsx`** — its inline `predicatesOf` fold into `userActionPredicates`.
  - **`plugin-form/ObjectForm.tsx`** — the hand-rolled `managedBy !== 'platform'` blanket lock + `userActions` unlock is replaced by the resolved affordance for the current mode (`edit` / `create`), the **same** `resolveCrudAffordances` contract the detail (`isObjectInlineEditable`) and grid surfaces use.

  Behavior-preserving for `platform` / `system` / `append-only` / `better-auth`, with one deliberate alignment: an admin-editable **`config`**-bucket object (e.g. `sys_webhook`, `sys_permission_set`) is now editable in `ObjectForm` — it was previously over-locked as "non-`platform`", while detail/grid already treated it as editable (`config` resolves `edit: true`). New unit coverage for the shared parser and the config / create-mode form gate; all existing affordance/edit-gate tests stay green.

### Minor Changes

- 9d4a429: fix(form+detail): keep single-file children as inline grids; drop non-spec `attachment` handling

  Two follow-ups to the upload-in-grid work (objectui#2360):

  - **#2654** — Now that `file`/`image`/`avatar` fields render a compact upload
    cell in the line-item grid, a child object with a _single_ such field no
    longer flips the smart `inlineEdit` default to a per-row form. `resolveInlineMode`
    splits the old `FORM_ONLY_TYPES`: truly form-only types (textarea / richtext /
    html / markdown / json / location / address) still tip to `form` on their own,
    while file-family types only tip when several rich fields pile up
    (`RICH_FIELD_FORM_THRESHOLD`, default 2). An explicit `inlineEdit` always wins.

  - **#2655** — `attachment` is not a `@objectstack/spec` field type (the spec
    media types are file/image/avatar/video/audio), so the renderer no longer
    models it: removed from `fieldTypeToColumnType`, the inline-mode heuristic, and
    `RelatedList`'s auto-column `SKIP_TYPES`. Contract-first cleanup — the renderer
    stops fossilizing a phantom type (AGENTS.md #0.1).

### Patch Changes

- 5534535: feat(grid): built-in row Edit/Delete honor per-record CEL predicates (#2614)

  The object's `userActions.edit` / `userActions.delete` now also accept an
  object form `{ enabled?, visibleWhen?, disabledWhen? }`. The predicates are
  evaluated per row on the canonical CEL engine (`useRowPredicate`, the same
  machinery custom row actions use): `visibleWhen` false → the built-in
  Edit/Delete item is not rendered for that row (fail-closed); `disabledWhen`
  true → rendered disabled (fail-soft). Wired through ObjectGrid's
  RowActionMenu and the data-table's row overflow menu (the related-list
  path), with the app-shell `crudAffordances` mirror kept in lockstep.
  Omitting the predicates (or using plain booleans) keeps today's behavior
  bit-for-bit; declared predicates evaluate only when a row's menu opens, so
  grid rendering cost is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 579b24d: feat(fields+form+detail): file/image uploads in inline line-item grids (#2360)

  `Field.file` in a master-detail inline grid previously degraded to a plain text
  input (no `input[type=file]` on the page → no way to upload from the grid), and
  auto-derived subform / related-list columns silently dropped file fields.

  - **fields**: new `FileCell` — a compact upload control for grid cells (upload
    button + removable chips, image thumbnails), sharing the `UploadProvider`
    pipeline with the full-size `FileField` via an extracted `useFileUploads`
    hook. `GridField` supports `type: 'file'` columns (with `accept` /
    `multiple`), renders file names in list/readonly modes, and no longer falls
    back to a text `<Input>` for file columns.
  - **plugin-form**: `deriveColumns` / `hydrateColumns` no longer exclude
    `file`/`image`/`avatar` fields — they map to `file` columns and carry the
    field's `multiple` + `accept` (image fields default to `['image/*']`).
  - **plugin-detail**: auto-derived related-list columns no longer skip
    `file`/`image` fields — they render through the existing FileCellRenderer /
    ImageCellRenderer (file-name chip / thumbnail).

### Patch Changes

- e492b9d: Permission sets — pure separation of **design** (Studio) and **assignment**
  (Setup), per ADR-0056 / epic #2398. A `sys_permission_set` used to render its six
  authorization facets in Setup as raw `[Object]` / JSON textareas, and only
  objects+fields were editable in Studio; this reworks both surfaces.

  **Setup (assign + read-only):**

  - The six facets (`object_permissions`, `field_permissions`, `system_permissions`,
    `row_level_security`, `tab_permissions`, `admin_scope`) now render read-only on
    the `sys_permission_set` record page as a compact summary (counts, or capability
    chips) plus a **“Design in Studio →”** deep-link into the structured editor
    (`/apps/:appName/metadata/permission/:setName`, env scope). No `[Object]`, no
    JSON — in the record view, inline edit, and the create/edit form. Implemented as
    a `permission-facet-link` field widget stamped onto the six fields via the single
    `ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema` choke point and honored by DetailSection +
    the record form.
  - User assignment (add/remove via `sys_user_permission_set`) is surfaced directly
    on the Setup record page.

  **Studio (design every facet):** the permission matrix editor gains structured
  editors for the facets that were JSON-only —

  - **System Capabilities**: a multi-select over the live `sys_capability` registry
    (scope-grouped, labelled chips).
  - **Row-Level Security**: per-policy rows (object · operation · enabled) with CEL
    USING/CHECK.
  - **Tab Visibility**: per-tab `visible | hidden | default_on | default_off`.
  - **Delegated Admin Scope**: business-unit + subtree, manage-assignments /
    -bindings / author-env-sets toggles, and an assignable-permission-sets allowlist.
    Assignment was moved out of the editor (it is now a Setup act) — the editor is
    purely a design surface.

  Storage/types are unchanged; editors read/write the draft’s existing parsed
  fields and tolerate legacy JSON strings on load. Note: env-scope metadata saves of
  these facets do not yet project onto the queryable `sys_permission_set` data
  record the Setup summary reads, so a fresh Studio edit isn’t reflected in Setup’s
  read-only view until the projection refreshes — tracked as a framework follow-up
  (enforcement reads the authoritative metadata).

- 5da9905: fix(plugin-form): honor `userActions.edit` on managed objects instead of blanket-disabling every field (ADR-0092 D4)

  `ObjectForm` disabled every field on any non-`platform` lifecycle bucket
  (config / system / append-only / better-auth) — a defensive default from when
  those objects had no generic edit affordance at all. Now that an object can
  OPEN per-record editing via `userActions.{edit,create}` (framework ADR-0092 D4
  — e.g. `sys_user` exposing its `name`/`image` profile fields), the blanket
  lock lifts for the current mode when its affordance is `true`, and each
  field's own `readonly` flag decides. Managed buckets still default the
  affordance off, so an object that doesn't opt in is unchanged. The server-side
  identity write guard remains the real boundary; this is UX only.

### Patch Changes

- 195121a: Studio form designer + preview now match the runtime form's column density.

  The Data pillar's **Form → Layout** designer laid every section out in a fixed 2-column grid capped at `max-w-3xl`, and **Form → Preview** capped the real `ObjectForm` at `max-w-2xl`. So on a wide screen the studio showed at most 2 columns while the record the end user actually edits spreads to up to 4 — the design surface misrepresented the real layout.

  `ObjectFormDesigner` now derives its column count the same way the runtime form does (`inferColumns` over the object's editable field count, objectui#2578) and lays each section out with the shared container-query grid classes (`containerGridColsFor`) inside a per-section `@container`, so a field-heavy object reaches 4 fields per row on wide screens and collapses to one column when the panel is narrow. Wide widgets (textarea/markdown/html/…) span the full row, mirroring the form. Both the layout and preview canvases were widened to `max-w-6xl` so the container queries can actually reach 4 columns. `containerGridColsFor` is now exported from `@object-ui/plugin-form` as the single source of truth for these grid classes.

## 12.0.0

### Minor Changes

- e4de456: Fix form section grouping inconsistencies found in a UX review of grouped forms:

  - **Unified section visual language.** `FormSection`'s Card-wrapped path (used by Modal/Split/Tabbed/Wizard forms) previously rendered as a nearly-invisible white-on-white card (same `bg-card` as the page background, distinguished only by a barely-visible shadow) with a duplicated, inconsistent header (different title size, and a collapse chevron positioned differently) versus the flat `SectionDivider` path used by simple/drawer forms. Both now share the same header treatment (`text-sm font-semibold`, inline-left chevron, bottom border), and the Card path gets a soft `bg-muted/40` tint so grouped sections are visually distinguishable without relying on shadow alone.
  - **`readonly` no longer renders as `disabled`.** A field marked `readonly` (statically or via `readonlyWhen`) was being folded into the `disabled` prop before reaching field widgets, so widgets with a dedicated readonly display (e.g. `EmailField`'s mailto link, `TextField`'s plain-text view) never received it — every readonly field just looked permanently disabled. `readonly` is now forwarded as its own prop; generic `input`/`textarea` fields get a distinct readonly style (`bg-muted/40`, no `cursor-not-allowed`) instead of the disabled look.
  - **Section `className`/`gridClassName` now flow through JSON schemas.** `ObjectFormSection` and the per-form-variant section configs (`ModalFormSectionConfig`, `SplitFormSectionConfig`, `FormSectionConfig`, `DrawerFormSectionConfig`) accept `className` (and `gridClassName` where applicable), wired through `ObjectForm`'s form-type dispatch into `FormSection`/`SectionDivider` — closing a gap where section wrappers couldn't be customized from schema despite `FormSection` itself already supporting it.

### Patch Changes

- fae75e2: Fix two bugs verified still-present after #2254 claimed to resolve them (framework#2620 / framework#2616 Showcase UX pass, tracked in #2268):

  - **Wizard/form `submitBehavior: 'thank-you'` allowed duplicate resubmission.** #2254 fixed the spec-bridge dropping `submitBehavior` before it reached the renderer, so the configured toast message started appearing — but `WizardForm`'s last step and `ObjectForm`'s submit handler only ever called `toast.success(...)` for `thank-you`/`next-record`; the form stayed mounted and fully filled with its submit button re-enabled once the request settled, so a second click created a second record. Both components now track a terminal `submitted` state and, when set, replace the form with a confirmation panel (using the behavior's `title`/`message`, which were also never read before) — mirroring the pattern `apps/console/src/components/FormPage.tsx` already used for its own standalone forms.

  - **Command Center-style 3-up chart bands stayed collapsed to ~100-130px, and a dataset-bound chart's measure leaked its raw field name.**
    - `responsiveStyles` (and `style`) were declared on the page-spec `PageComponent` bridge input type but never copied onto the `SchemaNode` in `spec-bridge/bridges/page.ts::mapComponent()` — so a page author's ADR-0065 layout override (e.g. forcing `display: 'grid'` on a `type: 'flex'` band) never reached `SchemaRenderer`, and the node silently fell back to its default flex layout. Both fields are now mapped through.
    - `ObjectChart`'s dataset-bound fetch path (`schema.dataset` + `ds.queryDataset(...)`) discarded the response's `fields` array (which carries each measure's `label`, e.g. `{ name: 'task_count', label: 'Tasks' }`) before it ever reached `buildChartSeries()` — whose `fields` param already resolves this correctly (see `chart-series.test.ts`) — so the legend/tooltip always fell back to the raw field name. The fetched `fields` are now captured and threaded through.

- ec9c8ee: Fix master-detail record create: stop double success toast + localize the Cancel button.

  Objects with inline subforms (master-detail, e.g. a Lead with product line items)
  render `MasterDetailForm` inside `ModalForm`/`DrawerForm` instead of the plain
  footer, which exposed two mismatches with the host contract:

  - **Double success toast.** Flat `ObjectForm` delegates confirmation to the host
    when an `onSuccess` is supplied (skips its own default toast), but
    `MasterDetailForm.handleSaved` ALWAYS toasted `Created`/`Saved` AND ran
    `onSuccess`. In the console the host's `onSuccess` chains into the `crud_success`
    handler, which toasts a localized message — so create fired both `Created` and
    e.g. `线索创建成功`. `handleSaved` now only toasts as a fallback when no host
    `onSuccess` is provided, matching the `ObjectForm` contract; saves without a host
    handler stay non-silent.

  - **Hardcoded English `Cancel`.** The master-detail action bar wrote `Cancel` as a
    literal and accepted no `cancelText`, so the button stayed English while the
    submit button was localized (`submitText` was already forwarded).
    `MasterDetailForm` now takes `cancelText`, and `ModalForm`/`DrawerForm`/`ObjectForm`
    forward the host's localized label down the subforms branch.

  Adds regression tests: create with a host `onSuccess` fires no built-in toast (no
  double-confirm), and the Cancel button renders the host-supplied `cancelText`.

- 6c1ad9e: Record task flows open as derived overlays with lossless return (framework#2604, extends framework#2578).

  - **Create/Edit never route** — the global record form is URL-driven (`?form=new` / `?form=<id>`): browser Back closes the overlay with the origin (list scroll/filters, detail state) intact; field-heavy objects derive a full-screen modal (`modalSize:'full'`) via the new `deriveRecordFlowSurface` mirror in plugin-view, light ones keep the auto-sized modal. `editMode:'page'` opt-in unchanged.
  - **Save invariant** — _edit never moves you_ (origin refetches in place); _create lands on the new record's detail_ on its derived surface (drawer over the still-intact list for light objects, detail route for heavy), with `replace:true` so Back skips the transient form entry.
  - **Subtable child create/edit = overlay over the parent detail, never a route** — related-list New/Edit push `?form=…&formObject=<child>&formLink=<fk>:<parentId>`; the one global overlay pre-links the parent (refresh-safe), sizes to the CHILD object, and on save stays on the parent while only the child's related lists refetch. ModalForm now forwards `initialValues` into its master-detail (subforms) branch so pre-links survive for children with inline line items.

### Minor Changes

- 8bf6295: feat: adaptive record surface + semantic field span + responsive columns (framework#2578)

  Field-heavy objects (all metadata is AI-authored) now present themselves without
  any authored presentation config:

  - **Adaptive surface** — a record's create/edit/detail opens as a full page when
    the object is field-heavy, or a drawer when it is light. Derived from field
    count (`deriveRecordSurface`), not authored; mobile always pages. Wired into the
    app-shell ObjectView detail navigation (an authored view/object `navigation`
    still wins).
  - **Semantic field span** — `FormField.span` (`auto`/`full`) is a width primitive
    decoupled from the (per-surface derived) column count; legacy `colSpan` is
    clamped so it never overflows. `ObjectForm` now honours per-section `columns`
    and carries `span`/`colSpan` from section defs — fixes the bug where
    `type:'simple'` ignored `section.columns` and grouped fields rendered single
    column.
  - **Responsive columns** — `inferColumns` scales the column CAP with field count
    (≤3→1, ≤8→2, ≤15→3, 16+→4); the ACTUAL column count follows the form's real
    width via CSS container queries, so the same form goes 1→2→3→4 columns as a
    drawer widens or becomes a page.
  - **Runtime overlay width** — `NavigationConfig.size` bucket is resolved to a
    viewport-clamped width at runtime (`overlayWidthFor`); a pixel width is never
    authored (the author cannot know the client viewport).

- 144ab55: Consume the ADR-0085 object semantic roles from `@objectstack/spec@11.7.0`, retiring the per-surface hint dialects:

  - **Single-source fieldGroups derivation**: `plugin-form`'s `deriveFieldGroupSections` and `plugin-detail`'s `deriveFieldGroupDetailSections` are now thin adapters over the spec's `deriveFieldGroupLayout` (ADR-0085 §5) — forms, modals and detail pages render the SAME grouping from one implementation. The canonical `collapse: 'none' | 'expanded' | 'collapsed'` enum is honoured everywhere (deprecated `collapsible`/`collapsed` and `defaultExpanded` spellings still read for pre-11.7 metadata).
  - **`stageField` semantic role**: the detail stepper reads the top-level `stageField`; `stageField: false` now actually suppresses stage detection (previously the `false` handling was wired to the removed `detail.stageField` key, so spec-authored `false` fell through to the name heuristic).
  - **`highlightFields` rename**: default grid columns, card compact views, the detail highlight strip, child-record preview fields and interface-page default columns read the object's `highlightFields` (deprecated `compactLayout` spelling read as fallback for pre-11.7 metadata).
  - **Removed dead reads**: the never-spec-writable `objectDef.views.*` UI hints and the ADR-0085-removed `detail.*` block (`sections`, `sectionGroups`, `highlightFields`, `stageField`, `useFieldGroups`, `showReferenceRail`, `hideReferenceRail`, `hideRelatedTab`, `relatedLayout`) are no longer consulted. Per-page customization goes through an assigned Page schema (`record:reference_rail` remains available there as a renderer capability). `detail.renderViaSchema` survives only as the legacy-renderer kill-switch and is removed together with that path.

### Patch Changes

- c38d107: Fix view-level `FormField.visibleOn` (CEL) never taking effect (#2212).

  The spec ships `visibleOn` as an Expression object `{ dialect: 'cel', source }`
  (what the `P` template emits) or a bare string, but the whole chain dropped it:

  - `sectionFields.ts` / `ObjectForm.tsx` only accepted the bare-string shape and
    attached a dead `visible()` closure no renderer ever called — the Expression
    object shape was silently discarded.
  - The form renderer destructured `visibleOn` out of the field config and never
    evaluated it.
  - `RecordFormPage` dropped a `simple` form view's `sections` entirely, so
    page-mode create/edit fell back to the raw schema (every field, no authored
    selection/grouping) while the modal path honored the same view.
  - `ObjectForm`'s grouped-sections path matched section fields by name only,
    dropping per-field `visibleOn` overrides.

  `visibleOn` now flows through normalization verbatim (both wire shapes) and is
  evaluated reactively by the form renderer with the canonical expression engine
  (`evalFieldPredicate` — same engine, record scope, and fail-open semantics as
  field-level `visibleWhen`; both predicates must allow a field for it to show).
  Sectioned/flat normalization also copies field-level `visibleWhen` /
  `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` rules it previously lost.

- 1e9145d: Hydrate widget types on hand-authored master-detail subform columns. A view can
  list a child grid's columns as bare `{ field, label }` (the common authoring
  form); previously such untyped columns were passed straight to the grid, so a
  `select` / `lookup` / `date` / `number` field silently rendered as a plain text
  cell. `MasterDetailForm` (and `deriveDetail`) now resolve each untyped column's
  `type` (plus `options` / `reference` / computed `expr`) from the child object's
  schema via the new `hydrateColumns` helper — a picklist becomes a dropdown, a
  lookup a record picker, a date a date input — while preserving the author's
  exact column set, order and labels. Columns that already declare a `type` are
  left untouched (the author's explicit choice still wins).

### Patch Changes

- 4aa8b84: fix(plugin-form): call `useRecordContext` unconditionally; drop impure render-time `Date.now()`

  `LineItemsPanel` wrapped `useRecordContext()` in a `try/catch`, which ESLint flagged
  as `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` ("React Hook is called conditionally") — a genuine
  hook-order hazard if the `catch` ever fired part-way through render. `useRecordContext`
  returns `null` outside a `<RecordContextProvider>` and never throws, so the guard was
  dead code; it's now called unconditionally at the top level and the `null` case is
  handled by the existing optional chaining.

  Also clears a second pre-existing lint error: `EmbeddableForm` now seeds `mountedAtRef`
  from `0` instead of calling the impure `Date.now()` during render (the mount effect
  already overwrites it before any submit, so the anti-bot min-fill check is unchanged),
  fixing the react-compiler "Cannot call impure function during render" error. No
  behavior change.

### Patch Changes

- aae8791: Flow Screen preview: render inline master-detail subforms (follow-up to #1944)

  The object-form mode of the Screen-node preview now renders inline master-detail
  child grids, matching runtime. `ScreenPreview` feeds the SAME enriched object
  list the runtime `FlowRunner` uses (`useMetadata().objects`, which derives
  `form.subforms` from `inlineEdit` relationships via `attachInlineSubforms`), so
  e.g. a `showcase_invoice` object-form step previews its **Line Items** grid
  (with live Subtotal/Tax/Total) — only fetched in object-form mode.

  To keep the preview non-persisting — consistent with the flat-field preview
  (disabled Submit) and the simple object-form preview (no Save) — `MasterDetailForm`
  now honours a `showSubmit` flag (default shown; backward-compatible) that
  `ObjectForm` forwards, so the preview hides the master-detail Save bar. Also drops
  a dead `e = formData` assignment in `ObjectForm` (lint `no-useless-assignment`).

### Minor Changes

- 5332639: feat(app-shell): render full object forms (incl. master-detail) in screen-flow wizard steps

  `FlowRunner` now renders an `object-form` screen step: when the paused screen
  carries `kind: 'object-form'`, it mounts the real `<ObjectForm>` for the named
  object (auto-routing to `MasterDetailForm` for inline child collections),
  prefilled from the step's `defaults`. The form persists itself (atomic
  master-detail batch), then resumes the run with the saved record id bound to the
  step's `idVariable`. `dataSource`/`objects` are threaded through all three
  `FlowRunner` mount points.

  Also fixes three pre-existing bugs this surfaced (each affects normal forms too):

  - **plugin-form**: `ObjectForm` now forwards `initialValues`/`initialData` when
    routing to `MasterDetailForm`, so prefilled header values are no longer
    dropped on master-detail create forms.
  - **fields**: `PercentField` treated values as `0–1` fractions (`value × 100`),
    so a `0–100` field (e.g. `probability` default `50`) rendered as `5000%` —
    exceeding `max=100`, which makes HTML5 constraint validation mark the field
    `:invalid` and silently block the whole form's submit. It now treats a field
    declaring `max > 1` as the `0–100` whole-number convention, matching the
    read-side formatter.
  - **data-objectstack**: `ObjectStackAdapter.batchTransaction` now sends
    `credentials: 'include'`, so master-detail batch saves authenticate under the
    console's cookie session (previously every batch save 401'd).

- 80c133c: Spreadsheet-style line-item grid editor.

  `GridField`'s editable grid mode is reworked into an enterprise line-item editor (the QuickBooks / Stripe / NetSuite pattern), generalised across every inline grid:

  - **Computed read-only columns** — a child field with an arithmetic `expression` (e.g. `amount = quantity * unit_price`) renders read-only, recomputes live as its inputs change, and writes the result back into the row so it persists and the running total reflects it. A small safe arithmetic evaluator (`+ - * / %`, parens, `record.<field>` refs; no `eval`) powers it.
  - **Trailing "ghost" row** — start-with-one + auto-append: typing in the ghost materialises a real row (index-stable, so focus/caret survive), so you keep entering lines without clicking "Add".
  - **Borderless click-to-focus cells** + role-based column widths (description flexes; qty/price/amount stay narrow).
  - **Keyboard navigation** — Enter / ArrowUp / ArrowDown move between rows in the same column.
  - Per-row "expand to full form" is gated to grids that omit fields (no redundant expand on thin lines).
  - `deriveColumns` surfaces a field `expression` as a computed column; the running-total column prefers the computed/last-currency column. Blank/ghost rows are filtered from the persisted batch (`isBlankRow`).

- d16566f: Atomic master-detail create via the cross-object transactional batch endpoint (ObjectStack #1604).

  When the server exposes the transactional batch endpoint, a NEW parent record and its child line items are now persisted in ONE server transaction — commit all or roll back all — instead of the previous client-orchestrated "create parent → create children → best-effort cleanup on failure" sequence.

  **`@object-ui/data-objectstack` — `ObjectStackAdapter.batchTransaction(operations)`**

  - New method posting `{ operations }` to `POST /api/v1/batch`. Operations run in one server transaction. A field value of `{ $ref: <earlier op index> }` resolves to that op's generated id, so a child can reference its parent created earlier in the same batch (master-detail FK). Throws `ObjectStackError('BATCH_ERROR')` on a non-2xx response.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-form`**

  - `MasterDetailForm` now detects `dataSource.batchTransaction` and, on a NEW parent, builds one atomic batch (parent at index 0, each child FK set to `{ $ref: 0 }`) via the new pure helper `buildMasterDetailBatch`. Client-side total rollups are merged into the parent payload before the batch. Edit mode and adapters without `batchTransaction` keep the existing client-orchestrated path.
  - `ObjectForm` gained a `submitHandler` hook: when supplied, the form validates and hands the collected values to the host instead of calling `dataSource.create` / `dataSource.update`. `MasterDetailForm` uses it to own the atomic parent+children write while the parent fields are still rendered by `ObjectForm`.

  **`@object-ui/types`**

  - `ObjectFormSchema.submitHandler?: (values) => any | Promise<any>` — typed override for host-owned persistence.

  Pairs with the framework-side ambient-transaction fix (ObjectQL `AsyncLocalStorage` transaction propagation) and the `/api/v1/batch` endpoint added in `@objectstack/rest`.

- 69510df: feat(master-detail): derive child columns + relationship FK from metadata

  A master-detail child collection can now be configured with **just the child
  object name** — the relationship FK and the editable grid columns are derived
  from the child object's schema (via `DataSource.getObjectSchema`), instead of a
  hand-authored columns block.

  ```ts
  // before: ~40 lines of columns + relationshipField
  details: [{ childObject: 'task', relationshipField: 'project', columns: [ ...12 lines... ] }]
  // after:
  details: [{ childObject: 'task' }]
  ```

  - `relationshipField` is auto-detected from the child's `master_detail`/`lookup`
    field that references the parent (master_detail preferred).
  - `columns` are derived from the child's fields, skipping system/audit fields,
    the back-reference FK, and non-editable types (formula/summary/autonumber/
    file/json/…); select options and lookup references carry through.
  - `amountField` (running-total source) defaults to the first numeric/currency
    column.
  - Any of these can still be set explicitly to override the derived defaults.
  - Save is gated until derivation resolves; new pure helpers
    (`deriveDetail`/`deriveColumns`/`findRelationshipField`) are unit-tested.

- b148daf: feat(master-detail): atomic EDIT via the cross-object batch endpoint

  Edit mode now persists the parent update together with its child line-item
  create/update/delete diffs in ONE server transaction (commit all or roll back
  all), matching what create already did. Previously only create used the atomic
  `/api/v1/batch` path; edit fell back to client-orchestrated writes with
  best-effort cleanup.

  - New pure helper `buildMasterDetailEditBatch(parentObject, parentId,
parentData, details)` — emits a parent `update` op (index 0) then diffs each
    child collection against its loaded snapshot into `create` / `update` /
    `delete` ops (children reference the known parent id directly, no `$ref`).
  - `MasterDetailForm` now treats `canBatch` as available whenever the data
    source exposes `batchTransaction` (create AND edit). `submitViaBatch` builds
    create-ops or edit-ops by mode; `onSuccess` → `handleSaved` ("saved" toast,
    no form reset in edit).

  The server `/api/v1/batch` handler already supports `update`/`delete` actions,
  and the adapter already forwards `action`/`id`, so this is a front-end change.
  Unit-tested (parent update + child create/update/delete diff); the create path
  remains verified by the live e2e.

- 90acb7f: Master-detail subform + lightweight list primitives (SDUI).

  - `MasterDetailForm` (`object-master-detail-form`): enter a parent record and its child line items together; client-orchestrated transactional create (parent → FK → bulk children → rollup → cleanup). Enterprise-convention layout (header on top, line grid, single Save bar at the bottom).
  - `LineItemsField` editable child grid (line numbers, right-aligned numerics, running total) and `LineItemsPanel` (`record:line_items`) for detail-page inline edit.
  - `element:definition-list` and `element:repeater` — lightweight, low-chrome list primitives for simple data.

- 00f8d2d: Master-detail form: live Subtotal / Tax / Total stack.

  `MasterDetailForm` now renders a right-aligned document totals stack under the line items when the parent form has a tax-rate field (`taxRateField`, default `tax_rate`): **Subtotal** (Σ line amounts) → **Tax** (header rate %) → **Total**, recomputed live as lines and the rate change. The header rate is read via scoped event delegation on the form host (no coupling into `ObjectForm` internals). When the stack is shown, the per-grid footer total is subsumed.

- 300d755: feat(form): inline master-detail in a plain ObjectForm via `subforms`

  `ObjectFormSchema` gains a `subforms` array. When set, a regular `object-form`
  renders as a master-detail form — the object's own fields on top, an editable
  grid per child collection below, persisted together in one atomic transaction —
  without a bespoke `object-master-detail-form` page.

  ```ts
  { type: 'object-form', objectName: 'expense_claim',
    subforms: [{ childObject: 'expense_line' }] }   // FK + columns auto-derived
  ```

  Each subform needs only `childObject` (relationship FK and columns are derived
  from the child object's metadata; override with `relationshipField`/`columns`).
  This is the config-driven, page-less way to express master-detail entry — a form
  view can declare its child collections directly.

- 18728c1: Master-detail entry: lighter layout, compact lookup cells, persisted line order.

  - **De-framed line-item section** — the subform no longer double-frames the grid in a `Card` (border + `p-6`); it renders as a light label + the grid's own bordered table, reclaiming the width the line table needs.
  - **Compact lookup cells** — `LookupField` gains a `compact` mode (used by grid cells): the selected value shows inline in a borderless single-line trigger instead of a chip stacked above a separate "Select…" button.
  - **Persisted drag-reorder** — `deriveMasterDetail` detects a sort field (`position`/`sort_order`/…), excludes it from the editable columns/row-form, and threads it as the grid's `sort_field` so reordering stamps `row[position] = index` and survives a reload.

- 8426db7: feat(form): standard New/Edit modal renders form-view subforms (Tier 0)

  The console's standard create/edit record modal now renders inline child
  collections when the object's form view declares `subforms` — master-detail
  entry with **no bespoke page**, persisted as one atomic transaction.

  - `ModalForm` (and the create/edit modal in app-shell `AppContent`) detects
    `subforms` and renders `MasterDetailForm` inside the dialog (it owns its Save
    bar; the modal footer is suppressed); on success the modal closes + refreshes.
  - `AppContent` sources `subforms` from the object's default form view
    (`form.subforms` / `formViews.default.subforms`).
  - `ModalFormSchema` gains `subforms`.

  With this, declaring `formViews.default.subforms: [{ childObject }]` is enough
  to make an object's standard New/Edit screen a master-detail form — completing
  the config-driven master-detail story (Tier 0 → derive everything from the
  relationship + child metadata).

### Patch Changes

- ddbe4a2: B2 step 3: client-side field-level conditional rules (`visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen`). The form renderer now evaluates these CEL predicates reactively against the live record and gates each field's visibility, read-only state, and required-ness accordingly. Evaluation delegates to the canonical `@objectstack/formula` `ExpressionEngine` — the _same_ dialect the server enforces (`requiredWhen` in the rule-validator, `readonlyWhen` in `stripReadonlyWhenFields`) — so the UX and the persisted verdict always agree. New core helpers `evalFieldPredicate` / `resolveFieldRuleState` (zero-React, fail-open). `FormField` gains `visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` (+ deprecated `conditionalRequired` alias), and `ObjectForm` carries them through from object metadata.
- 2d47e94: B2 follow-ups (A): field conditional rules in inline grids + submit-time enforcement.

  - **Grids**: a line-item column's `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` CEL rule is now honored per row — `deriveMasterDetail` carries the props onto the `GridColumn` and `GridField` evaluates them against each row via `resolveFieldRuleState` (a `readonlyWhen`-TRUE cell locks; a `requiredWhen`-TRUE empty cell flags inline-invalid). Rules are row-scoped (`record.*`); the core helpers gained an optional `scope` (and `GridField` a `contextRecord` prop) so a future header-driven lock can bind `parent.*` — that wiring is deferred (it needs the master-detail header's re-renders isolated).
  - **Submit enforcement**: `requiredWhen` already drove react-hook-form's `required` rule, so submit is blocked with a field error when the predicate is TRUE and the value is empty. Added a reactive cleanup so a stale _required_ error clears when the predicate flips FALSE (and all errors clear when a field is hidden by `visibleWhen`).

- f6044fa: feat(form): subforms in DrawerForm + full-page record form (Tier 0 everywhere)

  Completes config-driven master-detail across all standard create/edit entry
  points (after the modal in the previous change):

  - `DrawerForm` now hosts `MasterDetailForm` inside the drawer when the schema
    declares `subforms` (its own Save bar; closes + refreshes on success).
  - `RecordFormPage` (full-page New/Edit) sources `subforms` from the object's
    form view, so the full-page form renders inline child collections too.
  - `ObjectForm`'s subforms shortcut now defers to the drawer/modal variants for
    those formTypes (so they keep their envelope), and only renders the
    master-detail form directly for inline/simple forms.

  Declaring `formViews.default.subforms: [{ childObject }]` now yields a
  master-detail experience in the modal, drawer, AND full-page form — no bespoke
  page anywhere.

- ad8ade6: feat(components): metadata-derived field locators on generated forms (ADR-0054 Phase 4)

  The form renderer now emits a stable `data-testid="field:{objectName}.{field}"`
  (plus `data-field`) on every field wrapper, derived from the form's `objectName`
  and each field's name — closing the locator gap at the source so every generated
  form (`ObjectForm`/`ModalForm`/`DrawerForm`/`SplitForm`/`WizardForm`) inherits
  testable fields with zero per-app work (ADR-0054 C4). `FormSchema` gains an
  optional `objectName`; the object prefix is omitted (`field:{field}`) when a form
  has none. `FormItem` now accepts `data-*` attributes.

- 3870c20: feat(forms): declarative `navigateOnSuccess` + `resetOnSuccess` on object-form

  Rounds out declarative success behavior for metadata-only forms (which can't
  pass an `onSuccess` function), complementing `successMessage`:

  - **`navigateOnSuccess`** — after a successful create/update, navigate here.
    Supports `{id}`/`{recordId}` interpolation from the saved record and is
    same-origin-guarded; takes precedence over the toast (landing on the record
    is the confirmation).
  - **`resetOnSuccess`** — after a successful create, reset the form for another
    entry (the wizard returns to a cleared step 1). Ignored when navigating.

  Wired in both ObjectForm and WizardForm via a small shared `successBehavior`
  helper (kept dependency-free to avoid an EmbeddableForm import cycle).

- b88c560: feat(forms): declarative `successMessage` on object-form

  Metadata-only forms (a wizard/object-form authored as JSON) cannot pass an
  `onSuccess` function, so the post-create/update feedback was a fixed
  "Created"/"Saved" toast. `ObjectFormSchema` now accepts `successMessage`, which
  ObjectForm and WizardForm use for the default success toast when no `onSuccess`
  handler is supplied. Falls back to "Created"/"Saved".

- 7913390: fix(master-detail): never silent on save — feedback, reset, and a duplicate-submit guard

  `MasterDetailForm`'s "Create" submitted successfully but gave **no feedback**: no toast, no form reset, no navigation. A successful create looked broken, and re-clicking created duplicate records.

  - On success: a `toast.success`, and on create the form clears (line items reset + parent `<ObjectForm>` remounts) ready for the next entry. A page-supplied `onSuccess` still runs afterwards (e.g. to navigate).
  - On failure (validation / network / atomic rollback): a `toast.error` surfaces the message instead of failing silently.
  - In-flight guard: the Create button shows "Saving…" and is disabled while a submit is running, preventing duplicate submissions, with a safety release if client-side validation blocks the submit.
  - `@object-ui/components` now re-exports `toast` (alongside `Toaster`) from its sonner wrapper.

  Tests: two new `MasterDetailForm` tests assert success → toast + form clear, and failure → error toast.

- 514f426: fix(master-detail): reliable submit + stable e2e hooks

  Fixes the "click Create, nothing happens" report, surfaced by a new live browser
  e2e harness that drives the form with real input.

  - **MasterDetailForm `handleSave`** now triggers the button-less parent form's
    submit from a deferred macrotask and re-queries the live `<form>` inside it.
    Calling `requestSubmit()` synchronously inside the click handler (right after
    the `setSaving` state update) intermittently dropped the nested submit event,
    so react-hook-form's `onSubmit` never ran and the click appeared to do nothing
    — only the occasional click got through. Deferring makes it fire every time.
  - **Stable `data-testid`s** so automation/e2e can drive the widgets
    deterministically (Radix Select + react-hook-form cannot be driven by
    synthetic DOM events): `select-trigger-{field}` / `select-option-{value}`
    (SelectField), `lookup-trigger-{field}` (LookupField), `line-items-add`
    (GridField), `md-form-submit` / `md-form-cancel` (MasterDetailForm).

- 586a027: B2 follow-up (#1581): parent-scoped conditional rules in inline grids — "paid invoice → lock lines". `MasterDetailForm` now binds the live header record to every line-item grid as `parent`, so a column's `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` CEL rule can react to the header (e.g. `parent.status == 'paid'` locks quantity / unit price / product when the invoice is paid). The line grids + document totals moved into a dedicated `<MasterDetailLines>` child that owns the scraped header record, so a header edit re-renders only the lines and never resets the header `ObjectForm`'s react-hook-form state mid-edit; the scrape is deduped by value to avoid needless churn. (`@object-ui/fields`' `GridField.contextRecord` and column-rule derivation already existed — this wires the last link.)
- 9aac2b8: feat(form): modal forms can host a tabbed layout (modal + tabbed composes)

  `ModalForm` rendered sections as a flat vertical stack — a modal create/edit
  form could never be tabbed, because `formType` (one field) couldn't be both
  `modal` (container) and `tabbed` (layout). Per ADR-0050 (additive first), the
  modal container now accepts a `contentLayout` ('simple' | 'tabbed'): when
  `tabbed`, sections render as tabs inside the dialog. The console record
  New/Edit modal (`AppContent`) forwards the default form view's layout, so a
  `type:'tabbed'` form view now renders tabbed in the modal too — not just on the
  full-page route (#1762). Non-breaking; `FormView.type` enum unchanged.

- 650bd1f: fix(forms/dashboard/related-list): four business-facing rendering fixes found while QA-ing a showcase workspace

  - **plugin-form / WizardForm**: a multi-step `object-form` with `formType: 'wizard'` posted an empty/partial body on submit, so the server rejected every required field. Two causes: (1) the footer Next/Create buttons bypassed the inner form and submitted the wizard's own (never-collected) `formData`; (2) the create-mode data-seeding effect re-ran on `dataSource`/`objectSchema` identity churn and reset `formData` to `{}` mid-wizard. Now the buttons submit the inner form natively (`<form id>` + `type="submit"`, which validates each step and collects values via `getValues()`), and the create seed is made idempotent.
  - **plugin-dashboard / DashboardRenderer**: chart widgets rendered as empty cards (recharts logged `width(-1) height(-1)`) because the positioned grid used `auto-rows-min`, collapsing any widget with no intrinsic height. The explicit-columns grid now uses `gridAutoRows: minmax(5rem, auto)` so spanned chart rows get a real height while tables can still grow.
  - **plugin-detail / RelatedList**: auto-derived related-list columns led with system audit fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`, …) for child objects without a name/title field, pushing business columns past the column cap. System audit fields are now sorted last.
  - **plugin-form / ObjectForm + WizardForm**: a successful create/update gave no feedback for metadata-only pages (which can't pass an `onSuccess` function). They now show a default `toast.success('Created'/'Saved')` when no `onSuccess` handler is supplied (guarded so a `submitHandler` host like MasterDetailForm never double-toasts).

### Minor Changes

- c0b236f: Platform detail/form polish:
  - **Auto-section grouping**: When an object has no authored `views.form.sections`, the detail page now splits fields into a primary section and a collapsible "More details" section based on a field-type/name heuristic (textarea / markdown / description / notes / remarks). Eliminates the wall-of-fields layout on objects without explicit detail metadata.
  - **FormSection card chrome**: `FormSection` now accepts `showBorder`. Defaults to `true` for titled sections (Card wrapper) and `false` for untitled sections (flat). Same auto-default already applied to `DetailSection`.
  - **Origin breadcrumb**: Navigating from a list/kanban into a record now records the source view; the detail page shows a `← <view label>` back-link above the page header.
  - New i18n key `detail.sectionMoreDetails` (en + zh-CN).

### Patch Changes

- a311e22: Fix EmbeddableForm rendering no inputs on the public-form path. When the
  caller passes a `fields: string[]` list (e.g. the response from
  `GET /api/v1/forms/:slug`) the inner `ObjectForm` now receives a
  read-only wrapper of the data source — preserving `getObjectSchema()`
  so it can materialise widgets, while neutralising mutating ops so all
  backend writes still go through `EmbeddableForm.handleSubmit` (and its
  consent / honeypot / min-fill / redirect / payload-sanitisation gates).

### Patch Changes

- 89ae109: Fix click navigation and required-FK form rendering

  - **plugin-grid**: ObjectGrid's `getSelectFields()` now always includes `id` in
    the SELECT projection. Previously, when a view configured `columns` without
    `id`, the SQL driver stripped it from results, and row-click handlers silently
    no-oped because `record.id` was undefined.
  - **plugin-form / fields**: Master-detail fields now render as a single-value
    lookup picker (`LookupField`) in create/edit forms instead of a one-to-many
    related-list widget. From the child-side, master-detail is the FK to the
    parent record and is typically NOT NULL — it must appear in forms. Prior
    behavior dropped it via the auto-layout exclusion list, which caused server
    errors like "NOT NULL constraint failed: contact.account" when users tried
    to create child records.

## 4.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 1dc6061: fix(build): inline dynamic imports in library outputs

  Library `vite build --lib` outputs were emitting separate code-split chunks
  (`rolldown-runtime-*.js`, `LookupField-*.js`, etc.) when source files used
  `React.lazy()` / dynamic `import()`. When consumer apps re-bundled these
  multi-file dists, the library's per-chunk rolldown-runtime collided with the
  consumer's own runtime, causing "TypeError: i is not a function" at runtime
  when lazy components tried to register themselves (e.g. TextField in
  `@object-ui/fields` after 4.0.4).

  Adding `output.inlineDynamicImports: true` to all `@object-ui/*` library vite
  configs forces a single `dist/index.js` per package, which lets consumer
  bundlers handle the library as an opaque ESM module without identifier
  mismatches across chunks.

  Affected packages: components, fields, layout, plugin-aggrid, plugin-ai,
  plugin-calendar, plugin-charts, plugin-chatbot, plugin-dashboard,
  plugin-designer, plugin-detail, plugin-editor, plugin-form, plugin-gantt,
  plugin-grid, plugin-kanban, plugin-list, plugin-map, plugin-markdown,
  plugin-report, plugin-timeline, plugin-view, plugin-workflow.

## 4.0.4

### Patch Changes

- d2b6ece: fix: externalize all bare imports in library builds

  Library builds (vite lib mode) now externalize every non-relative import instead of bundling third-party CJS dependencies into the published dist. This avoids inlined `require("react")` / `require("react-dom")` calls that cause `Calling \`require\` for "react" in an environment that doesn't expose the \`require\` function` runtime errors when consumer apps re-bundle the published dist.

  Specifically fixes:

  - `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` no longer inlines `react-grid-layout` (and its transitive `react-draggable` / `react-resizable` CJS bundles). `react-grid-layout` is now declared as a peer dependency so consumers install a single ESM-friendly copy.
  - `@object-ui/components`, `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/plugin-charts`, `@object-ui/plugin-designer` no longer inline `react-i18next` / `i18next` / `use-sync-external-store` CJS shims.
  - All plugin packages now use a unified `external: (id) => !/^[./]/.test(id) && !id.startsWith(__dirname)` rule, ensuring future additions of CJS deps are automatically externalized.

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).

## 3.4.0

### Patch Changes

- de881ef: Mobile UX round 3 — Form: sticky save bar, fullscreen long-text editor, and auto-stepper for long forms on small viewports.

  **`@object-ui/types`** — `ObjectFormSchema.mobile` (new) lets a single form opt into all three behaviours:

  ```ts
  {
    type: 'object-form',
    objectName: 'leads',
    mode: 'create',
    mobile: {
      stickyActions: true,        // pin Submit/Cancel to bottom on phones
      stepper: 'auto',            // long forms render one field per step
      stepperMinFields: 8,        // …but only past this many fields
      stepperFieldsPerStep: 1,    // … (default 1)
      fullscreenLongText: true,   // textarea fields get an "expand" affordance
    },
  }
  ```

  `FormSchema.mobileStickyActions` (new) is the lower-level escape hatch — applied automatically when `mobile.stickyActions` is set on `ObjectFormSchema`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-form`** — `ObjectForm` now:

  - propagates `mobile.fullscreenLongText` to every textarea/markdown/html field as `mobile_fullscreen: true`,
  - sets `mobileStickyActions` on the inner form schema and adds `pb-20` padding so content isn't covered by the fixed bar,
  - when `mobile.stepper === true` (or `'auto'` + `useIsMobile()` + > `stepperMinFields` fields), routes the flat field list through the existing `WizardForm` with synthetic single-field "steps" — keeping per-step validation and the existing `Next`/`Back`/`Submit` flow.

  **`@object-ui/components`** — the registered `form` renderer adds:

  - a `mobileStickyActions` opt-in that turns the action row into a `position: sticky; bottom: 0` bar on small viewports, and
  - an inline `FullscreenTextarea` wrapper used when no field-package widget is registered, providing the same expand-button + edit-dialog UX so the feature works even in lighter setups.

  **`@object-ui/fields`** — `TextAreaField` ships the actual fullscreen UX: a top-right `Maximize2` button opens a near-fullscreen `Dialog` containing a full-height `Textarea` with a draft-then-commit save model (Cancel reverts).

  All three behaviours are off by default — existing forms render unchanged.
