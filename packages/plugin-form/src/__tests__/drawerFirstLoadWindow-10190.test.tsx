/**
 * `DrawerForm` offers no editable form for a record whose FIRST read has not
 * landed (objectui#10190).
 *
 * The drawer already refused this for a record SWAP (`recordSwapLoading.test.tsx`)
 * but not for the first load: the fetch effect and the fields effect both key
 * on `objectSchema`, so the commit that publishes the schema runs both — the
 * fetch effect enters the loading state and fires `findOne`, and the fields
 * effect, declared after it, used to end the loading state unconditionally.
 * The form painted empty and editable while the read was in flight, and the
 * record landing replaced whatever had been typed: the value was gone from the
 * screen and from the submit, with no warning and no dirty flag.
 *
 * `findOne` is held open here by the test, so the window is deterministic
 * rather than a race against the worker's load — which is how it surfaced, as
 * an order-dependent red in `fieldSecurityPayload.test.tsx`.
 *
 * The last case is the CONTROL that separates the two readings the card
 * named. A stale submit closure would lose a value typed AFTER the record
 * landed too; it does not, so the loss is the landing record replacing the
 * form's values, i.e. the window this file pins shut.
