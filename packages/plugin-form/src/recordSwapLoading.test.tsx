/**
 * Swapping `recordId` on a MOUNTED sectioned form must not show the old record.
 *
 * `loading` in these four containers was only ever set `true` once, by
 * `useState(true)`, and thereafter only ever set `false`. So a `recordId` change
 * re-entered the fetch effect WITHOUT going back through the loading branch: the
 * form stayed mounted showing — and accepting edits to — record A's values, with
 * no indication that a different record had been asked for, until B's response
 * landed and replaced them in place. Anything typed in that window belonged to A
 * on screen and to B on submit.
 *
 * The same effect also had no staleness guard, so two overlapping fetches landed
 * in COMPLETION order rather than request order: ask for B then C, and a slow B
 * arriving last left the form showing B while the caller had asked for C.
 *
 * Both are the same defect from the user's side — the form displays a record
 * nobody asked for — so both are pinned here. `ObjectForm` already did the right
 * thing (it re-enters loading before the fetch), which is why this only ever
 * reproduced on the sectioned variants.
 *
 * `WizardForm` got the staleness guard (objectui#10712) but not the loading
 * half, so a swap left the previous record's values drawn and editable on the
 * current step while the new read was in flight (objectui#10726). It is a row
 * of the swap table below, and a create-mode control of its own.

 * hands JSX a UNION of their component types, and JSX resolves a union of

 * right one for the case actually running. Ten of this package's thirteen
 * unchecked-test errors were that one collision, reported as
 * `Type 'any' is not assignable to type 'never'`.
 *
 * Naming the surface the parametrisation really exercises — the same two props
 * against each container — is what makes the suite expressible. `schema` is
 * deliberately `any` here and cannot be anything else: assigning
 * `React.FC< ModalFormProps >` to a shared component type requires the shared
 * schema type to be assignable to `ModalFormSchema` AND `DrawerFormSchema` AND
 * every other one at once, which nothing but `any` satisfies. That is a fact
 * about these containers having no common props base, not a cast hiding a
 * mismatch: the `formType` each case passes is checked below instead.
