/**
 * objectui#9925 — `record:reference_rail` spent each entry's preview-row cap
 * with a bare `??`, and `??` rejects only `null`/`undefined`, so a value the
 * contract refuses survived as a real fetch window and reached the adapter as
 * `$top`.
 *
 * ## Why this site is in the card at all
 *
 * The card names three blocks and derives its population by CONCEPT, not by one
 * identifier. Inside this package the concept turns up at five read points, and
 * four of them already refuse a non-positive value before it reaches `$top`
 * (`record:related_list` tests the number is positive; `record:history` and
 * `record:activity` floor theirs). This entry was the one that did not, so it
 * is the one this file pins.
 *
 * ## Why "refuse it" is not this file inventing a meaning
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` already answers what `limit: 0` means: the rail entry's
 * own member is declared a POSITIVE INTEGER on `ReferenceRailEntrySchema`
 * (`z.number().int().positive().optional()`, described there as the `$top` of
 * the one query the entry issues). So `0` is not a spelling whose meaning a
 * consumer may choose; it is a value the contract refuses.
 *
 * ## Why the silence matters more here than at the two sibling sites
 *
 * This rail degrades silently by design — a failed or empty entry renders "—"
 * rather than blanking the rail — so an entry asked for nothing draws a card
 * that looks merely empty. There is no on-screen channel to say it on, which is
 * why the diagnostic assertions below are not decoration.
 *
 * ## What the assertions are, and what each control buys
 *
 * The subject is the RELATION, never a literal: a refused value does not reach
 * `$top` and the site's own default does. Each refusal is paired with a control
 * that must NOT fire, so a rail that ignores the member entirely cannot pass
 * for a measurement and an always-on diagnostic cannot pass for a diagnosis.
