/**
 * Home's "Needs your attention" rows follow a notification's deep link INTO an
 * app (objectui#5179).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `action_url` is **app-relative** by contract. The producer says so in as many
 * words — `service-messaging`'s `actionUrlFor()` synthesizes
 * `/{object}/{id}` "so the materialization is self-sufficient for navigation
 * (ADR-0030 L5)" — and its own pins carry that shape (`/showcase_task/t_42`,
 * `/opportunities/42`). It names a RECORD, not a console route: the app that
 * hosts it is the client's to resolve, exactly as for `sys_inbox_message` and
 * `sys_activity` next door.
 *
 * `onOpenNotification` navigated `n.actionUrl` verbatim, so the app-relative
 * path was handed to the router as if it were absolute. `/showcase_task/t_42`
 * matches no route, the console's catch-all (`apps/console/src/App.tsx`,
 * `<Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/" replace />} />`) forwards it to
 * `/`, and `RootLandingRedirect` resolves that to `/apps/<default app>` — the
 * app landing page, which is precisely what the card reports.
 *
 * ## Why the existing pin did not catch it
 *
 * `HomePage.inboxLinksTarget.test.tsx`'s CONTROL case seeds
 * `actionUrl: '/apps/acme/invoice/42'` — a path already carrying its `/apps/`
 * segment, i.e. the one shape that survives being navigated verbatim. The
 * producer never emits it. These cases seed the shape the producer actually
 * emits.
 *
 * ## What these cases assert
 *
 * The RESOLVED TARGET — the argument `navigate()` receives — per the card's
 * ruling that a test asserting only "navigation happened" passes against the
 * bug. Nothing about the far end: whether the record renders is the card's
 * second, already-verified control.

/* ── The `_drafts` double (objectui#7307) ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Every render of `HomePage` below mounts `PendingDraftsBanner`, which reads the
 * env-wide pending-draft count through `usePendingDrafts({})`. That hook fetches
 * `GET /api/v1/meta/_drafts` with the GLOBAL `fetch` — `usePendingDrafts.ts:48`,
 * no `apiFetch` seam anywhere on the path — from its mount effect
 * (`usePendingDrafts.ts:116` via `refresh` at `:94`). Under happy-dom that global
 * is a real HTTP client and the document URL defaults to `http://localhost:3000`,
 * so the relative path resolved to a live socket, once per case. The hook's read
 * is best-effort (its `catch` leaves `count` at `null`), which is why these cases
 * stayed green while the request always failed.
 *
 * Answered from a RECORDING double — the shape objectui#5225 settled on, carried
 * by `packages/plugin-report/src/__tests__/DatasetReportRenderer.test.tsx` and by
 * this burn-down's earlier batches. Deliberately NOT a blanket network stub: it
 * records every URL it is handed and `afterEach` fails on any URL outside the set
 * it serves, so an escape to somewhere else reds here instead of vanishing into
 * that `catch`.
 *
 * What it answers, and why that changes no assertion here: a known-EMPTY draft
 * ledger, in the `{ drafts: [...] }` envelope `fetchPendingDrafts` reads (the one
 * `MetadataClient.listDrafts` pins for this endpoint; the bare-array and
 * `{ data: { drafts } }` shapes parse to the same rows). Empty rather than seeded
 * is load-bearing: `PendingDraftsBanner` renders `null` when `(count ?? 0) <= 0`,
 * and the failing request produced `count === null` — so an empty ledger yields
 * byte-identical output to what these cases have always rendered, while a seeded
 * one would add a banner and a `pending-drafts-publish` button to every case's
 * tree. Routes are matched on the PATHNAME because the hook appends a
 * `?packageId=` scope for package-bound callers; the full URL is what gets
 * recorded.
