 * otherwise the first click on that column produces `asc` while the list was
 * already `desc`, and the arrow tells the truth only from the second click on.
 *
 * ⚠️ This reader is WIDER than the fetch path as of objectui#8767, and the
 * sentence this docblock used to carry — that the fetch path reads all three
 * spellings — is no longer true. The fetch path now REFUSES a string and sends
 * no `$orderby` at all, while this reader still parses `"name desc"` and
 * `["name desc", …]`, so a grid authored with a retired spelling shows an
 * arrow for an ordering its query does not carry. Narrowing this reader moves

   * ## Why this exists
   *
   * `operations` and the `onEdit` / `onDelete` wiring are GRID-level: they say
   * whether the affordance exists at all, identically for every row. A host
   * whose refusal is per RECORD had nowhere to put it, so it put the refusal in
   * the callback instead — `FieldDesigner`'s delete handler returned early on a
   * system field, after the grid had already drawn the button. The two states
   * it was distinguishing (`readOnly`, which withholds the callback, and
   * `isSystem`, which swallowed the click) differed in the code and did not
   * differ on screen: the author clicked a button drawn as available and got no
   * dialog, no toast, no console message. The operation an affordance cannot
   * perform is not offered.
   *
   * ## The contract
   *
   * Called with a row record; returns the overrides for THAT row. It is an
   * INTERSECTION, like every layer around it (the ADR-0103 bucket, the object's
   * `userActions`, the server's effective API operations, the principal's own
   * grant and the record-level explain verdict): `false` WITHHOLDS, and nothing
   * it returns can re-open what those closed. `true`, an omitted member, a
   * `null` / `undefined` return, and an absent prop all leave the verdict
   * exactly as the grid resolved it — so a caller that passes nothing renders
   * what it rendered before this prop existed.
   *
   * Scope is the row's kebab. Bulk delete rides `onBulkDelete` and the object
   * verdict behind the selection bar, which no per-row answer can speak for:
   * one selected row's `false` must not silently drop the other rows' action.

/**
 * Helper to get data configuration from schema.
 *
 * The ruled three-rung ladder itself (`data`, then `staticData`, then
 * `objectName`) is `resolveRecordSourceConfig` in `@object-ui/core` — ONE
 * implementation of a contract published on both faces (objectui#6939), which
 * this file used to hand-copy (objectui#7632).
 *
 * What used to stay here was the head above it: the bare-array `data`
 * shorthand, which lifted `data: [...]` to `{ provider: 'value', items }`.
 * ⛔ IT IS GONE (objectui#8348, decision batch #83, maintainer verbatim
 * 「8348 以协议为准」 — the contract decides).
 *
 * MEASURED on `@objectstack/spec` 17.4.0:
 * `ComponentPropsMap['object-grid'].data` is the `ViewData` union, and its own
 * description names the refusal — *"Static inline rows live at
 * `{ provider: 'value', items: [...] }`; the bare-array shortcut is refused —
 * see migration `object-grid-data-view-data-converged`"*. This block's own
 * registration publishes the same arm (`{ name: 'data', type: 'object' }` in
 * `index.tsx`), and `gridDataInputContract.test.ts` has pinned that declaration
 * since objectui#5090. The head was the last carrier of a spelling every one of
 * those faces refuses, so `data` is honoured here on the OBJECT arm only and
 * the shared rung is passed `'view-data'`.
 *
 * ⛔ WHAT THIS REACHES, measured per CARRIER — do NOT read it as "the array is
 * gone". An authored `data` array reaches this component TWICE: as
 * `schema.data`, which this function used to lift, and as the `data` PROP,
 * because `SchemaRenderer` spreads every non-metadata node key and
 * `index.tsx` forwards `{...rest}`. That prop is `passedData` below, and it
 * lifts an array to `{ provider: 'value', items }` at HIGHER priority than this
 * ladder — it is the channel a host such as `ListView` uses to hand down rows it
 * already fetched, and it is indistinguishable here from an authored key.
 *
 * ⇒ at the ladder the array is no longer a record source; through
 * `SchemaRenderer` an authored `data: [ …rows… ]` still draws, from the props
 * channel. Both halves are pinned in
 * `__tests__/gridBareArrayDataRefused-8348.test.tsx`, which had to correct its
 * own first draft on exactly this point. Collapsing the two carriers would take
 * the host path with it and is outside objectui#8348's scope — reported on the
 * card, not changed in passing.
 *
 * The declared spelling for inline rows is
 * `data: { provider: 'value', items: [...] }`, and the deprecated `staticData`
 * array still works as before.

 * ⭐ WHAT THIS GRID'S COLUMN PRODUCER IS ALLOWED TO EMIT (objectui#6004).
 *
 * `generateColumns()` below builds the column array this component hands to
 * `data-table`, whose slot is `DataTableSchema.columns: TableColumn[]`. It had
 * no return annotation, so its four emit paths were inferred structurally and
 * nothing ever compared them to the slot's declaration — and all four call
 * sites re-widened to `any` on the way out, so even an annotation would have
 * been discarded one hop later.
 *
 * ## ⭐ Why this is not just `: TableColumn[]`
 *
 * objectui#6373 measured, at the sibling producer in `plugin-dashboard`, that a
 * bare `TableColumn` annotation raises no error on a `{ ...spread }` emit,
 * because TypeScript's excess-property check is a FRESHNESS check on the
 * properties an object literal WRITES OUT and spread properties are exempt.
 *
 * Measured again HERE before choosing this shape, because this seam is worse
 * than that one and the difference matters:
 *
 *   1. `generateColumns = useCallback((): TableColumn[] => {`, everything else
 *      unchanged  →  `tsc --noEmit` exit 0, ZERO diagnostics.
 *   2. Same, PLUS an undeclared key `wrapControl: true` WRITTEN OUT in the path-A
 *      column literal (not arriving through a spread)  →  exit 0, ZERO diagnostics.
 *
 * Run 2 is the one that fixes the mechanism. At objectui#6373's seam the object
 * literal sits in `enrich()`'s return position, so freshness still caught keys
 * written out longhand and only the spread escaped. Here every literal is the
 * return value of a `.map()` callback, so it is inferred into the callback's
 * return type FIRST and reaches the annotation as a non-fresh `X[]`. Freshness
 * is gone entirely: written-out keys escape too. A bare annotation at this seam
 * is not a weak instrument, it is an inert one — a green gate and no guard.
 *
 * The `?: never` members are what make the annotation able to fail. They are
 * ADR-0049 retirement tombstones — this repo's convention for a key that is
 * REFUSED rather than merely absent (`StaticTableColumn` in `@object-ui/types`)
 * — and they bite by ASSIGNABILITY, which survives `.map()` because it never
 * depended on freshness. Re-adding `...(col.summary && { summary: col.summary })`
 * to a column literal is a compile error naming `summary`.
 *
 * ## The rule (objectui#6373's, applied to this producer's key set)
 *
 * A producer may write into a `TableColumn[]` slot only keys the CONSUMER of
 * that slot reads, and the read set is MEASURED from the consumer's source,
 * never assumed. A key the consumer reads and `TableColumn` declares is
 * written; a key the consumer reads that `TableColumn` does not declare is HELD
 * where a ruling already holds it; a key nothing reads is RETIRED — never
 * declared, because declaring a key nothing reads is the same
 * `declared != enforced` defect facing the other way. Before retiring, prove
 * the value has a second road to its consumer.
 *
 * Consumers measured for THIS producer — two of them, because the array is read
 * twice before it reaches the slot:
 *
 *   - `data-table.tsx`, comments stripped, every `col.<key>` read — FOURTEEN:
 *     `accessorKey`, `width`, `align`, `header`, `className`, `cellClassName`,
 *     `sortable`, `resizable`, `editable`, `type`, `cell`, `headerIcon`,
 *     `fitContent`, `wrap`. ⚠️ It was THIRTEEN between objectui#7196 and
 *     objectui#6650, which added the `wrap` read this producer now feeds; it
 *     said fourteen before #7196 re-derived it:
 *     `name` was the fourteenth and was correct when written, but objectui#6963
 *     (2026-08-31) retired the `col.name` alias — the last undeclared spelling
 *     the adapter accepted — so the key left the consumer's read set that day.
 *   - THIS FILE's own downstream passes, which read the array before handing it
 *     on — TEN: `pinned` (the left/right reorder + the frozen-column verdict),
 *     `accessorKey`, `header`, `width`, `type`, `fitContent`, plus the four the
 *     chrome passes read in order to RE-EXPRESS them: `className` and
 *     `cellClassName` (`applyDensity`, and again in the right-pinned literal),
 *     `sortable` (`withSortability`), `cell` (the mobile card renderer).
 *     ⚠️ Those four were missing from this list from the day it was written —
 *     all three passes already existed at that commit — so this is an
 *     incompleteness, not drift. They change no verdict: each is declared on
 *     `TableColumn` and read by `data-table.tsx` as well. Recorded because a
 *     list presented as MEASURED has to be one.
 *     ⚠️ `col.wrap` is read ONE MORE TIME here since objectui#6650, at the
 *     `LinkCell` call sites, and that read is not a re-expression of the
 *     forward — it is a SECOND consumer of the same authored key. The record
 *     link wears its own `truncate`, so honouring `wrap` only downstream would
 *     have left column one of almost every grid wrapping its cell body around
 *     text still clamped to one line.
 *
 * Verdicts, each with the read-count behind it:
 *
 *   - `headerIcon` — DECLARED by `TableColumn`, so NOT held. Live:
 *     `data-table.tsx` renders it into the header cell (1 render site, 2
 *     syntactic reads), forwarded verbatim and never re-expressed. It WAS held
 *     here, on the "undeclared by `TableColumn`" premise; objectui#6615
 *     declared it and that premise expired with nothing going red at the moment
 *     of loss. objectui#6424 then removed the hold, MEASURED rather than
 *     derived: with the member deleted both emit types below are byte-identical
 *     (27 members, every member's resolved type unchanged), against a positive
 *     control that deleting `pinned` instead moves them to 26. Pinned in
 *     `columnHoldsExpiry-6424.test.ts` — which now also carries the claim the
 *     hold used to carry implicitly, that `TableColumn` DECLARES the key.
 *   - `pinned` — HELD. Live, and consumed BEFORE the slot: the reorder pass
 *     below reads it (5 reads in this file) and re-expresses it as the sticky
 *     `className` that `data-table` actually reads. `data-table` never reads
 *     `pinned` itself, and does not need to.
 *   - `wrap` — DECLARED by `TableColumn`, forwarded, and READ. This entry was
 *     "RETIRED (objectui#5453, 2026-08-28)" and the retirement was correct on
 *     its own measurement: `data-table.tsx` was then a two-way switch,
 *     `isFit ? 'w-full whitespace-nowrap' : 'truncate w-full'`, with a `title`
 *     tooltip as the only concession to overflow, so nothing read the key and
 *     the emit rule retired it. ⭐ What #5453 could not settle is what
 *     objectui#6650 escalated one level up: `@objectstack/spec` never stopped
 *     DECLARING `ListColumn.wrap`, and describes it to authors as "Allow text
 *     wrapping" — so retiring the forward left a promise made at authoring
 *     time and silently broken at render time. The maintainer ruled that
 *     promise is kept rather than withdrawn (2026-09-02, Option B): the
 *     consumer was BUILT, `TableColumn` now declares the key, and the forward
 *     returns WITH a reader. ⚠️ Note what moved and what did not — the emit
 *     rule is unchanged and still decided this: the key is written because the
 *     consumer reads it, which is the same test that retired it when the
 *     consumer did not exist.
 *   - `options` — RETIRED (see the enrichment pass below).
 *   - `type` — not adjudicated here; objectui#5853 owns its VALUE set and its
 *     fold still stands. It is the one member whose vocabulary differs between
 *     the two types below.
 *   - `name` — not emitted by this producer at all, so objectui#5120's alias
 *     never needed a hold here. Tombstoned only in the sense that nothing writes
 *     it — and since objectui#6963 (2026-08-31) nothing READS it either: the
 *     consumer-side alias is retired, so the key is absent from BOTH ends of
 *     this seam and the verdict now rests on two measurements, not one.
 *
 * `essential` is absent from both types on purpose: objectui#6004's suggested
 * key list named it, but it was READ off the authored column and turned into a
 * `className` — never emitted, and not a `ListColumn` member either. That read
 * is now RETIRED too (objectui#6458), so mobile visibility is decided purely
 * positionally (`colIndex === 0`) and nothing on either side of this producer
 * carries the key.

/**
 * ⭐ THE SCHEMA SLOT THIS GRID FILLS (objectui#6459) — the receiver half of the

 * `const dataTableSchema: any`, so the ~46 keys assembled there were checked
 * against nothing, while the `DataTableSchema` this file imports went unused as
 * that object's annotation.
 *
 * ## Why the fix is not `: DataTableSchema` — measured before choosing this shape
 *
 * objectui#6459's sizing note predicted a bare annotation would be inert
 * because `buildGroupTableSchema` re-emits the value through a spread and
 * excess-property checking is a freshness check. Measured here (on
 * `38a123cac`), the truth is stronger and the spread is not even needed:
 *
 *   1. `const dataTableSchema: DataTableSchema = {`, everything else unchanged,
 *      PLUS an undeclared `bogusKeyForProbe6459: true` WRITTEN OUT LONGHAND in
 *      the (fresh) literal  →  `tsc --noEmit` exit 0, ZERO diagnostics.
 *
 * The reason is `BaseSchema`'s `[key: string]: any` index signature, which
 * `DataTableSchema` inherits: under an index signature EVERY key is a member,
 * so excess-property checking never has a non-member to refuse — at a fresh
 * literal, through a spread, anywhere. It is the terminal case of the rule the
 * `options` tombstone above records ("a pin enforced by a key's non-membership
 * silently stops enforcing the moment the key becomes a member"): with an
 * index signature there is no non-membership to enforce with, ever.
 *
 * `RemoveIndexSignature` strips it — DERIVED from `DataTableSchema`, never a
 * hand-copied member list, so a member added there tomorrow flows in on its
 * own and two enumerations of one vocabulary never exist. With the signature
 * gone, the same probe goes red (TS2353 naming the key), measured at both
 * annotated literals — the flat one and `buildGroupTableSchema`'s return.
 *
 * ## What the instrument is, and is not (pinned in dataTableSchemaSlot-6459.test.ts)
 *
 * Both writers of this type are object literals sitting DIRECTLY in annotated
 * positions (a `const` initializer; an annotated arrow's parenthesized return),
 * so unlike `generateColumns()` — where `.map()` laundered freshness away and
 * only `?: never` tombstones could bite — excess-property checking is live
 * here for longhand keys, and the group literal's spread source is itself the
 * checked `const`, so every key entering that spread was already refused or
 * admitted at ITS literal. What this shape does NOT do is refuse an undeclared
 * key riding a NON-FRESH value assigned into the slot (assignability admits
 * extra keys; that is structural typing, not a bug here) — per-key `?: never`
 * tombstones remain the instrument for a key RETIRED by ruling, but an open
 * census cannot be tombstoned, because a tombstone needs the key's name.
 *
 * ## The census this annotation surfaced — CLOSED, re-derived by objectui#7196
 *
 * Diffing the 46 keys the flat literal writes (plus the 8 the group literal
 * re-writes) against `DataTableSchema` + `BaseSchema` declared members left
 * exactly TWO undeclared keys when this was written. Re-derived on 2026-09-01
 * against the same two literals (still 46 and 8), it now leaves **ZERO**. Both
 * halves closed:
 *
 *   - the card's speculative list (`pagination`, `manualPagination`, `rowCount`,
 *     `frozenColumns`, `singleClickEdit`, `selectionResetKey`,
 *     `disableInnerScroll`, `borderless`) was already declared then, and is
 *     still declared now;
 *   - the two keys that survived that diff, `renderCellEditor` and
 *     `cellClassName`, were DECLARED by objectui#6882 (maintainer ruling
 *     2026-08-30) on three surfaces:
 *       · `packages/types/src/data-display.ts` — the members themselves
 *       · `packages/types/src/zod/data-display.zod.ts` — the Zod mirror
 *       · `packages/types/src/__tests__/data-table-declared-keys-6882.test.ts`
 *         — an `Equal` (not `extends`) exact-shape pin
 *
 * ⇒ The ruling this census was filed for HAPPENED, and it went the declare way.
 * `ObjectGridDataTableSchemaHolds` below is therefore redundant rather than
 * load-bearing — the position `headerIcon` reached at objectui#6615 — and
 * removing it is the same separate, MEASURED step objectui#6424 took there. Its
 * docblock carries what #7196 measured toward that.
 *
 * ### What the two entries used to say, and what is true instead
 *
 *   - `renderCellEditor` — said HELD, read "via its own `(schema as any)`
 *     cast", and called the `packages/types` ruling still open. All three are
 *     over: the key is declared, the cast went with the declaration
 *     (`data-table.tsx` reads `schema.renderCellEditor` directly; the line where
 *     the cast stood still spells it, as a quotation inside its own
 *     correction), and the ruling landed. BEHAVIOUR is unchanged and always
 *     was — a returned widget takes the cell, `null` falls through to the
 *     built-in text / number / date inputs.
 *   - `cellClassName` — said HELD, and described the key as folded "into every
 *     body cell's `className`". The hold is over (declared by the same #6882);
 *     the DESCRIPTION was wrong from the day it was written, which is the more
 *     useful half of this correction. Measured: `data-table.tsx` folds the
 *     SCHEMA-level key at exactly three sites and every one is a UTILITY cell —
 *     the selection checkbox, the row-number cell, the row-actions cell. It
 *     never reaches a data cell; a data cell folds `col.cellClassName`, the
 *     per-column twin declared on `TableColumn`. The two class slots style
 *     DISJOINT cells and never combine on one. So what breaks when the schema
 *     key is absent is NOT "density stops reaching cells": data cells keep
 *     their density, because `applyDensity` below puts the same class on every
 *     column. What breaks is the checkbox / row-number / row-actions cells
 *     falling out of height alignment with the data beside them, which is why
 *     this grid sets BOTH slots. #6882's declaration is where the authoritative
 *     version of this now lives; this is the local copy agreeing with it.
 *     ⭐ GUARDED SINCE objectui#6921: the cell set is MEASURED in the rendered
 *     DOM by `packages/components/src/renderers/complex/__tests__/`
 *     `data-table-cellClassName-population-6921.test.tsx` — the fence (a data
 *     cell does NOT fold this key) and the non-regression (the three utility
 *     cells DO) — and this entry's wording is pinned against that measurement
 *     by `cellClassNameCensusProse-6921.test.ts` beside the slot suite. The
 *     false sentence was copied forward for three days before anyone measured
 *     it; a re-wording here that drops a cell name or revives the hold goes red.
 *
 * ⛔ The old closing note ("do not fix either hold by declaring the key on
 * `DataTableSchema` as a rider — that package is published surface with its own
 * review floor") governs nothing now. It was asking for the ruling to be taken
 * deliberately at that package's floor, and that is exactly how #6882 took it.

 * `data-table.tsx`, not what this file happens to pass.
 *
 * ⚠️ "Undeclared by `DataTableSchema`" was this type's ENTRY CONDITION, and —
 * exactly as `ObjectGridColumnHolds` warns about its own — it is a claim about
 * ANOTHER package that can stop being true with nothing going red here. It
 * stopped being true on 2026-08-30: objectui#6882 declared BOTH members. As of
 * objectui#7196 this type holds nothing; every member is redundant with
 * `DeclaredDataTableSchema`.
 *
 * ⛔ Kept rather than deleted, because deleting a member of an EXPORTED type is
 * a change of a different kind and gets its own card — the order objectui#6615
 * → #6424 took for `headerIcon`. What #7196 measured, so that card can start
 * from a reading instead of a guess:
 *
 *   - each member's shape is `Equal` (not merely assignable) to the upstream
 *     declared member, so removing it cannot narrow or widen the seam;
 *   - the seam's `cellClassName` is already reduced (`string & string` is
 *     `string`), while its `renderCellEditor` resolves to the SAME signature
 *     intersected with itself. That is inert — mutually assignable with the
 *     declared member, measured in both directions — but it is the one visible
 *     trace the redundant hold leaves, and it is what the exact-shape pin in
 *     `packages/types` would report if pointed at the seam type;
 *   - unlike `ObjectGridColumnHolds.pinned`, neither member is its own ONLY
 *     declaration on the emitted type, so deleting them deletes nothing from
 *     it. That is precisely the ⛔ contrast `ObjectGridColumnHolds` spells out,
 *     and this type is now on the other side of it.
 *
 * ⭐ GUARDED SINCE objectui#7201 — this is the one paragraph that changed.
 * Until then nothing above was mechanically checked, which is how it went stale
 * unseen: `dataTableSchemaSlot-6459.test.ts` pinned only that the seam ACCEPTS
 * both keys, an assertion that stays green whether they are held HERE or
 * declared THERE. That suite now also carries the column-level twin's shape
 * (`columnHoldsExpiry-6424.test.ts`, which asserts `TableColumn` does NOT
 * declare `pinned`), transplanted: a compile-time verdict per member of this
 * type, recording whether `DataTableSchema` declares that key. Both members are
 * pinned DECLARED today, so a revert upstream reddens; and the key set itself is
 * pinned, so a member added or removed here reddens too. ⚠️ The transplant is
 * NOT literal in one respect, deliberately: the probe reads
 * `DeclaredDataTableSchema`, not `DataTableSchema`, because the index signature
 * stripped above makes the raw type answer "declared" to EVERY key — measured,
 * and pinned in that suite as its own control.
 *
 * ⇒ Anything in this census that a reader would otherwise have to re-measure by
 * hand is still prose; what is mechanical is the ENTRY CONDITION of the two
 * holds below. ⛔ Do not read the gate as covering the rest of the census — the
 * 46-key derivation is still hand-maintained, and whether this repo wants a
 * derivation gate over it is the question objectui#7201 left for a ruling.

          //    gate at all — and it is the case that expands the most.

    //   - `objectSchema` still `null` ⇒ this path keeps it. ⚠️ Gating on
    //     `objectName` ALONE is the trap: the schema arrives from an async
    //     fetch, so `objectSchema` is null on first paint and the grid would

  // The grouped path is the control that identified `width` as the right fix

   *
   *  - RELATIONAL (`lookup` / `master_detail` / `user` / `tree`): the column

   *    that no relation join is coming — so the column of names would come back
   *    in an order with no relation to the names.
   *  - UNMATERIALIZED (`formula`): no driver materialises a column for it, so
   *    there is nothing to order by at all. That sort never worked; until
   *    objectstack#6994 the platform did not say so (a `200` whose rows carried

   *    wire: a header offering a sort the platform cannot perform.
   *
   * The ListView toolbar's sort picker withholds both for exactly these
   * reasons; a clickable header would have been the same illusion through a
   * different control.
   *
   * Only under manual sorting. A client-side sort keys off the value the cell
   * renders (`getSortValue`, #3096) — the resolved label for a relational
   * column, the server-hydrated result for a formula one — which is honest, so

  //     `plugin-list`'s own footer draws exactly this inference when no total
  //     is known (`items.length >= effectivePageSize`), and it can only ever
  //     say "may": a result set that exactly fills the window trips it too.
