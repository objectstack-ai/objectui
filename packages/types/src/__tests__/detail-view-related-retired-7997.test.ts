 * objectui#7997 — `DetailViewSchema.related` is RETIRED on BOTH faces, as a
 * NAMED REFUSAL rather than a deletion.
 *
 * ## The ruling, and what carried it
 *
 * Maintainer, 2026-09-10, quoted verbatim and untranslated because a paraphrase
 * is a different ruling:
 *
 * > 关掉详情页那个入口（推荐）
 *
 * ("close that entry point on the detail page (recommended)".) The axis that
 * carried it was measured ZERO PULL: no application code authored the member,
 * both internal producers of a `detail-view` node (`RecordDetailDrawer`,
 * `renderers/record-details.tsx`) synthesize it without `related`, and the only
 * in-tree authorings carrying real columns were two documents, both rewritten
 * by the same change.
 *
 * ⚠️ An argument that did NOT carry it, recorded so it is not repeated: the
 * protocol's `related: 'tabs'` alias. That alias lives in
 * `RecordPageSchema.slots` (`page.zod.ts`), a SLOT-NAME map whose vocabulary is
 * header | actions | alerts | highlights | details | tabs | discussion. It says
 * "if you name a SLOT `related`, we mean the `tabs` slot" — it matched the
 * WORD, and says nothing about an array of related-list configs, which the
 * protocol never had.
 *
 * ## Why a refusal and not a deletion — the mechanism, not a preference
 *
 * `BaseSchema` closes with an any-valued index signature and `BaseSchemaCore`
 * ends `.passthrough()`. A DROPPED member key is therefore KEPT, not refused:
 * deleting the declaration would have left the silent accept exactly as it was
 * and thrown the diagnostic away with it (the mechanism objectui#7963
 * measured). Declared-and-unwritable is what makes the refusal loud —
 * `?: never` on the TypeScript face, `retirementTombstone()` on the mirror.
 *
 * ⭐ The block that proves this is not a stylistic claim is (c) below: it
 * authors an UNDECLARED sibling key through the very same parse and shows it
 * surviving. Without that row, "a bare delete would not have refused it" is an
 * assertion; with it, it is a reading taken on this schema.
 *
 * ## Which program checks this file
 *
 * `packages/types`' `type-check` runs THREE programs; this file is in the third
 * (`tsconfig.test.json` — `tsc --noEmit` builds `tsconfig.json`, which excludes
 * `__tests__/` by directory). The subject is imported as a sibling SOURCE
 * module, so that program reads the declaration directly with no `dist`
 * staleness in between.
 *
 * ## What did NOT retire
 *
 * The capability. `record:related_list` is the protocol-governed entry
 * (`@objectstack/spec` `RecordRelatedListProps`, `columns: z.array(z.string())`),
 * its objectui mirror `RecordRelatedListComponentProps` is unchanged, and both
 * entries always rendered through the same `RelatedList` component. Block (d)
 * pins that survivor, because a retirement pin that only proves absence is
 * equally green against a tree where the whole feature was deleted.
