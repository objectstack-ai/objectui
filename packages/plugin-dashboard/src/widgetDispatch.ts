 * Widget-type → dispatch family, shared by every dashboard surface.
 *
 * Three surfaces used to restate this knowledge independently and disagree:
 * `DatasetWidget` covered all 19 `ChartTypeSchema` values, `DashboardRenderer`
 * covered 15, and `DashboardGridLayout` 8. A type the surface didn't name fell
 * through to `{ ...widget }`, whose `type` no component registers — so
 * `SchemaRenderer` rendered a red `role="alert"` panel dumping the widget JSON
 * (#2943).
 *
 * The single-value families were the sharpest case: `DashboardRenderer` already
 * had `METRIC_LIKE_TYPES = ['gauge','solid-gauge','kpi','bullet']` with a
 * docstring saying they "render as a metric card rather than a chart" — and
 * consulted it only to pick a grid span. The tile was sized correctly and the
 * widget was never routed.
