/**
 * ObjectUI — `quickAdd` on the `ObjectKanbanRenderer` tag is DIAGNOSED,
 * and diagnosed truthfully (objectui#8285, ruling of 2026-09-08, batch #91)
 *
 * The mechanism, over a hand-built manifest that mirrors the real
 * registrations. Its sibling
 * `packages/plugin-kanban/src/__tests__/quickAddIsDiagnosedNotDropped-8285.test.ts`
 * asks the same question of the LIVE registry — the verdict a real author gets
 * — and re-derives the host-tag set from the registration calls. Split the same
 * way objectui#5709 split its own pair, for the same reason: a fixture proves
 * the RULE, a live registry proves the READING.
 *
 * ## What is red here before the change, and what is not
 *
 * ⚠️ Only the rows that assert `inert-quick-add` are red before this change.
 * `quickAdd` is undeclared on both registrations (objectui#8201 escalated it
 * rather than declaring it), so the tier ALREADY reported it — as
 * `unknown-prop`, a message that is false against the contract the spec still
 * publishes. The change replaces a wrong reading; it does not add a first one.
 *
 * The remaining rows are green in BOTH worlds by construction, and each is
 * kept because it names a WRONG FIX that would otherwise pass:
 *
 *   - the unknown-prop control — a fix that suppressed the generic walk for
 *     this block rather than for this one key;
 *   - the two RETIRED kanban-ish tags (`kanban`, `kanban-ui`) — a fix scoped
 *     to "a kanban-ish tag" rather than to the one registration that serves
 *     `ObjectKanbanRenderer`. Both left the registry with objectui#8802 /
 *     objectui#8257, so neither is a host any more; they stay declared in the
 *     hand-built manifest below precisely so this row can still discriminate;
 *   - `quickAdd: false` — a fix keyed on the KEY's presence rather than on the
 *     author asking for the control, which would warn about a value that got
 *     exactly what it asked for;
 *   - the braced marker — a fix that reads the parser's opaque `$expr` object
 *     as "truthy, therefore the author asked for it";
 *   - `ok` staying true — an escalation to `error`, which the objectui#5709
 *     ruling ("no new red gates") and objectui#6614 Q2 both put elsewhere.
