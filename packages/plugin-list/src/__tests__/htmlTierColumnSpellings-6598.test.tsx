 *
 * objectui#6598 — the reporter's EIGHT `columns` spellings, end to end on a
 * `kind:'html'` page, pinned as a matrix.
 *
 * ## What was reported, and what this file is for
 *
 * The production report (objectstack#12649, hotcrm, promo-video recon) tried
 * eight ways of getting columns onto a `<list-view>` in an html-kind page and
 * got ONE picture from all eight: the row count ("23 records"), the
 * filter/group/sort toolbar, and **no data columns at all — only the index
 * column**, with zero diagnostics anywhere. That uniformity is what made the
 * card so hard to anchor: it read as a single bug, and it was not one. It was
 * three unrelated mechanisms whose failure modes happened to look identical
 * from the page:
 *
 *   - a GRAMMAR limit — `interpretBrace` materialized strict JSON only, so the
 *     single-quoted array every JSX author writes became an inert `{ $expr }`
 *     marker nothing downstream evaluates (fixed by objectui#6614 / PR #6669);
 *   - a HANDOFF lie — `ListView` spelled "the author declared nothing" as
 *     `fields: []`, and an empty array is truthy, so `ObjectGrid` pinned its
 *     projection at zero and neither default-columns derivation could run
 *     (fixed by objectui#6598's first half, PR #6679);
 *   - two spellings that were never the contract at all (`viewName` / `view`),
 *     plus two that fail loudly: one a page-fatal compile error, and one the
 *     block answers with its "no object named" hint (a compile error too until
 *     objectui#11605 stopped `list-view` requiring `objectName`).
 *
 * Sibling files pin the mechanisms one at a time:
 * `literal-subset-6614.test.ts` and `inert-expression-6598.test.ts` in
 * `@object-ui/sdui-parser` own the grammar and its diagnostic;
 * `ListView.unauthoredColumnProjection-6598.test.tsx` owns the handoff against
 * a stub grid; `htmlTierListViewDefaultColumns-6598.test.tsx` takes the
 * unauthored case end to end.
 *
 * ⚠️ None of them pins THE CARD'S OWN CLAIM, which is a statement about all
 * eight spellings at once: *whatever* an author writes for `columns` on this
 * tier, the page must never again land in the reported state. That claim can
 * only be checked as a matrix, and only through the real live registration —
 * so this file runs the real page renderer, the real html-tier compile against
 * the real registry manifest, the real `list-view` registration and the real
 * `object-grid`, once per spelling.
 *
 * ## The invariant, and why it is shaped this way
 *
 * The reported failure had two halves: the page showed no data columns, AND it
 * said nothing about why. So the invariant every spelling must satisfy is a
 * disjunction — each form either
 *
 *   (a) renders a table with at least one DATA column, or
 *   (b) fails LOUDLY, with the compile-error block on screen, or with the
 *       block's own "no object named" hint naming the key it is missing.
 *
 * What no form may do is what all eight did when the card was filed: render a
 * populated table whose only header is the index column. A spelling moving
 * between (a) and (b) is a design decision someone can argue about; a spelling
 * falling out of both is this card regressing.
 *
 * Registered in `heavyDomTests` for the setup's `@object-ui/plugin-grid`
 * side-effect registration — the same route the sibling end-to-end file takes.
