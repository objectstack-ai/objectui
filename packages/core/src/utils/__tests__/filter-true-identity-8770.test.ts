/**
 * The TRUE-identity combinators reach the wire as "no constraint" —
 * objectui#8770.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `lowerLogicalGroup` answers `undefined` for a group that reduces to the TRUE
 * identity, and that is correct and deliberate (see its docblock: a childless
 * `['and']` is `isFilterAST` FALSE, which reads as no filter at all). But when
 * such a group was the ONLY thing in the filter, that `undefined` fell through
 * to `convertFiltersToAST`'s general tail — `if (conditions.length === 0)
 * return filter` — and the CALLER'S ORIGINAL OBJECT came back. So the group did
 * not disappear at that level after all; it reappeared one level up, in the `$`
 * dialect, in a slot the AST is expected to occupy.
 *
 * Three of the four identities went out that way and one did not, which is what
 * made this an internal inconsistency rather than an open question: the same
 * function already lowered `{ $or: [] }` correctly.
 *
 * ## Why the assertions are shaped the way they are
 *
 * Two halves, because either alone passes on something worse than the bug:
 *
 *   - a SHAPE assertion (`toBeUndefined`) alone passes on a converter that has
 *     stopped emitting anything at all;
 *   - a ROW-SET assertion alone passes on a filter that never ran — `$filter:
 *     undefined` returns EVERY row, and so does a correct TRUE identity, so the
 *     row set cannot tell "honoured" from "dropped".
 *
 * So the shape half is asserted against the spec's own door (`isFilterAST`)
 * rather than against a literal, the row-set half names exact ids, and the
 * FALSE identity `{ $or: [] }` is carried through every section as a control:
 * it must keep answering NO rows. A change that flattened the identities into
 * one arm would take the control with it.
 *
 * `FILTER_LOGIC_ROWS` (`@objectstack/spec/data`) is the published cross-backend
 * fixture the identity ruling (objectstack#5322, merged objectstack#5365) is
 * held to, so the row sets here are the platform's own and not a local
 * restatement of them.
