/**
 * objectui#9727 -- the REBUILT polarity instrument.
 *
 * The card this file serves does not ask for 53 changeset repairs. It asks for
 * an instrument, because the numbers it carries are TRANSCRIBED: the script that
 * produced them was cleaned up with its author's worktree, so nothing on the
 * card is re-derivable, and acting on a candidate table nobody has run is how a
 * second generation of false records gets made.
 *
 * ⭐ And the transcribed instrument had a PROVEN FALSE NEGATIVE: it missed THE
 * SITE THAT MOTIVATED THE CARD, because that claim's object is the pronoun
 * `them`, resolved across a sentence boundary. An instrument blind to the shape
 * that produced it is not a census, and its output was a FLOOR.
 *
 * What this file pins, in the order the instrument can go wrong:
 *
 *  1. THE CLOSED BLINDNESS. The motivating site, by its PRE-REPAIR text, is
 *     FOUND -- and found with exactly the keys objectui#9713 adjudicated. This
 *     is the pin that goes red if the blindness returns.
 *  2. QUOTATION. The same sentence, in the quoted position objectui#9713's
 *     repair actually put it in, is reported and NEVER flagged. Without this
 *     the instrument re-flags every site this lane has already repaired.
 *  3. WHITESPACE. A claim that wraps at eighty columns -- where this corpus
 *     wraps -- reads as one sentence. A line-anchored probe reads nothing.
 *  4. (interface, name). A key of a REFERENCED schema is not a member of the
 *     referrer, and an inherited index signature is not membership either.
 *  5. TENSE. A bare past-tense sentence is historical, cannot rot, and is out.
 *  6. CONTROLS. A lit control and an absent control, and -- the leg that makes
 *     the zeros mean anything -- a FAILED control voids the run.
 *  7. IT DOES NOT ANSWER ABOUT ITSELF. The corpus is `.changeset/` and nothing
 *     else, so the script cannot match its own docstring or these fixtures.
 *  8. POLARITY IS A CLAUSE PROPERTY (objectui#9754). A negator that belongs to
 *     another clause does not invert the verdict on a key this sentence
 *     asserts -- and, the other leg, a negator that DOES scope the declaration
 *     verb still does. Without the second leg the repair would have traded
 *     false positives for false negatives, which is the failure this whole
 *     family of cards is about.
 *  9. THE WINDOW IS THE DECLARATION CLAUSE (objectui#9754). A key predicated
 *     of something OTHER than the schema the sentence names is no longer paired
 *     with it -- and the two legs that keep that from being blindness: a key the
 *     clause really does predicate of the named schema is still flagged, and the
 *     relative clause, which has no subject of its own, still reaches its
 *     antecedent.
 * 10. A KEY IS A NAME, AND THE SPAN IS THAT NAME (objectui#9766). A call, a
 *     heritage clause, a statement and an operator use are code, not names; and
 *     a word of the language the faces are written in is a key only where the
 *     tree declares a member by that name. Both of that rule's escape legs are
 *     pinned, because each one alone is a way of buying precision with
 *     blindness: refuse `type` by its spelling and the most-declared key in the
 *     tree is gone, refuse every name the tree does not declare and the ROTTED
 *     claim -- the instrument's entire purpose -- is gone with it.
 *
 * Every pin except 6 and 7 runs against FIXTURES, deliberately. The live
 * `packages/types/src` moves whenever a card declares a member -- which is the
 * event the census exists to notice -- so a pin read from it would go red for
 * the tree's reasons rather than the instrument's.

   * `⛔ unrepaired` about a false-positive SOURCE: an entry may carry a table
   * whose first column is a reading it is RETIRING and whose later columns are
   * what falsified it. Quotation cannot reach that reading -- it is not quoted,
   * it is TABULATED -- so it stood in ASSERTION position with its own correction
   * one cell to the right, unread.
   *
   * ⭐ Measuring it first moved the repair. The entry said the cells of one ROW
   * were joined into one sentence and called that join deliberate; the code
   * doing the joining carried the OPPOSITE intent in its own comment, and
   * achieved neither. `. ` cuts only before a character that is not lower-case,
   * and a row's last cell got no terminator at all -- so an entire table,
   * header and delimiter row included, collapsed into ONE sentence, and every
   * key in it was offered to every schema named anywhere in it. That is
   * objectui#9754's cartesian window rebuilt one level up.
   *
   * `12-superseded-readings-table.md` carries the shape and the three ways the
   * repair could have been bought with blindness, so one run reads them all.
   * The readings this pin is judged against, taken on the fixture corpus with
   * the instrument as it stood at the parent commit and again after:
   *
   *   BEFORE  ObjectKanbanSchema.swimlaneWidth   FLAG  (retired reading)
   *           SpinnerSchema.size                 FLAG  (retired reading)

   *           ObjectKanbanSchema.cards           FLAG  (cross-ROW pairing)
   *           LaneSchema.laneWidth               FLAG  (an ordinary table asserts)
   *           ObjectKanbanSchema.dragHandle      --    (missed: the collapse hid it)
