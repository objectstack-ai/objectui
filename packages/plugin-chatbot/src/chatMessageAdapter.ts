/**
 * The `@object-ui/types` <-> `@object-ui/plugin-chatbot` chat-message seam
 * (objectui#4399).
 *
 * Two `ChatMessage` types meet in `renderer.tsx`, both on purpose:
 *
 *   - `@object-ui/types`' `ChatMessage` is the **authoring** contract — the
 *     JSON an SDUI schema declares (`ChatMessageSchema` in
 *     `packages/types/src/zod/complex.zod.ts`), so it is deliberately wider:
 *     a `'tool'` role and a `Date` timestamp are authorable.
 *   - `./ChatbotEnhanced`'s `ChatMessage` is the **runtime** contract — what
 *     the React components actually render, so it is deliberately narrower
 *     (three roles, string timestamps) and carries render-only keys the
 *     authoring surface has no business declaring (`buildProgress`, `charts`).
 *
 * Until this module they met as three `messages as any` casts, which erased
 * ALL of the drift rather than the parts that are intentional: a new authored
 * role or a newly required runtime key would have kept compiling and surfaced
 * as rendering behaviour instead of a type error. This module is that seam,
 * written down — one conversion, each narrowing decision named and tested.
 *
 * ## Narrowing decisions
 *
 * | key                    | authoring                                | runtime                     | decision |
 * |------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
 * | `role`                 | `'user'\|'assistant'\|'system'\|'tool'`  | `'user'\|'assistant'\|'system'` | `'tool'` renders as an **assistant** bubble — see {@link toRuntimeRole} |
 * | `timestamp`            | `string \| Date`                         | `string`                    | `Date` -> ISO 8601 — see {@link toRuntimeTimestamp} |
 * | `toolInvocations[].state` | v6 states **minus** the three approval states, **+ legacy** `'partial-call'\|'call'\|'result'` | v6 states only | legacy -> v6, per the authoring type's own doc comment — see {@link toRuntimeToolState}. The approval states are runtime-only (objectui#10018): the seam's INPUT admits them for API-mode values — see {@link SeamToolInvocation} |
 * | `metadata`             | `any`                                    | *not declared*              | passed through untouched (see "Pass-through" below) |
 * | everything else        | same shape on both sides                 | —                           | passed through untouched |
 *
 * ## Pass-through — why this is a conversion and not a reconstruction
 *
 * The adapter narrows the drifting fields **by name** and spreads the rest. It
 * deliberately does NOT rebuild the message field-by-field, because the values
 * arriving here are not always plain authored ones: in API mode they are
 * RUNTIME messages carrying `buildProgress`, `blueprintProgress`, `charts` and
 * tool invocations bearing the HITL / draft-review extensions. A field-by-field
 * rebuild would silently drop the approval cards, the "Review N changes"
 * affordance and the build panel.
 *
 * What changed in objectui#4424: those keys are no longer preserved *by faith*.
 * The hook used to declare its output as the authoring type and reach the
 * runtime values through `uiMessagesToChatMessages(...) as OuiChatMessage[]`,
 * so this module could only ever have SPREAD keys it could not see. The hook
 * now declares {@link ObjectChatMessage} — the truth about both of its modes —
 * and this seam accepts {@link SeamChatMessage}, which names the runtime-only
 * keys as optional members. The spread therefore carries them as DECLARED
 * properties: `tsc` can see what survives, and the pass-through tests type
 * their API-mode fixture directly instead of casting it into place.
 *
 * The compile-time value of the seam is unaffected by that: a new authored
 * `role` makes {@link toRuntimeRole} unassignable, and a newly REQUIRED runtime
 * key makes {@link authoredToRuntimeMessage}'s return type red. Both are the
 * type error the cast used to swallow.
 *
 * ## Why the seam's INPUT is wider than the hook's OUTPUT
 *
 * {@link SeamChatMessage} keeps authoring's `timestamp?: string | Date`, while
 * {@link ObjectChatMessage} narrows it to `string`. That is not an oversight:
 * both hook modes absorb the `Date` before they emit (via
 * {@link toRuntimeTimestamp}), but this module is exported from the barrel for
 * hosts holding raw authored messages — the `Date` still has to die somewhere,
 * and this is the somewhere. `AuthoredChatMessage` remains assignable to
 * `SeamChatMessage`, so every existing caller is untouched.

 * (and folds `'system'` in as well). This one answers a different question —
 * which runtime role an authored `'tool'` message IS. `'system'` keeps its own
