 *
 * `object-view` — the HOST-COMPOSITION SURFACE ledger.
 *
 * TWO records live here, in the same shape and for the same reason: a
 * maintainer ruled that something this component reads or renders stays HOST
 * surface rather than becoming authored surface, and a census has to be able
 * to read that ruling somewhere other than a closed issue.
 *
 *   1. objectui#5097 — the 27 `renderListView` keys stay undeclared, and stay
 *      read. Sections 1-3 below.
 *   2. objectui#5321 — the `tree` and `chart` view-type branches stay
 *      unauthored, and stay reachable from a host `views` prop. Section 4.
 *
 * =========================================================================
 * RECORD 1 — the 27 keys ruled HOST-COMPOSITION SURFACE (objectui#5097)
 * =========================================================================
 *
 * ## The card, and the ruling
 *
 * objectui#5097 measured 31 distinct keys that `ObjectView`'s `renderListView`
 * delegation branch reads off the object-view node through `(schema as any).K`
 * and forwards to the host's list renderer. Four are declared members of
 * `ObjectViewSchema`; 27 are not.
 *
 * The maintainer ruled on 2026-08-18 (verbatim 「同意」) that the 27 are HOST
 * surface, exempted with reasons — not authored surface — on a MEASURED
 * REACHABILITY basis: the branch runs only when a host passes `renderListView`,
 * and the registered renderer never does, so the schema-registration path
 * documented to authors cannot reach these keys at all. Declaring them would
 * promise authors a surface that does nothing on their path.
 *
 * This file is where that word "deliberate" is said to the tooling, so the next
 * census re-files the card only if something really changed.
 *
 * ## Why this pins the PROPERTY, not the enumeration
 *
 * The sibling exemption for `object-grid` (objectui#5091, PR #5241) could
 * afford four assertions per key: there were three keys. Twenty-seven of them
 * written out four times over would be noise nobody re-reads, and noise is how
 * a stale list survives. So the three things that actually carry the ruling are
 * pinned as properties instead:
 *
 *   1. THE SET IS WHAT THE DOC SAYS IT IS. The key set is re-derived from the
 *      `#region` fence in `ObjectView.tsx` at test time and compared with
 *      `OBJECT_VIEW_HOST_COMPOSITION_KEYS`, so adding or removing a read
 *      without touching the list fails BY NAME. A hand-copied list in a test
 *      would only ever agree with itself.
 *   2. THE RULING'S BASIS HOLDS. The registered renderer passes no
 *      `renderListView`, so the branch is unreachable from the authored path.
 *      If a future change starts supplying it, 27 keys are silently promoted to
 *      the authored path — that must fail loudly, here, rather than be found by
 *      the next census.
 *   3. THE READS STILL HAPPEN. Deleting a read is the one move that silently
 *      blanks a stored app-shell document, and it is exactly what a reader of
 *      "not authored surface" is most likely to think is the tidy finish.
 *
 * ## What is NOT owed here, and why
 *
 * PR #5241's assertions 2 and 3 — "the spec rejects the key by name", "the real
 * validator answers `unknown-prop`" — do not transfer, because
 * `@objectstack/spec` carries no `object-view` entry in `ComponentPropsMap` at
 * all. That absence is itself pinned below: it is what makes the repo-wide
 * `registry-inputs-spec-parity` gate (which derives its expectations FROM
 * `ComponentPropsMap`) inapplicable to this node in either direction, so the
 * exemption owes that gate nothing. If the spec ever starts modelling
 * `object-view`, this exemption needs re-reading, and the pin says so.

// can is the `views` PROP, typed `ViewType`, which carries both. So those two

// ADR-0021 dataset-bound chart shape included — are reachable only when a HOST

//     cannot be pinned at runtime: types are erased before vitest runs, so a
//     force-cast `defaultViewType: 'tree'` WOULD reach the branch, and a
//     runtime test claiming otherwise could only pass by testing something
//     else.
//   - "a host still can" is a RUNTIME claim, and it is the basis the ruling
//     rests on, so it is measured rather than asserted in prose:
//     `ObjectView.hostOnlyViewTypes.test.tsx` drives both branches through a
//     `views` prop.
