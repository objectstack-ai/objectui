/**
 * check-eager-locale-catalogues -- exactly ONE locale catalogue may be in the
 * console's EAGER closure, and it must be the resident one (objectui#7479).
 *
 *   pnpm check:eager-locale-catalogues     # after a full console build
 *
 * ## What this weighs, and why the budget gate cannot
 *
 * `scripts/check-eager-closure-budget.mjs` weighs BYTES. That is the right
 * instrument for growth and the wrong one for this: the ten catalogues could
 * come back into the eager closure one at a time, each arrival small enough to
 * fit inside a ceiling's headroom, and every run would be green until the last
 * one. It could also be defeated in the opposite direction -- objectui#7399
 * named that explicitly and refused it -- by routing the same bytes into a
 * chunk with a roomier ceiling, which changes WHERE the browser fetches them
 * from and not WHETHER it fetches them.
 *
 * So this gate weighs COMPOSITION: which catalogues a page load pulls, not what
 * they cost. The two halves are complementary and neither substitutes for the
 * other.
 *
 * ## The regression it exists to catch
 *
 * `packages/i18n/src/index.ts` used to re-export all ten catalogues, and
 * `locales/index.ts`'s `builtInLocales` named every one of them in a single
 * object literal. Both spellings make all ten statically reachable from any
 * import of the package, and nothing can tree-shake an object literal's
 * members. Measured on the console: ~445 KB gzipped of translation data
 * fetched before first paint, of which a viewer reads one catalogue's worth.
 *
 * ⛔ Restoring either spelling is a ONE-LINE regression that no byte budget
 * reports as one, because the bytes land in a chunk that already has a ceiling
 * sized to hold them. `packages/i18n/src/__tests__/entry-locale-shape-7479.test.ts`
 * fails on the SOURCE shape so the cause is legible without a build; this file
 * fails on the BUILT bundle so a new route to the same outcome -- a chunk group
 * that merges the ten back together, a consumer that imports the barrel on a
 * page-load path, a bundler upgrade that stops honouring `import()` boundaries
 * -- is caught even when every source file still reads correctly.
 *
 * ## Why `en` is the one that may be eager
 *
 * It is `fallbackLng`, it is the dictionary `@object-ui/app-shell`'s splash
 * renders from before i18n is usable, and it is what a synchronous
 * `createI18n()` call has to be able to answer with. The argument in full is in
 * `packages/i18n/src/locales/registry.ts`. This gate does not re-argue it; it
 * pins it, and {@link ACTIVE_CATALOGUE} is the single place the choice is
 * written down on this side.
 *
 * ## Exit codes (the same three meanings as the budget gate)
 *
 *   0  every non-resident catalogue is lazy -- a verdict about the bundle
 *   1  at least one is eager -- a verdict about the bundle
 *   2  no trustworthy verdict -- a verdict about the GAUGE
 *
 * ⛔ 2 is not a softer 1. A gate that cannot run is not a gate that passed:
 * without `apps/console/dist/` this checker has nothing to read, and a
 * "no catalogues are eager" printed over an absent build is the most confident
 * wrong answer available. Two counter-probes below turn each way that could
 * happen into a 2.
