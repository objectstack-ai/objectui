/**
 * objectui#8761 — five catalog entries whose whole subject is "a label stacked
 * above its control" authored their `flex` root as `direction: "column"`.
 *
 * `column` is the CSS spelling, and it is not in the vocabulary either face
 * declares: `FlexSchema.direction` is `row | col | row-reverse | col-reverse`,
 * and the `flex` renderer maps only `col` / `col-reverse` to a column class.
 * So the same key was wrong twice over, and the two faces agreed about it:
 *
 *   - the validator refused every one of the five (`invalid_value` at
 *     `direction`, the ONLY issue on each document);
 *   - the renderer added no direction class at all, so each root kept the
 *     flexbox default and drew the label BESIDE its control — on the four
 *     component docs pages that embed these entries (label, date-picker,
 *     input-otp, radio-group), whose Code tab also taught the refused value.
 *
 * The repair is the fixtures, not the vocabulary (triage ruling on the card:
 * the accept set is not widened to admit `column`). `catalog-gallery-render`
 * could not see any of this: `flex` is registered, so the entries rendered —
 * just wrongly — and nothing compared the picture with the fixture's intent.
 *
 * ## What each block pins, and why both halves are needed
 *
 * The parse block asks for a FULL `safeValidateSchema` green, not the absence
 * of one issue code: the defect was a refused VALUE on a declared key, and a
 * value rule is judged by the whole parse. The render block reads the class
 * the renderer actually emitted: a fixture can parse and still not draw a
 * column (`row` is a legal value too), and the column is what these entries
 * exist to show.
 *
 * ⛔ Scope: these five entries only — every `"direction": "column"` the tree
 * carried when the card was worked. This is deliberately not a catalog-wide
 * walker, and it pins nothing about how the renderer treats an UNDECLARED
 * direction value; that question is outside this card.
