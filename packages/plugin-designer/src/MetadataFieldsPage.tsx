 * Why we save the *parent object* instead of `/meta/field/:name`:
 *   In the ObjectStack data protocol, fields live INSIDE an object's
 *   `fields: Record<string, FieldSchema>` map — there is no per-field
 *   document in the canonical Zod source. The metadata type registry
 *   does expose `type: 'field'` for cases where a field is shipped as
 *   a stand-alone artifact (third-party extension), but the normal
 *   path used by the Setup app is to mutate the parent object so the
 *   round-trip stays consistent with the artifact format the CLI dump
 *   produces (`*.object.ts`).
 *
 * The container preserves any object-schema attribute it doesn't
 * know about (indexes, hooks, permissions, lifecycle, …) by deep
 * cloning the loaded raw payload and only swapping in the new

/**
 * Field keys the ObjectStack spec REJECTS by name, dropped out of

 *
 * Derived from the tombstone registry (`RETIRED_FIELD_KEY_TOMBSTONES` in
 * `@object-ui/types`, objectui#6527) — this carry-over is the registry's
 * `metadataFieldsPageCarryOver` site. The registry names each retired key, the
 * card that retired it, and which sites strip it; the per-key evidence lives
 * there. What stays HERE is what is specific to THIS writer's history:
 *
 * Each key is one this page's own era wrote (`indexed` via the Advanced
 * section of {@link FieldDesigner}, objectui#4644; `referenceTo` via
 * `fromDesignerField`'s old emit line, objectui#6041; `isSystem` as a declared
 * `ServerFieldSchema` member served back to us, objectui#6044; `formula` via
 * the retired formula textarea, objectui#6043), and `fromDesignerField`
 * spreads `prev` verbatim to preserve unknown keys — so a stored object from
 * that era would carry the key straight back out to
 * `PUT /api/v1/meta/object/:name` as a hard 422 (`INVALID_METADATA`) that
 * blocks every later save, with no control left on screen to clear it.
 * Stripping the carried-over keys is what makes an edit-and-save round-trip of
 * such an object come out parseable; it is keyed to the tombstones, so every
 * other unknown key the designer does not render still survives.
 *
 * Two of the four cost nothing: `fromDesignerField` re-emits the lookup target
 * under the spec spelling `reference` on the very next line, and the system
 * flag is read back from the spec spelling `system` (never re-emitted — the
 * strip IS the whole write half of objectui#6044). `formula` is the one entry
 * whose strip DROPS a value, and that is objectui#6043's deliberate trade: the
 * server refuses to store it, a blind rename to `expression` would launder
 * non-CEL text into a formula that parses green and evaluates to null, and
 * with the textarea gone stripping is the only way out of the 422. The
 * migration surface for the VALUE is metadata-admin's `ObjectFieldInspector`
 * (ruled again on objectui#6526, option B), which is why the READ door's list
 * does not include `formula` while this write door's does. `expression` itself
 * is a real `FieldSchema` key and rides through `carryOver` untouched.
 *
 * `sortOrder` is absent here on the same unmeasured premise it always had: no
 * shipped writer on this tree ever populated a field-level one (objectui#6045)
 * — see its tombstone for the one site that keeps a recorded-defensive strip.

/**
 * Refuse a relationship field whose target is missing — BEFORE the PUT.
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 made `reference` a hard requirement on `lookup`
 * and `master_detail` (a `custom` refinement at path `reference`). Against a
 * matched backend, PUTting a half-filled relationship draft returns `422
 * INVALID_METADATA` for the WHOLE object document — so the damage is not
 * confined to the incomplete field: every later save of that object fails the
 * same way until the draft is completed or removed. At 17.2.0 the requirement
 * was prose only and this page persisted such drafts freely.
 *
 * The maintainer's reconciliation for that change (objectui#7122, 2026-09-05,
 * ruled item 4) is to keep the incomplete draft in the client and never PUT it.
 * This raises inside the caller's save `try`, so the message lands in the
 * page's existing error surface — the same banner a nameless or duplicated
 * field already produces, and no new UI affordance.
 *
 * ## The `.trim()` is a DECLARED DIVERGENCE, not an accident
 *
 * The predicate is `typeof reference === 'string' && reference.trim() !== ''`,
 * which is STRICTER than the contract. Measured on the installed 17.3.0, at
 * field level and again through the whole document:
 *
 *   FieldSchema.safeParse({ type: 'lookup', label: 'L', reference: '   ' })
 *     => success = true
 *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ …, fields: { rel: { …, reference: '   ' } } })
 *     => success = true
 *
 * — the spec ACCEPTS a whitespace-only target and this page refuses it.
 * objectui being stricter than the platform is a divergence, not a neutral
 * choice, so it is STATED rather than left to be inferred from a predicate
 * (objectui#7122 contract review); undeclared, it is indistinguishable from a
 * bug and the next reader "fixes" it.
 *
 * ⭐ Kept, deliberately. A whitespace-only `reference` names no object — there
 * is no `   ` object for the record picker to query or for `$expand` to resolve
 * — so admitting it buys the author nothing and only moves the same failure to
 * a later and worse place, past the PUT and into a stored document. This guard
 * exists precisely to stop a target-less lookup being saved, and a blank target
 * is a target-less lookup that happens to parse.
 *
 * ⚠️ The spec accepting `'   '` while refusing `''` reads as an upstream gap
 * rather than deliberate latitude — filed as objectstack#16126. This page is
 * compensating for it; when it lands upstream, this section retires and the
 * behaviour stays. The sibling writer (`MetadataService.ts`) carries the same
 * declaration, for the parity reason stated above.

 * Key the designer's field list by field NAME — the shape `ObjectSchema.fields`

 * `MetadataService.toFieldsMap` (objectui#6240), deliberately down to the
 * refusal wording: the two writers are the objectui#5761 parity family, and a
 * difference between them is a defect waiting to be found twice.
 *
 * ## Why `Object.fromEntries` and not assignment into a literal
 *
 * `map['__proto__'] = def` does not create a key — it invokes the prototype
 * setter — and `__proto__` is a SPEC-LEGAL field name (`ObjectSchema.fields`'
 * key schema is `/^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$/`, which it matches). Built by assignment,
 * such a field disappeared from the serialised PUT body while the spec stood
 * ready to accept it. Measured on `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0:
 *
 *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ …, fields: { ['__proto__']: { type: 'text', label: 'P' } } })
 *     => success = true
 *
 * `Object.fromEntries` defines an own property instead. This is what makes the
 * construction load-bearing rather than stylistic.
 *
 * ## Why a missing name THROWS instead of writing `{ undefined: … }`
 *
 * `DesignerFieldDefinition.name` is declared required, but this page is handed
 * whatever the in-memory designer model holds. A nameless field keys as the
 * literal string `"undefined"` — and the spec does NOT catch that either:
 *
 *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ …, fields: { undefined: { type: 'text', label: 'N' } } })
 *     => success = true
 *
 * So it parses, it is STORED, and no reader anywhere looks for it: a silently
 * corrupt document in place of a loud refusal.
 *
 * ## Why a duplicate name throws too
 *
 * That one is the conversion's OWN hazard rather than an inherited one: the
 * designer's list can carry two fields called `amount` and a map cannot, so the
 * later entry silently swallowed the earlier. Refusing is the only reading that
 * does not lose a field the author declared.
 *
 * The caller runs this inside its save `try`, so a refusal lands in the page's
 * existing error surface. That is the one deliberate difference from the
 * sibling writer, and it is forced by the caller's shape: `onFieldsChange` is
 * fire-and-forget (`void handleFieldsChange(next)`), so throwing to it would
 * produce an unhandled rejection and show the author nothing — the same silent
 * failure this function exists to end. The property both writers do share is
 * the one that matters: it raises BEFORE the request, so a refused list issues
 * no PUT at all.
