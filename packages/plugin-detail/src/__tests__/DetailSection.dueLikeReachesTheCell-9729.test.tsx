/**
 * An authored `dueLike` on a DETAIL-VIEW FIELD reaches the cell (objectui#9729).
 *
 * ## Why this reading exists
 *
 * `views.zod.ts#DetailViewFieldSchema` states `dueLike` and the `DetailViewField`
 * twin does not — one of the two LOCAL entries in the `MirroredUndeclared`
 * ledger. The contract review that decides which published face moves needs one
 * fact the ledger cannot carry: whether anything READS the key on THIS pair's
 * authored face, because a key nothing reads is a different decision from one a
 * renderer consumes.
 *
 * ⛔ A source grep cannot answer that. `SchemaRenderer` hands a node's leftover
 * keys to the component as props, and this path adds a second hop of its own:
 * `DetailSection` spreads the authored field into the enriched bag
 * (`enrichDetailField` opens with a spread of the view field) and hands that bag
 * to the resolved cell renderer. So the question is asked here the only way it
 * can be answered — by rendering, and by watching the drawn text change.
 *
 * ## The reading, and its control
 *
 * `end_date` deliberately does NOT match the due/deadline field-NAME convention
 * that `resolveDueLike` falls back to, so the authored key is the only thing
 * that can turn the affordance on. The control leg renders BY VALUE — it asserts
 * the neutral relative wording is present, not merely that "Overdue" is absent,
 * which would also be true of a document that drew nothing.
 *
 * ⛔ This file takes no position on the remedy. It measures a read; whether the
 * key should be declared on the twin or removed from the mirror is objectui#9729.
