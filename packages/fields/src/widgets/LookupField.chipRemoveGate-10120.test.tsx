/**
 * A non-interactive lookup offers no way to clear its value (objectui#10120).
 *
 * ## What was measured
 *
 * `readonly` has always returned a display-only rendering, so it was never the
 * gap. `disabled` was: it disabled the picker trigger and the "Browse all
 * records" button and left the selected chip's ✕ fully live — one widget,
 * two opposite answers to "may this user change this value?", with the live
 * one being the only control that could actually change it. Measured on the
 * card's form: trigger `disabled=true`, browse `disabled=true`, chip remove
 * `disabled=false`.
 *
 * ## Why `disabled` is the case that matters here
 *
 * It is how BOTH of this card's refusals arrive at the widget. A field the
 * object declares `readonly` is folded into `disabled` by the form's section
 * builder, and a field the caller's permission set marks `editable: false` is
 * marked `readOnly` AND `disabled` by the form's field-permission pass. So the
 * reporter in the card could clear the master-detail parent 「所属填报单」 on a
 * sheet line — a write the server then refuses. ⭐ A refusal the UI invites is
 * worse than a refusal it prevents.
 *
 * The chips themselves stay: the value is readable, and hiding it would lose
 * information the user is entitled to. Only the affordance goes.
