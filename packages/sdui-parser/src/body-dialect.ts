/**
 * ObjectUI — the retired `body` child-list dialect (objectui#6771)
 *
 * `body` was a declared twin of `children` on `BaseSchema`, and for a long
 * while it was the ONLY child-list key a dozen registrations read. This tier
 * never knew it: `BASE_PROPS` lists `children` and not `body`, so the one
 * spelling that resolved drew `unknown-prop` — the same warning a typo draws,
 * on the tier built to accept AI-authored pages, where the diagnostic IS the
 * contract. The maintainer ruled the retirement (2026-09-01, option B): one
 * concept, one spelling, and the spelling is `children`.
 *
 * This module is the tier's half of that ruling. It REPLACES the diagnostic the
 * prop walk would otherwise emit for `body`, rather than adding to it — two
 * diagnostics for one mistake is the shape `checkMemberTypes` already refuses
 * (objectui#8067), and it is the shape `checkKanbanQuickAdd` is written against
 * next door.
 *
 * WHY A REPLACEMENT AND NOT A BARE `unknown-prop`. After the retirement
 * "`<badge>` has no prop body" is TRUE — but it is the answer that sent authors
 * the wrong way in the first place. Every `body` node in this repository's own
 * docs, examples and READMEs was migrated in the same change, and an author
 * carrying the old spelling in from anywhere else needs the replacement NAMED,
 * not merely the key refused. The two codes below are the ruling's own words:
 * the tier teaches `children` only, and a `body` child list under a
 * non-container draws the same `not-a-container` the `children` spelling draws.
 *
 * SCOPE — deliberately the opposite of `checkKanbanQuickAdd`'s. That one is
 * asked AHEAD of the declaration lookup, because its claim is about the render
 * path and declaring the key must not disarm it. This one is asked INSIDE the
 * `!input` branch, because its claim is about a key nobody declares: a
 * component that publishes its own `body` input keeps its declared type check
 * untouched. Re-derived against the registry rather than recalled: exactly one
 * registration in the tree declares an input named `body`, and it is
 * `record:alert` (`plugin-detail`, `register('alert', …, { namespace: 'record' })`),
 * whose `body` takes an inline translation map and is not this spelling.
 * Control on the same sweep: `name: 'children'` fires seven times.
