/**
 * objectui#7696 — WHICH of the five starvation paths produces the REPORTED
 * symptom. A measurement, not a fix: no production file changes.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The card's original claim — that a LOCAL select dimension on a CHART widget
 * was a 2x2 cell nobody covered — was falsified and the card was deliberately
 * kept OPEN, because the SYMPTOM was not falsified: a console really does paint
 * `One-off / Recurring / Standing` in a pie legend under a Chinese title,
 * description and axis labels, with the neighbouring LIST VIEW of the same
 * field rendering the translation correctly. Nothing in the relabel path
 * explains that, so the English has to come from one of the five ways this
 * best-effort net starves. Triage re-scoped the card to: decide which one.
 *
 * Every path below is driven. The two that were nominated as likely are NOT
 * driven alone — a reading that only ever exercises its own hypothesis cannot
 * fail, so the other three are driven too, as negative controls.
 *
 * ## The instrument: a FINGERPRINT, not a verdict
 *
 * The reporter could observe four things at once, and it is the COMBINATION
 * that discriminates — every one of the five paths turns the chart English, so
 * the chart alone distinguishes nothing:
 *
 * | axis           | what it reads                                            |
 * |----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
 * | `chart`        | the pie categories the chart renderer receives            |
 * | `list`         | the neighbouring list view's cell for the same field      |
 * | `serverChrome` | chrome the SERVER resolved: a series label off `fields[]` |
 * | `bundleChrome` | an app-bundle-scoped string (the widget title's channel)  |
 * | `metaReads`    | what the chart's metadata channel asked for, and got      |
 *
 * `serverChrome` and `bundleChrome` are separated deliberately: the reporter
 * saw Chinese chrome, and the chrome has TWO independent sources. The axis and
 * series labels come off the analytics response (the card measured
 * `fields[].label` switching with `accept-language` while `rows[]` did not, so
 * the locale reaches the endpoint). The title and description come out of the
 * app's i18n bundle. A path that kills the bundle kills the second and not the
 * first, and that is precisely what excludes it from the report.
 *
 * `bundleChrome` is read through `fieldLabel` rather than through a dashboard
 * title. Same channel, one resolver over: EVERY resolver in `useObjectLabel`
 * funnels through the same `resolve` helper, which is gated on
 * `getAppNamespaces()`. So `fieldLabel` stands in for the whole app-bundle
 * surface of the page — when it degrades, the widget title degrades with it,
 * and when it holds, the title holds.
 *
 * ## The fixture is the card's own, verbatim
 *
 * `duly_duty_register` on `duly_duty`, one LOCAL `form` dimension (a select
 * with three options), a pie with `showLegend: true`, and rows arriving
 * SERVER-RESOLVED to the object's authored ENGLISH labels (ADR-0021) — the
 * exact bytes the card measured off `POST /api/v1/analytics/dataset/query`,
 * with `fields[].label` already Chinese in the same payload.
 *
 * ## The neighbouring LIST leg, and why it is built this way
 *
 * The list is modelled as the two steps `ObjectGrid` takes, in order, with the
 * same inputs: it reads the object document through the DataSource
 * (`getObjectSchema`), runs that field's `options` through
 * `useSafeFieldLabel().translateOptions`, and renders the value through
 * `SelectCellRenderer` — which is the renderer the field registry resolves
 * `select` to, and which reads `option.label` and nothing else.
 *
 * Two properties of that wiring are load-bearing here and both are real:
 *
 * 1. **The list's metadata read is a DIFFERENT CHANNEL from the chart's.** The
 *    list asks the DataSource, which carries the session credential in its own
 *    authenticated fetch wrapper; the analytics net asks
 *    `SchemaRendererContext.apiFetch ?? fetch` — falling back to the GLOBAL
 *    fetch when no host installed one. That asymmetry is objectui#4121's
 *    reported shape and it is what path (2) is.
 * 2. **Both channels terminate on the SAME document**, `GET
 *    /api/v1/meta/object/<name>`. So a document that carries no inline
 *    `options` starves BOTH — unless the list's own column declares options,
 *    which the grid prefers over the object document. Path (3) is measured in
 *    both of those sub-cases below, because they do not give the same answer.
