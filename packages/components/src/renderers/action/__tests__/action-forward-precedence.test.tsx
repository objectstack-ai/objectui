/**
 * objectui#4281 — the hoist that restored the compiler's excess-property check
 * must not have changed what reaches the runner.
 *
 * `action:button` and `action:icon` used to compose their payload as ONE literal
 * with the spreads inline:
 *
 *   execute({ type, name, …, ...paramsPayload, …, resultDialog, ...localContext })
 *
 * A literal that spreads an `any` is not excess-property checked (`localContext`
 * is `any` — `PropsWithoutRef` collapses these index-signature props interfaces),
 * so an invented key was absorbed in silence while `action:group` / `action:menu`
 * rejected it. The fix hoists the explicit keys into an `ActionDef`-annotated
 * binding and composes the spreads around it.
 *
 * That is a REFACTOR of an object literal, and object literals have two
 * observable properties a refactor can silently change — which key wins a
 * collision, and what order the keys end up in. Both are pinned here.
 *
 * ## What the collision semantics actually are (measured, not assumed)
 *
 *   `...localContext` is spread LAST, so a host-supplied context key OVERRIDES
 *   the authored action's own value for that key. That is pre-existing
 *   behaviour and is deliberately preserved: `context` is documented as an
 *   "Override context for this specific action".
 *
 *   `...paramsPayload` (`action:button` only) can carry only `params` or
 *   `actionParams`, and NEITHER is an explicit key of the surrounding literal —
 *   the two key sets are disjoint, so its position cannot decide a collision.
 *   It is nonetheless kept in its original position, so the resulting key ORDER
 *   is unchanged too, and that is asserted rather than argued.
 *
 * ## Why key ORDER is worth pinning and not over-pinning
 *
 * Nothing in the runner reads `Object.keys(def)` today, so order is not a
 * contract — but it is the sharpest available evidence that the composition is
 * byte-for-byte what it was. Moving `...paramsPayload` to the end (the obvious
 * way to write this fix) changes the order and nothing else; without this
 * assertion that refactor would be indistinguishable from the correct one.
