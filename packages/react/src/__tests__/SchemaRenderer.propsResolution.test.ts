 * objectui#4548 — COMPILE-TIME pins on the props a `SchemaRenderer` JSX call
 * site is actually held to. The sibling of `plugin-list`'s and
 * `plugin-dashboard`'s `*.propsResolution` pins (objectui#4528 / PR #4551).
 *
 * These assertions are erased at runtime; `tsc` is the only thing that can
 * check them, which is why this file is carried by
 * `packages/react/tsconfig.test.json` and why the `expect` below is deliberately
 * trivial — the real assertions are the `Assert< Equal< … > >` types, and a
 * violation is a compile error, not a red test.
 *
 * ## What was measured before the fix
 *
 * Probed on the pre-fix source, compiled through this same project:
 *
 *     keyof ComponentProps< typeof SchemaRenderer >            ->  string
 *     ComponentProps< typeof SchemaRenderer >['schema']        ->  any
 *     ({ schema: SchemaNode } & Record< string, any >)['schema'] ->  SchemaNode
 *
 * and — the half the sibling packages did not have — these three all compiled
 * SILENTLY, which is the same defect seen from the other side:
 *
 *     < SchemaRenderer / >                       // no schema at all
 *     < SchemaRenderer schema={12345} / >
 *     < SchemaRenderer schema={{…}} bogusProp={1} / >
 *
 * The declaration was right and nobody was held to it. The props type argument
 * carried `Record< string, any >`, which puts `string` into `keyof Props`, so
 * React's `PropsWithoutRef` took its `Omit` branch and `Omit` over a string
 * index signature keeps ONLY the index signature.
 *
 * ## What is pinned, and what is deliberately NOT
 *
 * The forwarding surface is intentionally still open — this is the renderer
 * loop, and `packages/react/README.md` documents forwarding a component's own
 * props through it. So `keyof` is still `string` and an unknown prop is still
 * accepted; assertion 6 pins that openness as a DECISION rather than leaving it
 * to be read as the bug it used to be. What is pinned is that the openness no
 * longer costs the declared props: `schema` is typed, and it is required.
 */

/*
 * The `Assert< … >` aliases below are the assertions themselves — they are
 * deliberately never referenced, and a violation is a COMPILE error rather than
 * a use site. `no-unused-vars` has nothing to say about that here.
