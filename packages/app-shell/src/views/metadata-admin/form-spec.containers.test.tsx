/**
 * The two form CONTAINERS are one declaration each, derived from the spec —
 * objectui#5596.
 *
 * ## The defect this closes
 *
 * objectui#5040 / #5542 are one contract described several times, each
 * description only ever checked against itself. #5542 converged the LEAF
 * (`FormFieldSpec`). The two containers above it — `FormSectionSpec` and
 * `FormViewSpec` — were still hand-declared twice, once here and once in
 * `apps/console`'s `FormPage.tsx`, and unlike the leaf they had ALREADY drifted
 * in both directions, so neither was a subset of the other:
 *
 *   FormSectionSpec  this side had `description` / `visibleWhen` / `visibleOn`,
 *                    the console had none of them; the console's `columns`
 *                    admitted the string arm, this side's did not.
 *   FormViewSpec     the console had `label` / `groups` / `sharing` /
 *                    `submitBehavior`, this side stopped at `type` + `sections`.
 *
 * Two live answers to "what may an author write", one nesting level above a
 * contract that had just been converged.
 *
 * ## What is pinned, and by which tool
 *
 *   • **`tsc`** — {@link formContainerContractPins}. Type assertions are erased
 *     at runtime, so vitest proves nothing about them; this package's
 *     `type-check` script (`tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`, the only project that
 *     compiles this directory's tests) is what judges them. The DERIVATION pins
 *     are the ones that close the class: they compare the non-narrowed half of
 *     each type against `@objectstack/spec`'s own `FormSection` / `FormView`, so
 *     re-hand-writing either declaration fails here the day the spec moves,
 *     rather than years later when someone reads two files side by side. Each
 *     narrowing has a matching negative pin, so "derived" can never quietly
 *     become "widened to whatever the spec says". PIN I extends that promise
 *     down one level, to the LEAF's option element (objectui#6263): its two
 *     narrowings — `visibleWhen` re-pointed, `default` dropped — were the last
 *     ones resting on a comment alone, and `default` is the one a maintainer
 *     actually ruled on.
 *   • **vitest** — the render block. The widening this convergence performs is
 *     asserted INERT and, for `columns`, load-bearing: a section that spells its
 *     column count as the string `'3'` — legal metadata `FormSectionSchema`
 *     accepts and this renderer used to refuse at the type level — lays out
 *     identically to the numeric `3`. A pin that only proved the key
 *     type-checks would go green against a value the renderer mangles.
