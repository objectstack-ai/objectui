/**
 * objectui#9269 — the grid column-summary footer's percent branch stops
 * re-spelling `percentDisplayValue` and stops appending a literal '%'.
 *
 * `formatSummaryLabel`'s `colType === 'percent'` arm held a hand-inlined copy
 * of the declared source's body plus an ASCII percent sign:
 *
 *   const decimals = column?.precision ?? 0;
 *   const pct = (value > -1 && value < 1) ? value * 100 : value;
 *   formatted = `${pct.toFixed(decimals)}%`;
 *
 * ⚠️ That block is quoted as HISTORY and left verbatim. Line 1 has since
 * moved again: objectui#9295 answered the member question this card fenced,
 * and the arm now reads `column?.scale ?? 0`.
 *
 * Line 2 is `percentDisplayValue` in `@object-ui/core` character for
 * character, so the SCALING agreed — by duplication, not by reference. The
 * CONVENTION was not taken at all. `percentDisplayValue`'s own doc comment
 * makes that the judgement rather than a style preference: "If a third surface
 * ever needs percent display, it takes BOTH halves from here — the scaling AND
 * the convention — or this promise breaks again in the same place."
 *
 * ── What this file measures ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The claim is AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO SURFACES — the footer and the list cell
 * directly above it — so every moving row compares the hook's own label
 * against the declared source computed in the same run (`formatPercent`, which
 * applies `percentDisplayValue` and renders through the locale's percent
 * affix). A hand-written expected string would restate one side and could not
 * fail for the reason the card names.
 *
 * ⭐ A two-surface comparison is blind to a JOINT move: a repair that dragged
 * both sides would keep the equality true. That is what the absolute-byte
 * controls are for, and it is the one place a literal is the right instrument.
 *
 * ── Which rows can actually fire ────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⛔ The `en` rows below four digits are NOT controls for this card: a bare
 * '%' and the locale affix coincide there, so they read the same either way.
 * They are overshoot detectors, pinned to exact bytes. The rows that MOVE —
 * and therefore the ones that measure the repair — are `de-DE` (no-break space
 * before the sign), `tr-TR` (the sign moves to the FRONT of the number) and
 * four-digit `en` (grouping).
 *
 * ── Directions, predicted in writing BEFORE the first run ───────────────
 *   en 0.25 / 1 / -5 / 12.3     GREEN on the base tree — sanity, not controls
 *   en 1234.5                   RED on the base tree  (1235%  -> 1,235%)
 *   de-DE 0.25 / 1234.5         RED on the base tree  (25%    -> 25 %,
 *                                                      1235%  -> 1.235 %)
 *   tr-TR 0.25 / 1234.5         RED on the base tree  (25%    -> %25,
 *                                                      1235%  -> %1.235)
 *   the prefix guard            GREEN on the base tree
