/**
 * objectui#7334 — the FORWARDING half: ListView puts the authored view-level
 * `navigation` on the gantt node, and on NO other node.
 *
 * The sibling of `ListView.gantt-binding-7070` next door, and the same harness:
 * a registered spy stands in for `object-gantt` and reports the schema it was
 * handed. The RESOLUTION half — that `ObjectGantt` then makes the authored mode
 * out of it, rather than its `?? { mode: 'drawer' }` fallback — is pinned in
 * `plugin-gantt/src/ObjectGantt.navigationModeResolution-7334.test.tsx`.
 *
 * THE DEFECT. `ObjectGantt` owns a record drawer of its own and resolves
 * `const navConfig = schema.navigation ?? { mode: 'drawer' }`, classifying four
 * overlay modes (`drawer` / `modal` / `split` / `popover`). Nothing ever put
 * `navigation` on the node it receives — `baseProps` declares no such key, and
 * the `case 'gantt'` branch added only the data keys — so that `??` was the
 * only branch ever taken and a view authoring `navigation: { mode: 'page' }`
 * got a drawer with no diagnostic. The other view types do not have this
 * problem for the opposite reason: their wrappers spread host props, so
 * ListView's own overlay decides through `onRowClick`.
 *
 * ⭐ WHY THE ASSERTIONS NAME A MODE. The defect's shape is "a drawer opens
 * anyway", so a test asserting only that something opened is blind to it by
 * construction — it was green before the repair and is green after. Every
 * assertion below reads the mode value that reaches the node.
 *
 * ⭐ WHY THE `case 'gantt'` BRANCH AND NOT `baseProps` — measured, not
 * preferred, and the cross-view cases at the bottom are that measurement.
 * SEVEN other child views read `schema.navigation` themselves (grid, gallery,
 * kanban, calendar, map, timeline, tree) and every one of them also receives
 * `onRowClick: navigation.handleClick` from `baseProps`, which
 * `useNavigationOverlay` gives FULL priority over any `navigation` handed in.
 * On `baseProps` the key would therefore arrive at seven views and either be
 * outranked outright (six of them pass `onRowClick` unconditionally) or flip
 * behaviour (calendar mirrors gantt's `navIsOverlay ? undefined : onRowClick`,
 * so an authored `page` would stop it suppressing the host handler). Two
 * sources of truth for one question. Gantt is the only branch where forwarding
 * settles the question instead of splitting it, because its wrapper drops host
 * props entirely (objectui#7210 / objectui#7222) and there is no `onRowClick`
 * there to outrank anything.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted before running: delete the
 * `...(schema.navigation ? { navigation: schema.navigation } : {})` line from
 * the gantt branch and the three FORWARDS cases go red (each reads `undefined`
 * where it asserts a mode) while the FALLBACK case and every cross-view case
 * stay green.
