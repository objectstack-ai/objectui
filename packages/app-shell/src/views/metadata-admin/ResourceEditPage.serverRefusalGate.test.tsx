/**
 * Pins the BLOCKING half of the save-gate carve-out (objectui#8057) — the half
 * `ResourceEditPage.schemaAdvisory.test.tsx` does not cover.
 *
 * ## The boundary these two suites pin between them
 *
 *   server-REFUSED  →  BLOCKS   (this suite)
 *   server-ACCEPTED →  advisory (`ResourceEditPage.schemaAdvisory.test.tsx`)
 *
 * "Advisory" was only ever about a verdict this client PREDICTS. A verdict the
 * server RETURNED is a different thing, and the objectui#4306 / #6980 reasoning
 * never covered it: that reasoning is conditioned on the server ACCEPTING the
 * draft, and a 422 is the server saying it does not. Neither suite may be read
 * without the other — a carve-out with only its blocking half pinned is
 * indistinguishable from having deleted the advisory ruling.
 *
 * ## The measured wedge, and why `inspectorBlocking` cannot close it
 *
 * objectui#8057 measured, against a real 17.3.0 backend: add a Lookup field
 * with an empty target, and the auto-save PUTs a document the server refuses
 * with `fields.lookup.reference`. Then rename an unrelated, already-saved
 * field — and the same half-filled document is PUT again, refused again, while
 * the designer renders the rename as applied and the server has none of it.
 *
 * The existing block (`inspectorBlocking`) is stamped with the current
 * SELECTION and expires when it changes — which IS step 2 of that
 * reproduction. So the discriminating pin in this file is not "the refused
 * document stops being sent"; it is **the block survives the selection moving
 * off the offending element**. An implementation that reuses `inspectorBlocking`
 * as-is passes every other assertion here and fails that one.
 *
 * ## Why each negative assertion carries a lit control
 *
 * "The refused document is not re-sent" is a claim about a call that did NOT
 * happen, and it passes vacuously in a harness where the save could never have
 * fired at all (not dirty, not editing, auto-save off, the draft never reaching
 * the gate). Every such assertion below is therefore paired with a control that
 * fires the same call on the same harness with the refusal absent.
 *
 * Stubbing mirrors the sibling suites: only the page CANVAS is stubbed (to emit
 * a selection) and the CEL engine is stubbed deterministically. The Zod pass,
 * the save doors, the gate and this host's real blocking are all shipping code.
