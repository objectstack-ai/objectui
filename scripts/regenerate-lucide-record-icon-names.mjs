/**
 * Regenerates `packages/components/src/lib/lucide-record-icon-names.ts` — the
 * BUILD-GENERATED static list of the icon names the seam accepts, and the
 * kebab-case spelling each one loads.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `renderers/action/resolve-icon.ts` used to answer "is this a legal icon
 * name?" by INDEXING lucide's runtime `icons` record. A namespace object has no
 * dead members, so that one index pulled EVERY icon module into the eager
 * closure: measured on the console build at `ac05d4f4dd`, 1,781 icon module
 * definitions inside `assets/ui-components-*.js` — 1,499 KB raw of a 1,535,917
 * byte chunk. The record was the payload, and the name list was free only
 * because the payload was already there.
 *
 * ⛔ So the membership set may NOT be derived from `Object.keys(icons)`: that
 * derivation IS the eager record, written a second way. Deriving it would pin
 * the record eager for as long as anything asked a name question — which is
 * what objectui#9204's rescue option A proposed and what the ruling on
 * objectui#9251 refused, verbatim: 「合法图标名集合由构建期生成的静态名单提供
 * (⛔ 不从 `Object.keys(icons)` 推导)」.
 *
 * ── What it reads instead ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * lucide's OWN export manifest, `lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/index.mjs`, which
 * is the file the `icons` record is built from:
 *
 *     export { default as Trash2 } from './trash-2.mjs';
 *
 * Each line carries BOTH spellings this repo needs — the PascalCase key the
 * seam looks names up by, and the kebab-case module name `DynamicIcon` loads.
 * Reading the manifest as TEXT is what keeps the generation off the record: no
 * icon module is ever imported here, so nothing about this script can bring one
 * into anybody's bundle.
 *
 * ⚠️ The second spelling is not decoration and ⛔ must not be replaced by a
 * conversion rule at the call site. 95 of the 1,781 keys do not survive one:
 * `Trash2` is `trash-2`, `ArrowDown01` is `arrow-down-0-1`, `Axis3d` is
 * `axis-3d`. A PascalCase-to-kebab regex silently produces `trash2`,
 * `arrow-down01` and `axis3d`, none of which `dynamicIconImports` can load —
 * and the failure surfaces as an icon that renders nothing, with no error.
 *
 * ── The three preconditions it refuses to write without ────────────────────
 *
 * Each one is a way this generator could produce a plausible-looking file that
 * is wrong, so each is checked rather than assumed:
 *
 *   1. The parse found icons at all, and a known pair is among them. A regex
 *      that stops matching after a lucide release upgrade would otherwise write
 *      an empty or truncated list and every icon in the product would stop
 *      resolving, quietly, with the gate green.
 *   2. Every kebab spelling is a key of `dynamicIconImports`. That map is what
 *      the seam loads through; a name that is in the record but not in the map
 *      resolves to a component that throws on mount instead of to `null`.
 *   3. The PascalCase keys are unique and the kebab targets are unique. The
 *      table is a bijection today; an aliasing release would make the decoded
 *      map lossy in a way no consumer could detect.
 *
 * The equality between this derivation and lucide's runtime record is asserted
 * SEPARATELY, in `scripts/check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs`, which already
 * loads the record for its own judgement. Keeping the record out of this script
 * is the point; keeping the comparison is what proves the manifest is the same
 * vocabulary.
 *
 * Run:    node scripts/regenerate-lucide-record-icon-names.mjs
 * Verify: node scripts/regenerate-lucide-record-icon-names.mjs --check
 * Gated:  `pnpm check:icon-record-names` runs the same comparison as part 4 of
 *         the census gate, so a drifted file fails CI without a second step.
