/**
 * Every key taught on a `**Keys:**` bullet in `.github/prompts/**` must be
 * answered by a REAL renderer — not only by the opt-in protocol placeholder
 * (objectui#8929).
 *
 *   Run:  node scripts/check-prompt-component-keys.mjs   (`pnpm check:prompt-keys`)
 *   Exit: 0 = every taught key resolves to a real component
 *         1 = a taught key resolves to nothing, or resolves only to the
 *             placeholder panel, or this gate's own derivation collapsed
 *
 * ## The defect, and why the obvious fix is a no-op
 *
 * `.github/prompts/**` is read by an AI that then writes metadata. A stale key
 * there is not one wrong page: it is every generated document reaching for a
 * key the registry no longer answers with anything renderable.
 *
 * The card that opened this gate found two such keys on one bullet, `view:kanban`
 * and `view:gantt`, retired with the bare `kanban` / `gantt` registrations
 * (objectui#8802, objectui#8008). The instinctive fixes both fail:
 *
 *   DELETE THE TWO   a hand list that drifted once drifts again, which is the
 *                    reason the card was filed rather than patched.
 *   RE-DERIVE FROM   `known-schema-types.ts` STILL CONTAINS BOTH. They are
 *   THE GENERATED    members of `PROTOCOL_COMPONENTS`, and `registerPlaceholder`
 *   KNOWN-TYPE LIST  is a real `ComponentRegistry.register(...)` call. So the
 *                    generated list answers "yes" and the correction is a no-op.
 *
 * The two sets differ, and naming the difference is this gate:
 *
 *   what RESOLVES   every registered key, placeholders included. That is the
 *                   question `objectui check` asks, and asking it of a prompt
 *                   is what let `view:kanban` validate green and draw nothing.
 *   what is AUTHORABLE  a key some registration OTHER than the protocol
 *                   placeholder answers. That is the question a prompt teaching
 *                   an author must ask.
 *
 * ## Where the exclusion comes from — the placeholder module's own declaration
 *
 * ⛔ NOT from a list of key names typed here; that list is the drift this gate
 * exists about. The universe comes from `deriveRegistryKeys` — the SAME
 * derivation that judges documentation snippets (objectui#4823) and generates
 * the CLI's known-type list (objectui#5115) — which records, per key, the SITES
 * that register it. `INDIRECT_REGISTRATIONS` declares the placeholder module
 * and the `protocol-placeholder` namespace it registers under; a key whose
 * every site is that module is placeholder-only, and every other key is
 * authorable. Move a key out of `PROTOCOL_COMPONENTS` into a real plugin and
 * this gate follows it live, with nothing here to edit.
 *
 * If that declaration ever stops naming a `protocol-placeholder` entry, or the
 * exclusion stops removing anything, the run FAILS rather than passing: an
 * exclusion that excludes nothing silently collapses this gate back into the
 * generous question, which is the no-op above.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT checked: completeness
 *
 * The bullets end in `etc.` — they are examples, and the file makes no claim to
 * enumerate the registry. So the direction judged is containment: what the
 * prompt names must exist and must render. The other direction (a new renderer
 * lands, the prompt does not mention it) leaves the prompt incomplete, never
 * WRONG, and gating it would red on every plugin that ships.
 *
 * ## The second reading model: LABELLED BLOCKS (objectui#9098)
 *
 * A `Keys:` bullet puts every key on ONE line, which is why the rule above is
 * "the Keys LINE only". The prompt teaches component keys in four more places
 * that are shaped differently — `Standard Components Library:` and two
 * `Required Components:` bullets whose keys live in SUB-BULLETS, each followed
 * by trailing prose. Widening the label set alone would have read nothing:
 * those label lines carry no keys at all. So this gate carries a second reading
 * model, and the token-selection rule it states is:
 *
 *   A GATED LABEL is a bolded bullet label drawn from a fixed set. It opens a
 *   BLOCK: the contiguous run of lines indented strictly MORE than the label's
 *   own bullet, ending at the first non-blank line indented at or below it (or
 *   at end of file). Inside that block only LIST-ITEM lines are read, and from
 *   each, every single-backticked token WITHOUT whitespace in it is taken as a
 *   key. Fenced code is skipped everywhere.
 *
 * Everything else is prose and is never judged. That is four escape hatches, and
 * the prompt surface uses all four today:
 *
 *   OUTSIDE THE BLOCK    a blockquote or paragraph at the section's own level
 *                        is not in the label's sub-tree. This is where the
 *                        tombstones live — the note naming `view:kanban` and
 *                        `view:gantt` as retired, the one naming `user:profile`,
 *                        the one naming `ai:chat_window` as deliberately
 *                        unregistered. Every one of those is a key this gate
 *                        would reject if it read it, which is precisely why a
 *                        "do not write this" example has to stay unjudged.
 *   NOT A LIST ITEM      a continuation paragraph indented under the label is
 *                        skipped even though it IS in the block.
 *   BACKTICKED PROSE     a backticked span with a space in it is a command or a
 *                        phrase, never a key: `pnpm check:prompt-keys`,
 *                        `objectui check`. Not one of the 650 derived keys has
 *                        whitespace in it, so nothing real is skipped here.
 *   NOT BACKTICKED       trailing prose on a sub-bullet — `(Lucide Wrapper)`,
 *                        `: Standalone smart button.`, `(Sub-grid)` — carries no
 *                        backticks and so contributes nothing. An author who
 *                        needs to name a NON-key in that prose writes it without
 *                        backticks, or moves the note out of the block.
 *
 * ## Two verdicts, because a placeholder list is a claim too
 *
 * `Protocol Placeholders:` is gated with the partition INVERTED: every key under
 * it must be placeholder-only. A list of protocol placeholders is as much a
 * factual claim as a list of components, and it drifts the same way — if
 * `ai:input` gains a real renderer the section is stale, and if it loses its
 * registration entirely the section names nothing at all. Without the inverted
 * leg, "move the placeholder-only keys to a placeholder section" would have
 * moved the drift rather than fixed it.
 *
 * ## Why a block that opens and reads nothing is a failure
 *
 * `bullets === 0` catches the `Keys:` surface disappearing. The block model's
 * equivalent is narrower and stronger: a gated label that matches but whose
 * block yields no keys means the section was reformatted so the keys moved out
 * from under it — the gate would then judge nothing while printing a pass.

/**
 * Every `### X.` letter run in the prompt surface, grouped by the `## N.`
 * section that scopes it (objectui#9145).
 *
 * ## What this reads, and why it is a SEQUENCE check rather than a count
 *
 * `.github/prompts/component.prompt.md` opened §1 with a hand-written "these 3
 * standard slots" over seven sections, and those seven ran `A B D E F G H` — no
 * `C`. Both halves were wrong in the file's FIRST commit (`4e7737788`), so
 * neither is a drift from a state that was once true: the inventory was never
 * measured against the list it describes.
 *
 * The two halves are repaired differently, and only one of them needs a gate:
 *
 *   THE COUNT      deleted, not pinned. The sentence no longer states a number,
 *                  so there is no second place for the inventory to be written
 *                  down and no way for the two to disagree. A gate comparing a
 *                  stated count to a heading count would exist only to keep a
 *                  construct alive that has no reason to be there.
 *   THE LETTERING  pinned here. A letter run is not a duplicate of anything —
 *                  it IS the inventory — so it cannot be deleted, and a gap in
 *                  it is exactly the reading that cost this card: a missing
 *                  letter says "a section was dropped" to an AI author that
 *                  reads these files as authoritative, and the file itself does
 *                  not say whether that is true.
 *
 * ## Why a run is scoped to its `## N.` section
 *
 * `component.prompt.md` carries a SECOND, independent letter run further down
 * (`### A. Field Widget Implementation`, `### B. Dashboard Widget
 * Implementation`) under `## 2. API Reference & Contracts`, and
 * `engine.prompt.md` carries five. Each restarts at `A`, so a file-wide
 * sequence check would red on every correct file here. The section heading is
 * the boundary the author already writes.
 *
 * Sections with no letter headings (`## 2. Standard Contexts` in
 * `engine.prompt.md`, whose sub-headings are backticked type names) are
 * returned too, carrying an empty `entries`. They contribute no run, and the
 * caller needs them to tell "this surface has no letter runs because it has no
 * sections" (a fixture tree exercising the key vocabulary) apart from "this
 * surface has sections and every run in them has vanished" (the collapse).
 * ⛔ This does NOT judge the `## N.` numbers themselves — that is a different
 * vocabulary and a different claim.
