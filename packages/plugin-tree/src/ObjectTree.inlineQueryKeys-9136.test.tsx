/**
 * objectui#9136 — a `provider: 'value'` tree honours the two query keys the
 * fetching path honours: `filter` and the objectui#7210 row ceiling. The fourth
 * surface of the objectui#8769 / objectui#9061 short-circuit;
 * `ObjectCalendar.inlineQueryKeys-9061.test.tsx` and
 * `ObjectMap.inlineQueryKeys-9061.test.tsx` are the twins.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * The record effect short-circuited the inline provider (`setRecords(items)`;
 * return) and never reached the `find`, which is the ONE site in the file that
 * lowers `schema.filter` to `$filter` and the ceiling to `$top`. An authored
 * `filter` therefore reached nothing and every inline row was drawn — the
 * fail-OPEN direction: the key that was ignored is the key that NARROWS, so the
 * author saw MORE nodes than declared, with no diagnostic.
 *
 * ⛔ Not a data-exposure boundary. The rows are already in the authored schema;
 * what is wrong is that the tree answers a question nobody asked.
 *
 * ## Two keys, not three
 *
 * `ObjectTree` reads `schema.sort` on NO provider, so there is no `inlineSort`
 * row here, unlike the twins. Sort on the tree is a question about the OBJECT
 * path as well, and it is not this card's.
 *
 * ## The two-sided reading is the finding
 *
 * A one-sided reproduction cannot tell "the filter was ignored" from "the
 * filter matched everything", so `twoSidedFilter` renders the SAME rows and the
 * SAME filter twice — once inline, once through a context adapter that is
 * itself a `ValueDataSource` over those rows — and reads the DISAGREEMENT.
 *
 * ## ORDER: filter first, ceiling second (objectui#7210 ruling a′)
 *
 * The ceiling is applied to the FILTERED set, matching the fetching path.
 * `ceilingOrder` pins it from the observable side: a set that is over the
 * ceiling BEFORE filtering and under it after draws every matching row and
 * shows NO footnote.
 *
 * ⚠️ MEASURED CONSEQUENCE, reported rather than hidden: an author who supplies
 * more than `NON_GRID_ROW_CEILING` inline rows now sees fewer nodes than they
 * supplied. `ceilingCap` is that measurement. It is the ruled behaviour rather
 * than a silent loss — ruling a′'s budget is measured in DOM ELEMENTS PER
 * RECORD, the tree is the view that budget was measured on, and
 * `NonGridRowCeilingNote` names BOTH numbers on screen. On a tree the footnote
 * carries a second fact the picture cannot: a hierarchy drawn from the first N
 * rows reparents every node whose parent fell past the cut to a root.
 *
 * ## The clone the adapter now makes (objectui#9061 ruling A, objectui#9175)
 *
 * Routing inline rows through `ValueDataSource` routes them through its
 * constructor clone. That clone is `structuredClone`, not a JSON round-trip,
 * so an inline value still never has to be serializable — the objectui#6018
 * guarantee `ObjectMap.dataConfigMemo.test.tsx` pins for the map.
 * `backReferenceGraph` pins the same guarantee on this route.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted BEFORE running, from the committed
 * fix, by restoring the early return in `ObjectTree.tsx`: `twoSidedFilter`,
 * `ceilingCap` and `ceilingOrder` go RED; `control`, `backReferenceGraph` and
 * `providerBackedControl` stay GREEN — the first draws the same rows either
 * way, the second draws its graph with or without the clone, and the third
 * never touches the inline path at all, which is what makes them controls.
 *
 * ## HOW THE INLINE ROWS ARE SPELLED HERE
 *
 * `{ provider: 'value', items }` under `schema.data`, and NO `data` PROP. The
 * `data` prop (and a bare array under `schema.data`) is the host-data
 * passthrough above the inline branch — rows a parent already queried, a
 * different question (objectui#7333's class) that this card does not touch.
