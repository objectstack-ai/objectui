 * objectui#8651 — `ObjectCalendar` is typed at the PUBLISHED schema of the
 * element it is registered as, and every key it reads off the node is declared
 * there.
 *
 * ## What was measured, and why the card's three-way split collapsed to two
 *
 * The card filed twelve keys in two classes — four undeclared on both arms of
 * `ObjectGridSchema | CalendarSchema`, eight declared on exactly ONE arm — and
 * asked, as its FIRST question, whether that union is right at all. Measured
 * with the TypeScript checker on the merge-base (`getPropertyOfType`, never a
 * grep — objectui#8410), the answer decides eleven of the twelve at once:
 *
 * ⚠️ Note what the union itself answers, because it is easy to get backwards
 * and this file's first cut did: on the UNION only SEVEN of the fifteen reads
 * were undeclared. `ObjectGridSchema` carries `BaseSchema`'s index signature,
 * so the five `CalendarSchema`-only keys resolved through it and compiled with
 * no cast — silently typed `any`, which is the defect rather than the absence
 * of one. Per-ARM is the reading the card tabled; per-UNION is the reading the
 * compiler acts on; they are different numbers and both are measured here.
 *
 *   `ObjectCalendarSchema` — this repo's published interface for the
 *   `object-calendar` element, and its zod mirror — ALREADY declares eleven of
 *   the fifteen keys this renderer reads, `allDayField`, `startDateField`,
 *   `endDateField`, `titleField`, `colorField` and `defaultView` among them
 *   (objectui#8466, #8174, #8314, #9239). Neither arm of the union it was
 *   actually annotated with is that interface.
 *
 * ⇒ the reads were never undeclared for want of a declaration; they were
 * undeclared because the props type pointed somewhere else. Both arms go:
 *
 *   - `ObjectGridSchema` is `type: 'object-grid'`. Nothing hands this component
 *     one — the single production call site is this package's own
 *     `index.tsx`, and both of its registrations (`object-calendar` and
 *     `calendar`) publish `OBJECT_CALENDAR_INPUTS`, the `object-calendar`
 *     surface.
 *   - `CalendarSchema` was declared LOCALLY in `ObjectCalendar.tsx`, absent
 *     from this package's barrel — so no importer could ever name it — and it
 *     SHADOWED `@object-ui/types`' own published `CalendarSchema`, which is the
 *     date-picker primitive (`form.ts`, reachable at `ui:calendar` only,
 *     objectui#8499). Two layers, one word.
 *
 * The shape this leaves is the one every sibling widget in the family already
 * has: `ObjectKanban` takes `ObjectKanbanSchema`, `ObjectGantt` takes
 * `ObjectGanttSchema`, `ObjectMap` takes `ObjectMapSchema` — and `plugin-map`
 * is registered under TWO tags (`object-map` and `map`) with a single published
 * props type, exactly as this package is.
 *
 * ## The two keys that do NOT come along, and their separate exits
 *
 *   - `calendar` is declared by NO face of this repo, while
 *     `@objectstack/spec`'s `ComponentPropsMap['object-calendar']` declares it
 *     as the configuration container AND this package's registration `inputs`
 *     publishes it AND `getCalendarConfig` reads it FIRST. Triage's ruling for
 *     the family (objectui#8327, comment `5619610246`) makes that exit
 *     mechanical: declared in spec ⇒ align the mirror. Declared here.
 *   - `dateField` / `endField` were ROUTED TO THE PRODUCER by this card and are
 *     now RETIRED by objectui#8355 (director seat, 2026-09-16). The routing
 *     reading stays recorded because it is the transferable part.
 *     ⛔ An earlier cut of this card retired them on a census that was FALSE.
 *     It said: zero producers write either spelling onto a calendar node. It
 *     could not see the producer because the producer does not write the key
 *     LITERALLY — `plugin-list/src/ListView.tsx`'s `case 'calendar':` SPREAD
 *     the authored block flat onto the node it emits, objectui's own published
 *     `ListViewSchema` accepted `calendar.dateField`, and
 *     `resolveTimelineDateBinding` in that file documents it as *"the pre-#2231
 *     alias for `startDateField`"* and honours it. A word-boundary text census
 *     is structurally blind to a key arriving through a spread. Measured by
 *     mounting the producer: `calendar: { dateField, titleField }` emitted a
 *     node with a flat `dateField` and NO `startDateField`, which the merge-base
 *     drew and the retiring tree refused — SILENTLY, at a generic screen naming
 *     the canonical keys and not the key the author wrote.
 *     ⭐ objectui#8355 retires them anyway, and what makes that legitimate is
 *     the half the failed cut lacked: `@object-ui/types` now REFUSES both
 *     spellings BY NAME on every calendar surface, so the same document fails
 *     loudly at the authoring door instead of drawing nothing. The rungs, the
 *     producer's two raw spreads and these ledger rows all move together; the
 *     rows below are the inverted form of the ones that guarded the routing.
 *
 * ## ⛔ `navigation` is NOT ruled here, and its verdict is INVARIANT
 *
 * objectui#8652 carries the `navigation` family; the maintainer ruled B
 * (declare on the platform element schemas first, then mirror), the spec half
 * is objectstack#17987, and #8652 is `pm:blocked` on it. This card must not
 * rule, declare, retire or touch it.
 *
 * ⭐ It does not, and that is measurable rather than asserted: through the
 * UNION the key was already undeclared, and on `ObjectCalendarSchema` it is
 * undeclared too. ⚠️ The rule is NOT "declared on every arm" — the reading
 * recorded at the top of this file carries five keys on the union that only ONE
 * arm declares (`colorField` `dateField` `defaultView` `endField` `titleField`).
 * It is: a union member is available only when EVERY arm supplies it — by its
 * own declaration OR through an applicable index signature. `ObjectGridSchema`
 * declares `navigation`; `CalendarSchema` neither declares it nor has an index
 * signature to supply it; so the union does not carry it. Same
 * verdict at the read site before and after; the read itself is untouched. It
 * is ledgered BY NAME below, with an assertion that it is STILL READ — a stale
 * exception is a hole (the objectui#8885 ledger discipline).
 *
 * ## What the population assertion is, and why it is not a written-down list
 *
 * AGENTS.md #9: a claim that needs a live population is defended by an
 * instrument that re-derives it every run, never by a figure in prose. So the
 * central row below takes BOTH sides from the tree at run time — the keys read
 * come from a cast-aware census over `ObjectCalendar.tsx` (objectui#6576's
 * `schemaReads`, comment-masked so a key that appears only in prose cannot
 * move a verdict), and the keys declared come from the zod mirror's own
 * `.shape`, never from parse acceptance, which under `.passthrough()` cannot
 * tell "declared" from "admitted unexamined" (objectui#8466's instrument).
 *
 * The TS face is held to the same set by the standing `zod-mirror-parity`
 * ratchet plus the compile-time pins in this file, so one row covers both
 * published faces without this file re-implementing a second checker.
 *
 * ## The ceiling, stated rather than assumed (objectui#5155 / #7927)
 *
 * `BaseSchema` ends in `[key: string]: any` and its mirror is `.passthrough()`,
 * so declaring a key buys VALUE validation and never buys rejection of a
 * MISSPELLING. The counter-probe below pins that honestly, so nobody reads this
 * file as claiming more than it does.

 * is STRICT and declares exactly nine flat members — `calendar` `data`
 * `defaultView` `filter` `loading` `locale` `objectName` `sort` `staticData` —
 * so it refuses every undeclared flat key with the same `unrecognized_keys`

 * `endDateField` `titleField` `colorField` `allDayField`). ⛔ Blanket strictness cannot be the reason these
 * two stay undeclared — applied as a reason it would require undeclaring those
 * canonical five, and this repo's mirror being stricter than the protocol is
 * the SANCTIONED direction anyway (see `zod/objectql.zod.ts`).
 *
 * The real ground was narrower: they are deprecated pre-#2231 ALIASES of keys
 * this schema already declares, and the alias question had an open carrier —
 * objectui#8355 — which had not ruled. It has now: retire at both faces, with

 * LONGER READ, to be DECLARED AS A REFUSAL rather than absent, and the PRODUCER
 * is asserted to no longer flatten either spelling onto the node.

 * forbidden — it would accept what the platform refuses (option D, refused by
 * the same ruling). A refusal arm is the opposite move: the key is declared so
 * that it can be REJECTED by name instead of riding a `.passthrough()`.

/**
 * ⭐ THE REGRESSION ROW, INVERTED BY objectui#8355 — and the inversion is the
 * whole record of why the first attempt was wrong and this one is not.
 *
 * An earlier cut of objectui#8651 retired the two alias rungs and this suite was
 * GREEN, the whole farm was GREEN, and a live authoring path had stopped
 * rendering. What was missing was not a stricter assertion anywhere in it — it
 * was THIS node, and what made its failure UNREPORTABLE was that nothing refused
 * the key: the document validated, the alias arrived, nothing read it, and the
 * author met a generic screen naming keys they had not written.
 *
 * The node below is not invented: it is what `ListView` used to emit for a view
 * authored `calendar: { dateField, titleField }` — captured by mounting the
 * producer with a spy registration — a flat `dateField`, a `titleField`, and NO
 * `startDateField`.
 *
 * ⭐ TWO THINGS CHANGED TOGETHER, which is the ruled shape:
 *
 *   1. the producer no longer emits this node at all (pinned in `plugin-list`'s
 *      `ListView.calendarAliasRefused-8355.test.tsx`), and
 *   2. a document that authors the alias is REFUSED BY NAME at validation,
 *      pointed at `startDateField` / `endDateField` (pinned in section 4 above
 *      and in `@object-ui/types`' `calendar-date-alias-refusal-8355.test.ts`).
 *
 * ⇒ this node reaching the refusal screen is now the CORRECT outcome rather
 * than the regression, because the author has already been told, by name, at
 * the door. ⛔ Do not restore a rung to make this row draw again: that reopens
 * the alias the ruling retired. The row that reports a half-landed retirement
 * is the producer row in section 4 — if the rungs came back while the refusals
 * stayed, section 4's first row reddens.
