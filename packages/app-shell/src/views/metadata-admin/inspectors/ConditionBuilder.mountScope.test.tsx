/**
 * `ConditionBuilder`'s raw CEL editor must lint in the scope its MOUNT SITE
 * evaluates in — objectui#8167, the objectui#7727 defect at a component
 * objectui#7727 does not touch.
 *
 * ## The defect these cases reproduce
 *
 * The scope was not a prop at all. Every mount fell through to `celAuthoring`'s
 * own default — spelled `hint.scope ?? 'flattened'` — and nothing could
 * override it, so a bare `status == 'done'` typed into an action's **Visible
 * when** linted CLEAN. It never matches: `usePredicateRecordContext` binds
 * `record` and nothing else, and objectui#5741 Phase 2 retired the bare
 * shorthand on runtime record surfaces, so the predicate is simply false
 * forever with no author-time signal anywhere.
 *
 * That is why the red leg below types a BARE SHORTHAND and asserts the editor
 * rejects it, rather than asserting that a prop arrived. A "the prop is
 * forwarded" assertion would pass against a scope value that means nothing to
 * the engine; this one can only pass if the engine was actually asked the
 * record-scoped question.
 *
 * ## Real engine, on purpose
 *
 * These cases run against the REAL `@objectstack/formula` — the same choice
 * `ConditionalFormattingEditor.test.tsx` made when PR #8164 turned this same
 * defect at the conditional-formatting mount. A stub would let the suite stay
 * green while asking the engine the wrong question, which is precisely the
 * failure being pinned. Measured on the installed engine, both directions:
 *
 *   scope 'flattened' · `status == 'done'`        -> ok, no findings
 *   scope 'record'    · `status == 'done'`        -> error, names `record.status`
 *   scope 'record'    · `record.status == 'done'` -> ok, no findings
 *
 * ## The control half
 *
 * "Unchanged" is the load-bearing half of the ruling on objectui#8167, so the
 * default itself is pinned: a bare `ConditionBuilder` with no `scope` must
 * still lint the bare shorthand CLEAN. If a later change makes the prop default
 * to `'record'` — or derives it from `subjects.fieldPrefix` — that case goes
 * red, which is the point.
 *
 * ⚠️ `HookDefaultInspector` used to stand beside it as a second control, on the
 * ground that its tier was unsettled. It is settled now (ruling of
 * 2026-09-16), so the same mount appears BELOW as a rejecting case instead.
 * That is a re-homing, not a weakened pin: the control asserted "no claim is
 * made here", and a claim is now made.
 *
 * ## Two mounts still pass nothing, for two DIFFERENT reasons
 *
 *  - the schema-driven `ConditionWidget` in `widgets.tsx` — undecided channel,
 *    no rendered harness of its own, and no JSX mount site to supply a prop;
 *  - the PAGE BLOCK — decided, and the decision is that neither scope fits.
 *    Its evaluator binds `record`, `current_user` AND `page.<var>`, and the
 *    `record` scope REFUSES the third, because `page` is not among the engine's
 *    scope roots. The case below is the falsifiable half of that: it pins the
 *    spec's own documented example, so anyone who "settles" that mount with
 *    `'record'` gets a red test instead of a designer whose Save button is
 *    disabled by a predicate the spec prescribes.
