/**
 * A record form may NOT be saved while an upload is still in flight
 * (objectui#10166).
 *
 * ## What is pinned here, and why it is a DIFFERENTIAL
 *
 * The defect is not an error — it is a success. A `file`/`image` value only
 * becomes its fileId once the presigned upload settles, so a Save pressed
 * during that window wrote the record WITHOUT the attachment and reported
 * success. Nothing threw, nothing warned, and the record looked saved.
 *
 * ⛔ A pin that asserts "no error" therefore passes on exactly the defect, and
 * so does one that asserts the mid-upload Save produced no attachment — that is
 * the defect's own behaviour. These rows compare the SAME save gesture at two
 * timings and assert the STORED VALUE at each:
 *
 *   - issued while the upload is pending → nothing is written at all;
 *   - issued after it resolves           → the record is written WITH the fileId.
 *
 * Each row asserts the stored value FIRST, before any affordance, so it fails
 * on the WRITE rather than on a missing label. And each closes on the invariant
 * no weakening can satisfy on the defect: exactly one record reached the
 * adapter across both gestures, and it carries the file the user picked.
 *
 * ## What is real here and what is faked
 *
 * Only the upload TRANSPORT is faked. The stub widget drives the real
 * `useUploadingSignal` from `@object-ui/fields`, so the signal path under test
 * is the shipping one: `useUploadingSignal` → `UploadingScope` →
 * the host's gate. Faking the transport is what makes the mid-upload window
 * deterministic; `ActionParamDialog.uploading.test.tsx` fakes it the same way
 * for the one host that already had a gate.
