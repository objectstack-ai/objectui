 * a currency in the table must read as a currency in the record drawer. These
 * helpers centralize that logic so the two surfaces never drift:
 *
 * - {@link indexObjectFields} normalizes an object schema's `fields` (array or
 *   map form) into a `name → def` lookup.
 * - {@link buildFieldMeta} derives the `FieldMeta` consumed by the shared
 *   `@object-ui/fields` cell renderers from an object-schema field definition
 *   (with optional per-column overrides + translated select options).
 * - {@link renderFieldValue} turns a raw value + `FieldMeta` into a React node
 *   using the same currency / percent / date / cell-renderer rules as the grid.

/**
 * Relational keys copied from the OBJECT SCHEMA field def onto the built
 * {@link FieldMeta}, so a lookup / master_detail / tree cell can resolve the
 * record it references (objectui#6694).
 *
 * ## What was broken
 *
 * `LookupCellRenderer` (`@object-ui/fields`) resolves its target from
 * `field.reference_to || field.reference` and its display field from
 * `field.display_field`. `FieldMeta` carried NONE of those spellings, so for
 * every lookup cell in `ObjectDataTable` and `RecordDetailDrawer` the renderer
 * resolved `undefined` and two things failed silently: `useRefObjectSchema`
 * never loaded the referenced object's schema (so the ADR-0079 / issue #2357
 * resolution never ran and the cell fell back to `pickRecordDisplayName`'s
 * generic `.name`/`.title` heuristic), and `ReferencedRecordLink`'s `objectName`
 * was always `undefined` (so `navigable` was always `false` and the cell never
 * rendered a real anchor — no drill-through, no middle-click, no copy-link).
 *
 * ## This is ADOPTED, not invented
 *
 * `plugin-grid`'s `ObjectGrid` already makes this exact copy —
 * `applyRelationalMeta`, off its `RELATIONAL_META_KEYS`, at all three of its
 * column-building call sites — which is why its lookup cells have always had
 * both behaviours. This is that same move, made once in the seam BOTH dashboard
 * widgets funnel through, which is what this module exists for (see the file
 * header: the two surfaces must never drift).
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The copy set is DELIBERATELY 3 of the grid's 7 — measured, per key
 *
 * `RELATIONAL_META_KEYS` is `reference_to`, `reference`, `display_field`,
 * `id_field`, `description_field`, `lookup_filters`, `lookupFilters`. It listed
 * NINE until the two keys this file had already measured as reader-less were
 * retired from it as well — `reference_to_field` (objectui#6711) and
 * `titleFormat` (objectui#6874).
 *
 * The grid needs the remaining seven because its cells are
 * EDITABLE — its own docblock says the extra keys "drive the inline picker's
 * query (LookupField reads reference_to/reference, display_field, id_field,
 * description_field, lookup_filters)", and the defect that earned them was an
 * inline-edited lookup showing a raw id.
 *
 * These two widgets are READ-ONLY. Their only render path is
 * {@link renderFieldValue} → `getCellRenderer` → a CELL renderer; no field
 * EDITOR is reachable from it. Measured on `packages/fields/src/index.tsx` —
 * the module `getCellRenderer` dispatches into — the complete set of relational
 * keys read off a cell's `field` prop is:
 *
 *  - `reference_to`, `reference`, `display_field`, `displayField` — read by
 *    `LookupCellRenderer` itself. ✅ COPIED.
 *
 *    ⭐ `displayField` ARRIVED with objectui#6875. The enumeration above used
 *    to name three keys, because it was written from the FIRST leg of each
 *    chain rather than from the whole chain: `LookupCellRenderer` resolves the
 *    display pointer as `display_field || displayField || reference_field`, and
 *    the two extra spellings in that one chain were missed here and in the
 *    grid's own list at the same time. `displayField` is the spelling
 *    `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0's strict `FieldSchema` DECLARES — so on a live
 *    path served through `getObjectSchema` it is the only one that can arrive,
 *    and a lookup cell here rendered the referenced record's generic `.name`
 *    instead of the author's pointer. The grid's twin of this defect is pinned
 *    behaviourally in `plugin-grid/src/__tests__/lookupDisplayFieldSpelling-6875.test.tsx`.
 *
 *  - `reference_field` — the chain's third leg, and still ⛔ NOT copied.
 *    `FieldSchema` does not declare it (it parses to `unrecognized_keys`) and
 *    the producer repo has zero occurrences of the identifier, against a
 *    `displayField` control that hits 68 files. Copying it would write a member
 *    from the def on every call that no producer can fill — objectui#6711's
 *    reasoning, unchanged.
 *  - `id_field`, `description_field`, `lookup_filters`, `lookupFilters` — ZERO
 *    mentions in that module; read only by `fields/src/widgets/LookupField.tsx`
 *    and `UserField.tsx`, both EDITORS. ⛔ NOT copied.
 *  - `reference_to_field` — ZERO member reads anywhere in the repo. ⛔ NOT
 *    copied. ⭐ The grid has since retired it from its own list too
 *    (objectui#6711); this measurement is what that retirement acted on.
 *  - `titleFormat` — never read off a FIELD meta at all; every reader takes it
 *    off the OBJECT schema (`getRecordDisplayName` in `@object-ui/core`,
 *    `containers.tsx`). On this path that object schema arrives through
 *    `useRefObjectSchema(reference_to)` — so copying `reference_to` is what
 *    makes `titleFormat` work, and copying `titleFormat` here would reach
 *    nothing. ⛔ NOT copied. ⭐ The grid has since retired it too
 *    (objectui#6874), on exactly this reading.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not "restore parity" by widening this to the grid's seven. A member
 * written from the schema def on every call and read by nothing is exactly what
 * objectui#6625 (`decimals`) and objectui#6597 (`referenceTo`) retired from this
 * very file. Add a key when a reader on THIS path is measured, not before; if
 * these widgets ever gain inline editing, that is the event that earns the
 * picker keys. The boundary is pinned in
 * `__tests__/lookupRelationalMeta-6694.test.tsx`.

 * The override vocabulary this package's two field surfaces share.
 *
 * ⚠️ This type is a DERIVATION SOURCE, not only a shape: `ObjectDataTable`'s

 * write-side tombstones (objectui#6373) and `AuthoredColumnOverrides`' read-side
 * refusal band (objectui#6425). So a member REMOVED here silently leaves both
 * bands, and any refusal that rode on its membership stops enforcing with
 * nothing going red. A member being retired must therefore be re-refused
 * explicitly at that seam before it leaves this type — see
 * `ObjectDataTableRetiredDecimalsTombstone` in `ObjectDataTable.tsx`, which is
 * what `decimals` left behind.
 *
 * ⛔ `decimals` was RETIRED from this type by objectui#6625 — written from the
 * schema def on every call and read by nothing (zero `.decimals` member reads
 * across `@object-ui/fields`, `@object-ui/i18n`, `@object-ui/components`,
 * `@object-ui/core` and this package, measured against a `.scale` positive
 * control that hits `NumberField.tsx` / `GridField.tsx` / `index.tsx`). If a
 * reader is ever wanted here it reads `scale` — the field def's decimal-places
 * key, which is what the retired write resolved to anyway and what
 * `NumberCellRenderer` already reads (`precision` is the total digit count, a
 * different question — objectui#2131). ⛔ Do not resurrect `decimals`.
 *
 * ⛔ `referenceTo` was RETIRED from this type by objectui#6597 (enforce-or-remove,
 * withdraw branch — maintainer's standing startup-stage rule, 2026-08-27: no
 * measured demand retires immediately). It was documented by this package's
 * README as an author-facing column override, but the promise was never kept:
 * `LookupCellRenderer` (`@object-ui/fields`) resolves its lookup target from
 * `field.reference_to` / `field.reference` — never `field.referenceTo` — and
 * `computeLookupExpand` (`ObjectDataTable.tsx`) builds `$expand` from the OBJECT
 * SCHEMA's field types, never from an authored override. Measured with the
 * `referenceTo`-vs-`options` positive control in
 * `ObjectDataTable.overrideSource-6425.test.tsx`: `options` (a live override)
 * separates two equal-valued columns, `referenceTo` does not — an authored
 * override renders byte-identical to its absence. No authoring story survived
 * the search either: the sibling `ObjectGrid` producer's own relational-meta
 * pass-through (`applyRelationalMeta`, `plugin-grid/src/ObjectGrid.tsx`) copies
 * `reference_to` / `reference` from the SCHEMA field def only, never from an
 * authored column override, and no example/doc/fixture in this repo shows a
 * table column pinning a lookup's target to something other than what its
 * schema field already says. If a reader for the resolved reference target is
 * ever wanted here, it reads `reference_to` / `reference` off the schema field
 * def directly — the spelling `LookupCellRenderer` and `computeLookupExpand`
 * actually use. ⛔ Do not resurrect `referenceTo`.
 *
 * ⭐ That reader ARRIVED (objectui#6694): `reference_to` / `reference` /
 * `display_field` below, copied from the SCHEMA field def by
 * {@link buildFieldMeta} and justified per key on `CELL_RELATIONAL_META_KEYS`.
 * They are the "future reader" both retirement notes predicted, in the spelling
 * they named, and they change neither verdict — the source is the schema field
 * def, never an authored column override, which is the exact distinction
 * objectui#6597 measured and withdrew on.
 *
 * ⚠️ Being `FieldMeta` members they GROW both derived bands in
 * `ObjectDataTable.tsx` — `EnrichedColumn`'s emit tombstones and
 * `UnheldFieldMetaOverrideKey`'s read-side refusal. That is the intended
 * verdict rather than a side effect: an AUTHORED column may not source a
 * lookup's reference target (objectui#6597 measured no authoring story for
 * one), while the schema-derived write is reached by neither band. They landed
 * in both without anyone editing a list — the property this derivation exists
 * for.

 * Whether a field is a relation/lookup (used to drive `$expand`).
 *
 * THE GATE (objectui#4914, ruling B) runs ahead of the membership test.
 * Measured before the ruling: `isLookupType('owner')` was `true` — a retired
 * spelling holding first-class relation status. It answers `false` now, and
 * says why once.
 *
 * The membership half is no longer a private table (objectui#5692). It used to
 * be `new Set(['lookup', 'reference', 'master_detail', 'user'])`, one of TWO
 * copies this package held — the other inline in `computeLookupExpand` — and
 * neither derived from nor pinned against {@link EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES}, the
 * family `@object-ui/core` publishes for exactly this question. objectui#5312's
 * claim to have converted "the LAST private copy" was false by these two: they
 * predate that sweep and were outside its file surface.
 *
 * The convergence moved membership in two directions, each decided by
 * measurement rather than by preference (objectui#5692):
 *
 *  - `tree` is GAINED. A self-referencing hierarchy field is reference-bearing,
 *    it is a member of the spec's closed `FieldType`, and the form / grid road
 *    already `$expand`s it. The dashboard road giving it the same treatment is
 *    family behaviour restored, not a new decision.
 *  - `reference` is DROPPED, and dropping it is a no-op on spec-compliant data.
 *    The spelling is absent from `@objectstack/spec`'s closed `FieldType`
 *    vocabulary and is refused by `FieldSchema.safeParse` — measured with
 *    `lookup` / `master_detail` / `user` / `tree` as live controls and the
 *    retired `owner` plus a nonsense spelling as dead ones — so no
 *    spec-compliant object schema can declare a field whose stored type is
 *    `reference`. Where the spelling IS live it is a legacy DIALECT alias on the
 *    action-param surface, folded to `lookup` before any field-type data is read
 *    (`PARAM_TYPE_ALIASES` in `app-shell/src/utils/paramToField.ts`). Keeping it
 *    here would be a lenient renderer-side alias for off-spec metadata, which is
 *    what AGENTS.md #0.1 bans.
 *
 * Extending this surface later: OR in a second, surface-local set, the way the
 * object form's `needsDataSourceWiring` does. Never
 * `new Set([...EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES, …])` — a copy re-forks the table, which
 * is the defect this change removed, and the identity pin fails on it by design.
