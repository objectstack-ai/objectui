/**
 * The `perm` and `home` namespaces — objectui#3546 slice six — resolve **from
 * the locale packs, with a provider mounted**.
 *
 * ## What was broken, precisely
 *
 * `scripts/check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` (#3530's gate) measured **14 distinct
 * keys at 14 call sites** under `perm.*` / `home.*` that a `t()` call site asks
 * for and that NO pack defined. 1:1, no multi-site key, and **no**
 * `missing-prefix` family belongs to these namespaces — the two that remain in
 * the ratchet (`gantt.linkEnd.`, `organization.invitations.status.`) are later
 * slices'. Measured, never hand-counted: slice two predicted 90 and the truth
 * was 93.
 *
 * Two files own all 14:
 *
 *   - `PermissionFacetLink.tsx` — the read-only summary + "Design in Studio →"
 *     deep-link a `sys_permission_set` record shows for its authorization facets
 *     (ADR-0056 P1). 9 keys.
 *   - `usePublishAllDrafts.ts` — the rest of the publish-everything toasts
 *     (ADR-0038 L3 probe health, seed health, the ADR-0066 ⑨ capability lint).
 *     5 keys, shared by Home's pending-drafts banner and the draft preview bar.
 *
 * All 14 carried an inline `t(key, { defaultValue: … })`, so with a provider
 * mounted this is the milder objectui#3517 class: English rendered and all ten
 * languages were stuck on it. Consequence for test design, as in slices two
 * through five: **`en` output was already correct before the change**, so an
 * `en` assertion cannot discriminate before from after. Every assertion that
 * pins the fix is a non-`en` one; the `en` cases prove reachability and prove
 * the wording did not move.
 *
 * ## The four plural families, and why the base key is not redundant
 *
 * Four of the nine `perm` call sites pluralise English INSIDE the template
 * literal, e.g. `` `${count} object${count === 1 ? '' : 's'}` ``. A byte compare
 * against that is structurally impossible (slice five hit the same wall on
 * `marketplace.org.installed`), and the equivalence pinned instead is stronger:
 * **the template's own output, count by count, equals what the pack renders.**
 *
 * That needs two English forms, so these four keys are i18next plural families.
 * The shape used is `key` + `key_one`, NOT the conventional `key_one` +
 * `key_other`, and the reason is measured behaviour rather than taste:
 *
 *   i18next asks `Intl.PluralRules` for the ONE suffix a language needs for that
 *   count, and if the pack lacks it, moves down the fallback chain to `en` —
 *   which renders ENGLISH. With `_one`/`_other` only, `ru` (few: 2-4, many:
 *   5-20) and `ar` (two, few: 3-10, many: 11-99) would show English at exactly
 *   the counts a user meets first. A pack that also defines the BASE key gets
 *   that key for every category it did not enumerate — in its own language.
 *
 * `detail.showEmptyRelated_one`/`_other` (the repo's one older plural family)
 * has no base key and therefore has that leak today; it is filed, not fixed
 * here — it belongs to the `detail` debt a later slice owns.
 *
 * ## Why a provider is mounted
 *
 * `usePublishAllDrafts` receives `t` from a bare `useObjectTranslation()` (Home
 * and the draft bar both pass it in), so i18next is the thing answering.
 * `PermissionFacetLink` binds `useDetailTranslation`, which is
 * `createSafeTranslation(DETAIL_DEFAULT_TRANSLATIONS, …)`: with a provider it
 * hands over i18next's `t`, and that is the console's path. Its defaults map has
 * no `perm.facet.*` entry, so the provider-LESS path returns the raw key —
 * `fallbackT` reads `defaults[key] || key` and never looks at the call site's
 * inline `defaultValue`. That is a separate defect from this slice's (measured:
 * 16 distinct keys reached through that hook are absent from its 146-entry map,
 * 4 of them keys the packs already resolve); it is filed, and the assertions
 * below deliberately describe the provider path, which is the one the console
 * mounts.
