/**
 * The guide's Data Context passages teach a wiring that RESOLVES (objectui#8021).
 *
 * ## The two independent errors this file holds apart
 *
 * `SchemaRendererProps` declares exactly ONE prop, `schema`
 * (`packages/react/src/SchemaRenderer.tsx`). The docblock beside it names the
 * mechanism: the renderer "passes every prop it does not itself read straight
 * through to the component the schema names". So a `data={…}` or `scope={…}`
 * written on a `SchemaRenderer` element is not ignored and does not warn — it
 * is FORWARDED, and the evaluator never sees it.
 *
 * The evaluator's scope is `usePredicateScope()` plus `current_user`, an
 * optional `record` and `page: pageVariables`. So a host's own values are
 * reachable under whatever NAME it published them through
 * `PredicateScopeProvider`, and a `${data.…}` addresses a root the renderer no
 * longer binds at all.
 *
 * Two coordinates, and the page had both wrong. A repair that moves only one
 * leaves it broken, which is why legs B, D and E below are LIT CONTROLS rather
 * than commentary:
 *
 *   | leg | wiring                  | expression            | rendered                |
 *   |-----|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
 *   | A   | what the page teaches   | what the page teaches | must be `Welcome, John!`|
 *   | B   | `scope` prop on element | the page's expression | the raw source text     |
 *   | C   | `PredicateScopeProvider`| `${user.…}`           | `Welcome, John!`        |
 *   | D   | `PredicateScopeProvider`| `${data.user.…}`      | the raw source text     |
 *   | E   | provider `dataSource`   | `${data.user.…}`      | the raw source text     |
 *
 * B proves the prop supplies nothing even when the expression is right; D
 * proves the name matters even when the wiring is right; E is objectui#9308's
 * own coordinate — the ADAPTER seam is not an expression root, so the wiring
 * this page used to teach now renders the characters the author typed. Leg A
 * is not transcribed from the page — it is READ OFF the page on every run, so
 * it can only go green when both coordinates have moved.
 *
 * ## objectui#9308 — what moved here, and why this file had to move with it
 *
 * The maintainer ruling of 2026-09-13 (option B) removed `data: dataSource`
 * from the evaluator scope and pointed `useDataScope` at the scope channel.
 * The teaching this file pins was meaning 2 of that one key — publish page
 * values through `dataSource`, read them back under `data.*` — so the pages
 * moved and this pin was RE-DERIVED to the new teaching rather than relaxed.
 * Leg C's wiring and leg D's expression are the two halves that swapped; leg E
 * is new and is the direct pin on the removal.
 *
 * ## Why leg A is derived rather than listed
 *
 * A transcription of the fence is a second copy that drifts, and the anchors on
 * this card already drifted twice before it was dispatched. The wiring half is
 * read from the `## Data Context` fence and the expression half from the
 * `### Accessing Data in Schemas` fence, then RENDERED. Edit either passage
 * back and this file reddens.
 *
 * ⚠️ `content/docs/**` is EXCLUDED from `ci.yml`'s full-run decision on
 * `pull_request`, so a green PR page is not evidence that this file ran on a
 * docs-only edit. It lives in `packages/components` for the same reason
 * `guide-layout-page-buttons-7926.test.tsx` does, and the document is declared
 * in `scripts/markdown-test-inputs.mjs`.
 *
 * Module-scope import of the renderers, not `beforeAll` (AGENTS.md 测试纪律):
 * registering them is an unbounded module load and must not be billed to a
 * bounded hook timeout.
