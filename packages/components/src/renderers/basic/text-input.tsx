 * element:text_input — a single-line free-text input that writes the typed
 * value into a page variable. The data-entry complement to
 * element:record_picker (which picks an existing record): together they let a
 * pure-SDUI page COLLECT input, which a submit button then posts via the action
 * runtime's `{{page.<var>}}` bridge (useConsoleActionRuntime).
 *
 * Config is read off `schema.properties` (`schema.props` tolerated as a legacy
 * alias):
 *   { inputType='text', label?, placeholder?, defaultValue?, required?,
 *     disabled?, description? }
 *
 * The value is written through `usePageVariableBinding(schema.id)`: the page
 * variable whose `source` equals this input's id receives every keystroke. With
 * no bound variable the input is uncontrolled (still usable, just not wired) so
 * it never throws outside a Page — mirroring element:record_picker. An
 * `inputType='number'` coerces the written value to a Number (empty → '') so
 * `page.<var>` and any numeric submit param stay typed.

  // Reusing `schema.id` would have imported the label's dependency for no gain

    // resolve it — the order `ComponentInput.type` prescribes: never declare an
    // arm the renderer drops.
    //
    // Here the render site was NEVER behind. `pickLocalized(props.label,

    // since this renderer was written, so the map has always reached the screen
    // correctly in the viewer's language. Only the declaration stayed at one
    // arm — which is the SAME rule's other half, and `ComponentInput.type`
    // states it in those words: withholding an arm the renderer resolves makes
    // the manifest gate report `type-mismatch` on a legal write, "one platform
    // authority contradicting itself on the write it just recommended".

    //     <element:text_input> prop "description" expected a string

    // verdicts are what
    // `packages/components/src/__tests__/text-input-inputs-spec-parity.test.ts`
    // compares this declaration against, per key, so a spec release that drops
    // an arm and a declaration that grows one the spec rejects are both red.
    // `defaultValue` below deliberately does NOT join this trio — its contract
    // is `string | number` with no object arm, and the console specimen file
    // keeps that separation as the control that makes this widening per-key
    // rather than blanket.

That association does not depend on the node carrying an `id` (`label`’s `htmlFor` does): the id `aria-describedby` needs sits on the paragraph, which the renderer mints per instance, and it is emitted only when a paragraph is actually rendered — an absent or empty `description` leaves the input with no `aria-describedby` at all. Prefer `label` anyway for an instruction a user MUST NOT miss: a description is announced after the field’s name, and screen readers gate description text behind verbosity settings a user can turn down (NVDA’s “Report object descriptions”, VoiceOver hint verbosity), so it is the half of the announcement most likely to go unheard — the same advice as before, now resting on announcement order and verbosity rather than on the text being unwired.',
