/**
 * The drill "escape hatch" and the empty bucket — the THIRD consumer of
 * `buildDatasetDrillFilter`, measured for objectui#9085 and REPAIRED by
 * objectui#9159.
 *
 * `buildDatasetDrillFilter`'s output has three consumers. Two of them
 * (`ObjectDataTable`, and the report drill's `SchemaRenderer` path, which wraps
 * the filter in an `$and`) lower it through `convertFiltersToAST`, where
 * objectui#9085's `{ $null: true }` becomes `['field','is_null',true]` and the
 * empty bucket selects its own rows. This is the third: the host's
 * `openRecordList`, which does NOT go through that converter — it serializes
 * the same object into `filter[...]` URL params for the bare data surface.
 *
 * ## What objectui#9085 measured here, and why it left it open
 *
 * ⚠️ At that time this dialect had NO spelling for is-null. Its whole operator
 * vocabulary was equality plus four range bounds, so there was no param shape
 * carrying "this dimension is empty" and no suffix `parseUrlFilterTriples` would
 * read back as one. `{ $null: true }` and the bare `null` it replaced therefore
 * serialized BYTE-IDENTICALLY, an empty-bucket drill escalated to the list page
 * had always landed on a superset, and objectui#9085 neither improved nor
 * regressed that — which is exactly what this file was written to hold.
 *
 * ## What objectui#9159 changed, and why these assertions moved rather than went
 *
 * That card added the missing operator on BOTH sides of the dialect
 * (`NULL_FILTER` — `filter[<field>][null]=true`), so the claim above has stopped
 * being true, at the assertions the card said it would: the two spellings are no
 * longer byte-identical, and an empty-bucket-only drill no longer serializes to
 * nothing. The claim is UPDATED to the new byte-identity rather than deleted,
 * because what this file is for is recording what the escape hatch does with an
 * empty bucket — first that it dropped it, now that it carries it.
 *
 * ⇒ the surviving record: the bare `null` spelling is STILL not a condition (a
 * producer writes it when it has nothing to say about the field), the RANGE
 * vocabulary is still exactly the four bounds it always was, and the divergence
 * between the two spellings is the repair. The end-to-end obligations of the new
 * operator — the real `openRecordList`, the destination scope, the chip, and the
 * answer for `[null]=false` — live in
 * `drillEmptyBucketEscapeHatch-9159.test.tsx`.
