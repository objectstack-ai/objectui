/**
 * Pull one field's definition out of an object schema, in either served shape.
 *
 * The ARITY VERDICT itself is NOT computed here — it is
 * `@objectstack/spec/data`'s `isMultiValueField`, imported above. This function
 * exists only to find the def to hand it, which is the part the spec cannot do:
 * the spec takes a `ValueShapeFieldDef`, and the metadata API serves a
 * CONTAINER of them in two shapes — the Record keyed by field name, and the
 * array of defs carrying their own `name` (the pair `FieldContainerLike` in
 * `@object-ui/core` names). A reader that knows only one of them silently
 * answers "no such field" for the other, which is this card's own bug spelled
 * as a default.
 *
 * ⛔ Do not reintroduce a local arity rule here, however small. This component
 * decides `$contains` vs `=` on the answer, and a second copy of that rule
 * living here would be two readers of one question inside one package —
 * exactly the defect objectui#7299 is about, rebuilt one layer up. The spec's
 * rule is BROADER than an eyeballed `multiple === true` in both directions:
 * `multiselect` / `checkboxes` / `tags` persist an array with no flag at all,
 * and `multiple: true` is INERT on a type outside `MULTI_CAPABLE_TYPES`
 * (`master_detail`, say). Both are pinned.
 *
 * ## The storage side does NOT read this predicate — the two rules DIVERGE
 *
 * This docblock used to say the driver that refuses the query decides on the
 * spec's `isMultiValueField`. It does not (objectui#8937). Measured on
 * objectstack `origin/main`, `driver-sql` gates the equality family on its own
 * STORAGE question, `isJsonField`: a column is JSON when the field's type is in
 * that driver's `JSON_COLUMN_TYPES` — the spec's `STRUCTURED_JSON_TYPES` and
 * `MULTI_OPTION_TYPES`, plus the driver-internal `object` / `array` aliases —
 * OR when `multiple` is merely TRUTHY, on ANY type; a single-value media type
 * answers from the ADR-0104 dual-encoding window instead. The spec's predicate
 * is `MULTI_OPTION_TYPES.has(type) || (MULTI_CAPABLE_TYPES.has(type) &&
 * multiple === true)`.
 *
 * ⇒ They diverge for a type OUTSIDE `MULTI_CAPABLE_TYPES` carrying
 * `multiple: true` (`master_detail` / `tree` / `text`): the spec says
 * single-valued, so this component sends `=`, while the driver stores a JSON
 * column and refuses `=` with the same `400 INVALID_FILTER` objectui#7299 was
 * filed for. That is a KNOWN divergence, not a regression — the pre-objectui#8886
 * renderer sent `=` for that shape too.
 *
 * ⛔ Do NOT close it here by widening the predicate: which of the two rules is
 * right is an upstream question, filed as objectstack#17469 (enforce-or-align),
 * and this component is deliberately not blocked on it. The divergence is
 * re-derived from the installed spec each run by
 * `relatedListParentScopeResidue-8937.test.ts`, so this paragraph reddens when
 * the spec side moves.

     * Does this cell have nothing to show? **THE** definition of emptiness on
     * this surface (objectui#8459), read by BOTH places that decide what the
     * reader sees:
     *
     *  - `pruneEmpty`, which drops a COLUMN whose every cell is empty;
     *  - the placeholder branch of `makeCell`, which draws the muted em-dash
     *    for an individual CELL.
     *
     * The two MUST agree, because one is defined in terms of the other:
     * `pruneEmpty` keeps a column when `.some()` cell is not empty, and that
     * promise ("a column you can see has something in it") is only true when
     * "empty" means the same thing as "this cell draws the placeholder".
     * They did not agree. The cell branch tested `null | undefined` alone, so
     * the two clauses below that it lacked — whitespace-only strings and empty
     * arrays — were pruned at the column level and rendered as *visually blank
     * cells* in any column that survived because some other row had a value.
     * Measured in real DOM: a `note` column holding `['   ', 'real']` kept its
     * header and painted the first cell with three spaces, where the very same
     * function draws `—` for `null`.
     *
     * ## Why this does NOT delegate to `DetailSection`'s `hasCellValue`
     *
     * ⚠️ objectui#8496 put the four members BOTH functions share into
     * `@object-ui/core`'s `isEmptyValue` and had each call it. That is a shared
     * FLOOR, not a merge: this predicate and `hasCellValue` stay two functions
     * on purpose, because a grid COLUMN and a record ROW ask the question at two
     * granularities, and objectui#8459 measured this one as the better-shaped
     * answer here. ⛔ Do not "finish the job" by deleting one of them.
     *
     * Measured, not assumed. `hasCellValue` answers `true` for every non-null
     * `object`, and `typeof [] === 'object'` — so it calls an EMPTY ARRAY a
     * VALUE. This surface calls it empty, and that is the answer a grid needs:
     * `SelectCellRenderer` maps `[]` over zero options and paints nothing, so
     * an all-`[]` column pruned here would instead survive and render a column
     * of blank cells. Delegating would therefore *introduce* the defect this
     * function exists to remove. The two surfaces agree on every scalar (both
     * trim) and on non-empty objects (both VALUE, so type-aware renderers keep
     * drawing coordinates, addresses and badges); they differ only on `[]`,
     * and here the finer line is the right one.
     *
     * `0` and `false` are VALUES on both — no clause below matches them.
     *
     * Pinned end-to-end (DOM, not predicate) in

   * They never shared a derivation before, which is how the same refused sort
   * stayed reachable through whichever control the other one did not cover.
   *
   * TWO reasons, kept separate on purpose — the same split the grid header
   * makes (`ObjectGrid.withSortability`, #5729):
   *
   *  - RELATIONAL, and deliberately NOT delegated to the platform signal. The
   *    projection answers `sortable: true` for a `lookup`: the platform's
   *    question is whether it can order by the STORED foreign key, which it
   *    can. Ours is whether that order means anything next to a column of
   *    related-record names, and it does not (objectstack#4256 settled that no
   *    relation join is coming). Two different questions; folding this one into
   *    the signal would hand every relational column its sort back.
   *  - PLATFORM. `isPlatformSortableField` is the contract: an entry must EXIST
   *    in the served projection and say `sortable: true`. Absence is a refusal
   *    — an unknown name, a dotted path (a caller may hand `columns` either),
   *    an unprovisioned audit column — never a default of `true`.
   *
   * Both entry points used to read `isUnmaterializedFieldType` off the field's
   * TYPE instead. That agrees with the projection about `formula` — the
   * platform computes its own from the same `@objectstack/spec` storage fact —
   * which is exactly why the drift went unnoticed. It parts company on
   * everything the projection encodes as ABSENCE, and on any verdict the
   * runtime doors add later; and it cannot follow the platform when it moves.
   *
   * NO SIGNAL SERVED keeps the type read as a compatibility floor: behaviour
   * identical to before this card, unreachable the moment a backend serves the
   * signal, and meant to be deleted when the supported floor passes that
   * release.

   * of column cannot survive that trip (objectui#3096, #3950):

   *  - a relational column stores a foreign-key id, so "sort by Owner" would
