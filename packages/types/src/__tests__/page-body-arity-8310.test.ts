 * `PageNodeSchema`'s flat content list admits ONE node or a list of them — on
 * both faces (objectui#8310, maintainer ruling 2026-09-07, director decision
 * batch #2).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE KEY MOVED, THE RULING DID NOT. objectui#8310 was decided about the
 * `body` spelling, which was this node's flat content list at the time.
 * objectui#6771 retired that spelling across the protocol; `FlatContent` now
 * reads `schema.children` and nothing else, so the arity ruling governs
 * `children` and every assertion below was moved onto it. The last block in
 * this file is the other half: `body` is refused by name on both faces, so a
 * page still written in the retired spelling is answered rather than silently
 * rendered empty. Read the two together — the arity survives, the spelling did
 * not.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins closed
 *
 * The base declares this channel `SchemaNode | SchemaNode[]`. `PageNodeSchema`
 * inherited it and NARROWED it to `SchemaNode[]`, while the only reader of the
 * channel — `FlatContent`, the flat fallback inside
 * `PageRenderer` (`packages/components/src/renderers/layout/page.tsx`) — went on
 * accepting a bare node, normalizing it into a one-element list behind a
 * `content as SchemaNode` cast. The cast was the marker: the branch was
 * unreachable through the renderer's own declared props, and existed only
 * because the declaration forbade a value the renderer draws.
 *
 * The refused shape is not hypothetical. It is what this project's own landing
 * page teaches: the root `README.md` "Basic Usage" example gives `body` a
 * single `grid` node. That snippet type-checked only because
 * `SchemaRendererProps.schema` is annotated `BaseSchema` — the WIDER parent —
 * so nothing on the authoring path ever asked this key about its arity. An
 * author who reached for the PRECISE type (the shape a contract-first host
 * wants, and the type `PageRenderer`'s own props already use) was refused.
 *
 * ## The three legs, and which one is evidence
 *
 * 1. **Type-level (`readmeFlagshipPage`) — the discriminating leg.** This
 *    object is a transcription of the README fence, annotated `PageNodeSchema`.
 *    `packages/types`' `type-check` script compiles this file
 *    (`tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`), so re-narrowing `body` to `SchemaNode[]`
 *    stops it compiling. Before the widening it did not compile — that failure
 *    IS the card.
 * 2. **Runtime (`safeParse` of the same value) — also discriminating.** The zod
 *    mirror carried the identical narrowing (`z.array(SchemaNodeSchema)`), so
 *    the single-node form was refused by the validator too. Both faces moved,
 *    and this leg is what catches a half-repair that fixes only the TS side.
 * 3. **The array form — a CONTROL, not evidence.** It was legal before and is
 *    legal after, on both faces. It is here so a later change that breaks the
 *    list arity while "fixing" the single one cannot pass; it proves nothing
 *    about this card on its own, and is labelled so it is never read that way.
 *
 * The README-scan leg keeps leg 1 honest. The ruling requires the flagship
 * example to STAY AS WRITTEN and be pinned legal against the declared type —
 * so "repairing" the README into the array form (which would hide the defect
 * inside a green) reddens this file instead of passing silently.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The ceiling, measured — do not read this pin as more than it is
 *
 * `BaseSchema` carries `[key: string]: any`. Annotating an authored page
 * therefore catches a value of the WRONG TYPE and never a MISSPELLED KEY: an
 * undeclared key is absorbed by the index signature and draws zero
 * diagnostics, while a type-wrong value draws TS2322. This card repairs the
 * arity of one declared key; it does not turn `PageNodeSchema` into a closed
 * surface, and nothing here should be quoted as if it did.
 *
 * ⚠️ A second, unrelated defect in the same fence was measured while writing
 * this file and filed as objectui#8912: the flagship grid SPELLED its child
 * list `items`, a key `grid` never reads, so that example drew an EMPTY grid.
 * That card has since repaired all three teaching surfaces to `children`, and
 * the transcription below follows the repaired flagship. This file still asks
 * only about `body`'s ARITY and rules on nothing else; the child key is pinned
 * by the render pin in
 * `packages/components/src/__tests__/page-body-single-node-8310.test.tsx`.

 * REFUSAL CONTROL — what the widened `children` must still turn away.

 * Legs 1-3 all assert ACCEPTANCE. A `children` arm that had degraded into

 * of them green, so on their own they measure the widening's DIRECTION and
 * never its BOUND. This block is the missing half. It pins the refusal
 * ENVELOPE — an `invalid_union` issue at path `['children']` — rather than the
 * bare falsity of `success`, so a page refused for some unrelated reason cannot
 * stand in for a `children` that was judged and rejected.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Measured, and it is not what the obvious guess says
 *
 * `children: 42` and `children: 'x'` are **LEGAL**, on both faces, and an assertion
 * that they are refused pins a contract this repo does not have:
 *
 * - `../base.ts`: `type SchemaNode = BaseSchema | string | number | boolean | null | undefined`
 * - `../zod/base.zod.ts`: `nodeUnionOptions = [BaseSchemaCore, z.string(),
 *   z.number(), z.boolean(), z.null(), z.undefined()]`
 *
 * A primitive IS a `SchemaNode` here — the text-node convention — so
 * `SchemaNode | SchemaNode[]` admits `42` by construction, exactly as
 * `BaseSchema.children`, `CardSchema.children` and `AspectRatioSchema.children`
 * already did before this card. ⛔ Do not "harden" this block by asserting a primitive
 * is refused: that assertion is RED today, and if it ever went green it would
 * mean the node union had lost arms it is declared to have.
 *
 * ## Why these three values, and not a bogus `type`
 *
 * `SchemaNodeSchema`'s recursion slot 0 holds `BaseSchemaCore` until
 * `../zod/index.zod.js` has been evaluated and `AnyComponentSchema` from the
 * moment it has (`defineNodeComponentUnion`, `../zod/base.zod.ts`). Measured
 * both ways: `{ type: 'definitely-not-a-node' }` is ACCEPTED in the first world
 * and REFUSED in the second, so it is a function of module evaluation order in
 * the importing file and ⛔ must not be used as a refusal fixture. An object
 * carrying **no `type` at all** is refused in BOTH worlds — `BaseSchemaCore`
 * requires `type`, and a discriminated union cannot dispatch without it — so
 * that is the value this control is built on, in either arity.
