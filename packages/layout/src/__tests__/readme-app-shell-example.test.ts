/**
 * `packages/layout/README.md`'s AppShell examples spell only real props
 * (objectui#4817).
 *
 * The npm landing page for this package taught `<AppShell header={…}>`.
 * `AppShellProps` has never declared `header` — the top bar's entry point is
 * `navbar` — and `AppShell` destructures a FIXED key list with no rest element
 * (`AppShell.tsx:233-241`), so the node was built and dropped on the floor with
 * no warning of any kind. `AppShell` renders the `<header>` element itself
 * (`:248`) and fills it from `{navbar}` (`:249`), so a reader who copied the
 * example verbatim got a shell whose top bar was permanently empty. Two further
 * fences on the same page had the same defect in two more spellings: the
 * "Usage with React Router" example passed `header={…}` too, and "Customization"
 * passed `headerClassName` / `sidebarClassName`, neither of which exists either
 * (there is no per-slot className at all — `className` goes to `<main>`).
 *
 * This is objectui#3999's defect (SidebarNav, same README, pinned by
 * `readme-sidebar-nav-example.test.ts`) and objectui#4793's (SidebarNav on
 * `content/docs/layout/app-shell.mdx`, pinned by
 * `app-shell-docs-nav-example.test.ts`) reproduced on a third teaching surface,
 * which is why this pin is built the same way.
 *
 * ## The halves, and why each is a different kind of fact
 *
 * 1. **Compile-time.** The prop objects below are real `AppShellProps` values
 *    imported from `../AppShell`. `packages/layout`'s `type-check` script
 *    compiles this file (`tsconfig.test.json`), so re-adding `header` — or
 *    `headerClassName` — makes them stop compiling (TS2353 "Object literal may
 *    only specify known properties") instead of silently rendering nothing.
 *    This half catches an undeclared key at the keyboard.
 *
 * 2. **Props-table parity.** The `#### \`AppShellProps\`` table this issue added
 *    to the README is a SECOND surface that can rot exactly the way the example
 *    did, so its keys are not hand-listed here either: the expected list is read
 *    out of `AppShell.tsx`'s interface body on every run. Documenting a key that
 *    does not exist, or adding one to the interface and not the table, is red.
 *    This half asserts KEYS only — that each documented row names a real
 *    authoring prop — which is all a key table can be wrong about.
 *
 * 3. **Whole-section scan.** Parity guards the table; the compile-time half
 *    guards the two objects it declares. A NEW `<AppShell>` example pasted into
 *    the README later would be guarded by neither. So the last two tests re-read
 *    every fence on the page that mentions `AppShell`, collect the props of each
 *    `<AppShell …>` opening tag, and reject any the interface does not declare —
 *    with the expected key list read OUT OF the source, so this can never rot
 *    into "update the test".
 *
 * ## Scan surface — deliberately narrow
 *
 * This file reads `packages/layout/README.md` and `packages/layout/src/AppShell.tsx`,
 * and nothing else. Within that README it judges only the `<AppShell …>` opening
 * tags: the `SidebarNav` section, its props tables and the `<SidebarNav …>` tag
 * nested inside the router example's `sidebar={…}` belong to
 * `readme-sidebar-nav-example.test.ts` (objectui#3999) and are not touched here
 * — which is why `appShellTagProps` walks the tag with brace-depth tracking
 * rather than regexing the fence, so a nested element's props are never
 * collected as AppShell's own. `content/docs/layout/app-shell.mdx` is
 * `app-shell-docs-nav-example.test.ts`'s surface (objectui#4793), and pinning
 * the whole docs tree to source is objectui#3786's problem, not this one.
 *
 * Note also that `@object-ui/app-shell` exports a DIFFERENT props type for its
 * own `AppShell`, `MinimalAppShellProps` (`packages/app-shell/src/types.ts`),
 * which really does declare `header` — that is a separate component, and
 * reading this one's key list off this one's source is what keeps the two from
 * being conflated again. Until objectui#6349 (batch 9) it was also spelled
 * `AppShellProps`.
