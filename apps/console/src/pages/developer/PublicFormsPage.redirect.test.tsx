/**
 * objectui#4990 — the Public Forms dialog is an authoring door for
 * `submitBehavior.url`, so it must refuse what the contract refuses.
 *
 * The ruling is objectstack#7496 (2026-08-11), landed in `@objectstack/spec` by
 * objectstack#7657 and live on this repo's 17.0.0 GA pin: the key is a RELATIVE
 * in-app path, interpolated only as `{{record.field_name}}`. The spec refuses
 * seven families of value, each with its own author-facing prescription. This
 * dialog enforced ONE of them — non-empty — and wrote the other six into view
 * metadata unexamined.
 *
 * ## What is pinned, and against what
 *
 * The oracle is the contract itself. `specRefusal()` below performs the same
 * minimal parse an authoring door performs and reads the message off it, so
 * every expectation here is "the dialog showed the SPEC's sentence", never "the
 * dialog showed this string I typed into a test". That distinction is the whole
 * point of the fix: a local copy of the seven prescriptions would pass a
 * literal-text assertion right up to the spec release that reworded one, which
 * is the drift `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs` exists to discourage.
 * These tests follow the pin instead — reword the spec and they still pass;
 * hand-write the message in the dialog and they fail.
 *
 * The second half of every refusal case is that `meta.saveItem` was NOT called.
 * A dialog that showed the refusal and saved anyway would be the same corpus
 * defect wearing an error's clothes.
 *
 * ## Reverse verification — predicted first, then measured
 *
 * 1. **Reverting the door to the non-empty check** (`if (!editBehaviorUrl)` +
 *    `url: editBehaviorUrl`): all eight out-of-contract cases go RED, and each
 *    fails on BOTH assertions — `saveItem` is called with the rejected value,
 *    and no alert renders to read a message from. The empty case stays GREEN in
 *    its save-blocking half (the old code refused empty too) and goes RED on the
 *    message, because `Redirect URL is required` is not the spec's sentence.
 *    The in-contract cases and the thank-you boundary case stay green.
 * 2. **Keeping the parse but showing a local string** (`setEditUrlRefusal('That
 *    URL is not allowed')`): every refusal case stays green on `saveItem` and
 *    goes RED on the message comparison — the narrow change detector for message
 *    PROVENANCE, which is the property a second copy of the rule would silently
 *    take away.
 *
 * Control characters in the fixtures below are written as escape sequences on
 * purpose — a raw one makes the whole file read as binary to grep, and this repo
 * has paid for that four times (objectui#4890 among them).
