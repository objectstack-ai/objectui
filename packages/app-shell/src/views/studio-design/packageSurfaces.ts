/**
 * Load the rail entries for one metadata type inside a Studio package pillar:
 * the PUBLISHED items unioned with the pending DRAFT items, deduped by name.
 *
 * Why the union: `client.list(type, { packageId })` only returns
 * published/active metadata. A freshly-authored item that hasn't been published
 * yet (or a whole fresh writable-base package whose items are all still drafts)
 * would therefore render an empty rail even though the author just created it —
 * and the "N pending changes" counter would show the draft exists while the rail
 * itself hid it. Merging `client.listDrafts({ packageId, type })` keeps the item
 * designable between authoring and its first publish.
 *
 * This is the canonical form of the merge the Data / Interfaces / Access pillars
 * already do inline; extracting it (a) fixes the Automations pillar, which was
 * the sole rail that listed only published items and hid draft-only flows, and
 * (b) makes the behaviour unit-testable without rendering a heavy pillar tree.
 *
 * Draft headers carry no label (they are light rows — no body), so a draft-only
 * item shows its machine name until the draft body loads on selection, matching
 * the sibling pillars.
