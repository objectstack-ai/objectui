/**
 * Shared building blocks for scoped metadata inspectors.
 *
 * Every inspector renders the same three regions:
 *   • Header strip — kind chip + element label + close button
 *   • Scrollable form area — labelled inputs in a single column
 *   • Footer — destructive "remove this element" button
 *
 * The widgets below factor those regions out so each per-type
 * inspector can stay focused on field definitions and update logic.
 *
 * All inputs are uncontrolled-from-outside: parent owns the draft
 * record, inspectors call `onCommit(value)` which trips an immutable
 * splice + `onPatch({...})`. Locale-aware via the `useT` hook the
 * caller already has in scope — the shared shell takes raw strings.
 *
 * The exceptions are DEFAULTS rather than labels a caller hands in: the flag
 * {@link InspectorSelectField} puts on a stored value its roster does not
 * offer (objectui#9652), and the wording a caller may omit — the shell's close
 * label, the reorder pair's names and the roster-failure notice
 * (objectui#10586). Wherever a call site passes none, the default is what a
 * zh-CN author reads, so it resolves through `useMetadataLocale()` — the hook
 * the designer's other shared editors (`widgets.tsx`, `SchemaForm`,
 * `ConditionBuilder`) already read when no `locale` prop reaches them. A label
 * the caller passes always wins.

  // all: the trigger goes blank, pixel-identical to "unset". The author then
  // sees an empty control, picks something to "fill it in", and overwrites a
  // key they were never shown.
  //
  // ⛔ The placeholder is NOT the repair. Drawing `'—'` here would assert
  // "nothing is stored" about a field that IS storing something — worse than
  // the blank, because it is confidently wrong rather than merely empty. So
  // the two states must stay distinguishable on screen, and they are: empty
  // draws `placeholder`, unknown draws the value itself under a flag.
  //
  // EIGHT call sites had hand-rolled this, and re-deriving them is what moved
  // the rule here. Three flagged the row — `ActionTargetField`
  // ("(not found)"), `ViewColumnInspector`'s field picker ("(not in object)")
  // and `FlowNodeConfigField`'s select branch ("(deprecated)", framework#4278 /
  // ADR-0090 D3). FIVE only made it visible — `ReportDefaultInspector`'s type,
  // dataset and both chart axes, and `ViewVariantInspector`'s type — appending
  // the raw value with no marker at all, which is the same screen a real option
  // draws. Every one of them is deleted now; only the WORDING stays with the
  // call site, through `unknownValueLabel`.
  //
  // The row is selectable — all three flagged copies made it so, and re-picking
  // your own stored value must not be a dead end. It goes FIRST, where two of
  // those three put it: Radix scrolls the selected item into view on open, so
  // the real roster then sits directly under it, which is where a replacement
  // gets picked.
  //
  // objectui#8862 — the boundary objectui#8488 measured and left open, closed
  // here. An `options` array cannot say WHY it is empty: an async picker that
  // has not answered yet hands over `[]`, indistinguishable from a catalog that
  // genuinely does not carry the value. So a perfectly valid stored value wore
  // the flag for the length of a round trip — and on the metadata-AUTHORING
  // surface that flag is not a cosmetic wobble, it is an assertion to the
  // author that a key they bound correctly does not exist on the object. The
  // plausible response is to "fix" a binding that was already right.
  //
  // objectui#8862 gave that boundary a `loading` term and made the answer a
  // TRI-state. objectui#9651 measured the arm it left open and made the answer
  // read ONE state instead of a list plus flags — see {@link rosterVerdict}:
  //   • roster answered, value offered     → the option's own label
  //   • roster answered, value NOT offered → the value under `unknownValueLabel`
  //   • roster unasked or in flight        → the value, bare
  //   • roster FAILED                      → the value, bare, plus a notice
  //
  // The row is still SYNTHESISED in every silent arm. Withholding it would put
  // back the blank trigger objectui#8488 removed, and would blank it exactly
  // when the author has least other evidence of what is stored; only the CLAIM
  // is withheld. A value drawn plainly asserts nothing about a roster that has
  // not spoken, which is the only honest render while it is silent. ⚠️ That is
  // not the direction objectui#8488 refused: what it refused — "stored" and
  // "offered" drawn alike — is a claim about a roster that HAS answered and
  // can tell them apart. This one cannot, and in the failure arm never will.
  //
  // objectui#9651 — the arm objectui#8862 left open, and the reason it needed
  // its own decision rather than a wider `loading`. A fetch that FAILS also
  // leaves `options` at `[]` with nothing in flight, so to a list-plus-flag
  // reading it is byte-identical to "the roster answered and your value is not
  // in it" — and unlike the pending arm it never resolves, so the false claim
  // was PERMANENT. Measured on the unrepaired tree through the real
  // `ViewColumnInspector`: a rejected `client.get` rendered
  // `amount (not in object)` for a field the object really has, with nothing
  // anywhere on screen saying the request failed.
  //
  // ⚠️ Suppressing the flag is only half. A silent suppression trades a wrong
  // message for NO message, and the author is then looking at a picker whose
  // list is empty for an unstated reason. So the failure arm also renders its
  // own notice, carrying the cause — which is what this tree already decided a
  // picker owes its host on a failed catalog: `PickerLoadFailure` in
  // `widgets.tsx` (objectui#5170) states that the list could not be loaded,
  // shows the cause, makes NO claim about whether options exist, and keeps the
  // control editable so a failed catalog does not also block authoring. Same
