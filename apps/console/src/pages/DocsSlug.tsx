/**
 * `/docs/:slug` — resolves a single segment under the portal to either a book
 * landing or a legacy doc permalink (ADR-0046).
 *
 * Books and docs share the `/docs/<segment>` space deliberately: a doc's
 * identity stays single-coordinate (`<name>`, ADR §4) while a book occupies a
 * `slug` portal segment (ADR §6). When the segment is a book slug we render its
 * landing; otherwise we treat it as a flat doc name and redirect to its
 * canonical in-book URL `/docs/<homeBook>/<name>` — every doc has a home book
 * (its package's authored or implicit book, §6.4), so this resolves for any
 * installed doc. An unknown segment degrades to a "not found" notice.
 *
 * A segment that is a book's NAME rather than its slug — what a
 * `{ type: 'doc', book }` navigation entry links to (objectui#11197) — redirects
 * to that book's canonical slug URL. It is looked up only AFTER the two answers
 * that stand today (a book slug, then an installed doc's name), and before the
 * name-prefix fallback, whose redirect for a name no installed doc carries lands
 * on "not found". So nothing that resolves today changes its answer.
 *
 * A segment none of the member's lists answers is asked about ONCE, by name, before
 * that fallback (objectui#10188): a doc or book the member may not read renders the
 * refusal, in place, and a name nothing carries keeps every answer above.
