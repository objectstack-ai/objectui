/**
 * objectui#10002 — the REMEDY half of `warnOnTopLevelStyleUrl`, tied to the
 * spelling the runtime actually reads.
 *
 * That warning is read at the moment the author is ALREADY being corrected, so
 * a remedy it names has to be one the runtime honours; objectui#9031 ruled that
 * for a sibling sink. It named `map: { mapStyle }` — a key
 * `ObjectMapConfigSchema` does not declare, so neither view flattener's
 * whitelist carries it and `getMapConfig` never reads it. An author who obeyed
 * the correction wrote metadata that was dropped a second time, with no second
 * diagnostic.
 *
 * ⛔ WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY IS NOT: a snapshot of the sentence. A string
 * assertion is how the old remedy stayed green while being false — nothing
 * executed it. So the remedy is not compared against a literal here. It is
 * PARSED out of the warning the component really emits, and every key it
 * prescribes inside a `map` block is then WRITTEN into a `map` block and
 * measured end to end:
 *
 *   - through the declared block on a directly authored node, and
 *   - through the real `ListView` flatten, the producer a view author goes
 *     through, into the real `ObjectMap`.
 *
 * ⇒ the two cannot drift apart. Re-spell the remedy and the render measures the
 * new key; change what `getMapConfig` (or either flattener's whitelist) reads,
 * and the remedy that was true stops arriving. Either way this goes red.
 *
 * `@object-ui/plugin-list` is already a devDependency of this package for the
 * same reason `ObjectMap.listViewMapConfigReach.test.tsx` uses it: dev-only,
 * acyclic, and the only home that can mock `react-map-gl` while driving the
 * real producer.
