 * objectui#10035 — a write refreshes the view's DATA; it does not rebuild the
 * view (AGENTS.md #8's corollary).
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `renderContent` keyed every view it rendered on
 * `objectName-view-type-refreshKey`, and `refreshKey` moves on every write
 * this component hears about (`onMutation`, a form save, a delete). So each
 * write REMOUNTED the view: a fresh instance, every piece of component state in
 * it gone. The rows were refetched too — through the remount — which is why
 * nothing looked broken: the damage was the remount, not a missing refetch.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of view, one rule
 *
 * - DATA-FED views (`kanban`, `calendar`, `gallery`, `timeline`, `map`,
 *   `tree`) draw the `data` this component fetches; its non-grid fetch effect
 *   re-reads on `refreshKey`.
 * - SELF-FETCHING views (`gantt`, `chart`, the grid branch) render a component
 *   that queries for itself. They read the data-invalidation bus
 *   (`useDataInvalidation`), which every site that moves `refreshKey` also
 *   notifies. That half used to be missing — they kept `refreshKey` in their
 *   key instead (`REMOUNT_TO_REFRESH_VIEW_TYPES`), and these cases asserted a
 *   fresh instance until the renderers gained the bus input.
 *
 * Every case asserts BOTH:
 *   (a) the rendered view is the SAME instance after the write, and
 *   (b) it received rows read after the write.
 * The self-fetching cases also assert (c): the write costs exactly ONE refetch
 * of that view (no refetch storm).
 *
 * The stand-ins carry an instance id from a `useState` initializer, which runs
 * once per mount: a changed id IS a remount. The self-fetching stand-in reads
 * the REAL bus hook and queries on it exactly as `ObjectGrid` / `ObjectGantt` /
 * `ObjectChart` now do — each renderer's own pin
 * (`*.invalidationRefetch-10035.test.tsx` in its package) proves the real
 * component does that; this file proves the HOST keeps them mounted and tells
 * the bus.
