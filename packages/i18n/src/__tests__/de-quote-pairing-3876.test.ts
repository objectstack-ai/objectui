/**
 * objectui#3876 — the `de` pack paired the German **opening** quote
 * `„` („, low-9) with an **ASCII straight quote** `"` (") as its
 * closer, so German users read a typewriter quote where the typography of the
 * rest of the pack (and of German orthography, DUDEN R11) puts `“` (“).
 *
 * ## Census taken at landing (main@2937bcf7d), not inherited
 *
 * The card said "20 values"; the triage re-scan on an earlier main said "22
 * mismatched pairs". **Both are right about different units** and this file
 * exists partly to stop that ambiguity from recurring:
 *
 *   - **20 keys** carried a mismatch, and
 *   - **22 mismatch occurrences** lived in them — `navigationSync.renamedPage`
 *     and `navigationSync.renamedDashboard` each quote *two* names in one
 *     sentence ("Seite „alt“ in „neu“ umbenannt"), so they contribute two each.
 *
 * Full-file counts, before → after: `„` 45 → 45, `“` 25 → 47,
 * `”` 2 → 2, `"` 28 → 6.
 *
 * ## Why the invariant is NOT `count(„) === count(“)`
 *
 * The card proposed that assertion. It was **false on the file objectui#3876
 * left behind** (45 vs 47) and would have sent the next reader hunting a bug
 * that isn't there. Two values in this pack were still untranslated English
 * prose and quoted in the *English* style — `“…”`:
 *
 *   - `grid.import.savedMappingHint`
 *   - `grid.import.savedMappingPreviewNote`
 *
 * Their two `“` were legitimate **openers**, not German closers, which was
 * the whole 45/47 gap. The durable form that survives both that fix and a later
 * translation of those two values is
 *
 *     count(“) === count(„) + count(”)
 *
 * — every German `„` is closed by a `“`, and every *extra* `“` is
 * an English opener answered by a `”`; re-introducing one mismatch breaks it
 * (46 !== 47). The scan below is the primary check; the identity is the cheap
 * arithmetic backstop that also notices a `„` closed by nothing at all.
 *
 * ## objectui#3920 translated those two values — the numbers moved as predicted
 *
 * This header used to say "Germanising those two values keeps it true
 * (47 === 47 + 0)". objectui#3920 did exactly that (the five
 * `grid.import` saved-mapping keys were English in seven packs, not just de),
 * so the census is now `„` 47, `“` 47, `”` 0, `"` 6 and the identity holds in
 * its degenerate-looking but still non-vacuous form: 47 openers, all paired,
 * zero English closers left in the pack. The three literal counts below were
 * updated with that change and the two keys are pinned by name in a dedicated
 * `it` below — because `rdqKeys === []` on its own would stop naming *which*
 * values used to be the surplus, and an assertion that passes because nothing
 * is produced is exactly the shape this suite exists to avoid.
 *
 * ## objectui#3919 took the last straight quotes out — the pin is now "zero"
 *
 * Three `approvalsInbox` values (`rejectOneTitle`, `inlineApproved`,
 * `inlineRejected`) quoted with ASCII on **both** sides. Being self-consistent,
 * they were a second defect shape that the pairing scan below structurally cannot
 * see: there is no `„` in them to scan forward from. This file recorded them as
 * an explicit three-key list while that finding waited its turn, and a German
 * approver meanwhile read two typographies on one screen — `„…“` on the approve
 * confirmation, `"…"` on the reject one and on both inline toasts.
 *
 * objectui#3919 germanised the three, which takes the census to `„` 50, `“` 50,
 * `”` 0, `"` **0** and lets that list become the strictly stronger invariant it
 * now is: **no value in the de pack holds a U+0022 at all**. Stronger because it
 * catches both defect shapes — one side of a mismatched pair and both sides of a
 * self-consistent ASCII pair — and it needs no per-key maintenance: a new value
 * arriving with a typewriter quote fails by key name without anyone editing a
 * list. The three counts below moved 47 → 50 with that change.
 *
 * ## Why the three i18n gates cannot see any of this
 *
 * `all-locales-key-parity` compares key sets and placeholder shapes,
 * `check-i18n-call-site-keys.mjs` only asks whether a key resolves, and
 * `check-i18n-en-drift.mjs` fires on **`en` value changes** — these values were
 * wrong from the day they landed, so no drift event ever existed. All three are
 * value-blind by design, which is why the invariant has to live in a test.
