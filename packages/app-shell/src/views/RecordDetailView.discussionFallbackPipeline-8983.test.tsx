 * BOTH composition routes to the chatter panel render the SAME feed
 * (objectui#8983, re-aimed by objectui#7298)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A record page shows its discussion because the page composes a
 * `record:discussion` / `record:chatter` node, and there are two ways that node
 * gets into the tree:
 *
 *   SYNTHESIZED BLOCK   no authored record page ⇒ `buildDefaultPageSchema`
 *                       composes `record:discussion` itself.
 *   AUTHORED BLOCK      an authored page places the node in its own region,
 *                       beside whatever else it composes.
 *
 * Both resolve through `ComponentRegistry` to ONE `RecordChatterRenderer`, so
 * both must render one feed. objectui#8934 taught that renderer to run
 * `applyFeedConfig`, making the protocol's `feed` members and its DEFAULTS live
 * — and this file is what turns red if a future edit gives either route its own
 * items/config path instead.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT CHANGED UNDER THIS FILE. The second surface used to be the HOST
 * FALLBACK: an authored page that omitted the block got a panel auto-appended
 * by `RecordDetailView`, and for one round that fallback handed its rows to
 * `RecordChatterPanel` raw while the block ran the pipeline — a completed
 * activity showed on one and not the other, and a feed past twenty rows
 * rendered whole on one and paged on the other. objectui#8983 closed that by
 * BINDING rather than copying (the fallback started mounting the renderer with
 * no schema). objectui#7298 then retired the fallback outright — the maintainer
 * ruling of 2026-09-12: a page shows a discussion panel if and only if it
 * composes one. So the divergence this file was written about can no longer
 * arise from THAT pair; the pair it guards now is the two ways the node is
 * composed, and the pre-fix control below still measures what an UNBOUND
 * surface would have rendered.
 *
 * ## What makes the equality below a reading rather than a tautology
 *
 * "The two surfaces agree" is satisfied by a harness in which they could never
 * have disagreed — and it was satisfied by this repository's tree before
 * objectui#8934 too, when neither surface ran the pipeline. Three legs answer
 * that, and all three have to hold together:
 *
 *   PRE-FIX CONTROL   `PreFixFallbackShape` below is the retired host
 *                     fallback's JSX as it was written before objectui#8983 —
 *                     the same panel, the same hard-coded three affordances,
 *                     raw `items`. It is rendered on the SAME feed and asserted
 *                     to produce a DIFFERENT row set. So the fixture provably
 *                     discriminates: a surface that stops running the pipeline
 *                     fails the equality.
 *   AGREEMENT FIXTURE the shared row set is asserted by VALUE, and the value is
 *                     the pipeline's answer (completed row hidden, a 20-row
 *                     page window) rather than the raw feed. Both surfaces
 *                     rendering nothing, or both rendering everything, is red.
 *   NEUTRAL FIXTURE   the card's own control row — three comments and no
 *                     completed activity — on which all THREE shapes agree.
 *                     Without it, the two cases above could be reporting a
 *                     harness that can only ever produce disagreement.
 *
 * ⚠️ `Load more` is asserted as a COUNT and then clicked. `hasMore` without
 * `onLoadMore` renders a button that does nothing, which reads as "paging
 * works" to every assertion that only counts it.
 *
 * ## Resolution
 *
 * Nothing here resolves through any `dist/`: `./RecordDetailView` is this
 * package's own source and `@object-ui/plugin-detail` is mapped to its `src` by
 * the root `vitest.config.mts` alias table.
