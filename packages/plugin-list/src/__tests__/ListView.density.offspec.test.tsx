/**
 * What an off-spec `rowHeight` actually RENDERS — the empirical half of
 * objectui#4440, pinned on the live path rather than argued from the mapping.
 *
 * `ListView` is the only in-repo caller of `@object-ui/core`'s
 * `rowHeightToDensityMode`. Before #4440 that function coerced an unknown
 * `rowHeight` to `'comfortable'`, so a garbage value rendered the toolbar (and
 * the rows it forwards its density to) one step looser than an ABSENT
 * `rowHeight` did — absent has always resolved to `'compact'` here, and
 * `ObjectGrid` independently defaults `schema.rowHeight ?? 'compact'` too.
 *
 * After #4440 the mapping abstains and the caller's own "nothing was said"
 * default applies, so off-spec renders exactly like absent. That is the
 * measured consequence of aligning with `@object-ui/react`'s spec bridge, and
 * this file is where it is visible: the density button's `aria-label` is
 * `density.mode` verbatim.
 *
 * Note the abstain deliberately does NOT fall through to `useDensityMode`'s own
 * parameter default, which is `'comfortable'` — landing there would have
 * re-created the retired coercion one stack frame further down and left the two
 * surfaces disagreeing exactly as before, while looking like a fix.
