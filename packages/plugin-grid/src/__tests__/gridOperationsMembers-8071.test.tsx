/**
 * objectui#8071 slice 12 — the MEMBER shape `object-grid` reads inside
 * `operations`.
 *
 * ## What the registration cannot say
 *
 * `operations` is registered as an OBJECT-armed input. The arm says nothing
 * about which members are read, and the three that ARE read do not behave
 * alike: `update` and `delete` gate the row kebab's generic entries, `export`
 * gates the toolbar button — and the two halves carry OPPOSITE defaults once
 * the block is present at all. That asymmetry is invisible from the
 * registration, invisible from `ObjectGridSchema`, and is the thing an author
 * writing `operations: { export: false }` actually needs to know.
 *
 * ## The member facts pinned here, and why each is at the row rather than at a prop
 *
 *  1. **Presence REPLACES, it does not merge.** An authored block is taken
 *     whole: `{}` means "update: absent, delete: absent" and CLOSES both, even
 *     with `onEdit` / `onDelete` wired. Omitting the key entirely takes the
 *     wired-callback default instead. Merging the default UNDER the authored
 *     block (`{ ...defaults, ...authored }`) is the plausible simplification
 *     this file refuses: it reads identically on every schema that names
 *     `update`/`delete`, and silently re-opens generic Edit/Delete for every
 *     author who declared a block naming neither.
 *  2. **`update` and `delete` are independent**, not one write flag.
 *  3. **`operations` is the CEILING — an INTERSECTION with `rowActions`' canonical
 *     names, never a union.** `operations: { update: false }` closes row editing
 *     whatever `rowActions` says, and a member a PRESENT block does not name is
 *     closed too, so `rowActions: ['edit']` cannot select what the block
 *     withheld. ⚠️ This file pinned the OPPOSITE — the union — from slice 12
 *     until the maintainer ruling of 2026-09-18 (batch #162 item 1, letter A,
 *     objectui#9819) made the two gates intersections. The flip is that ruling
 *     landing, ⛔ not a regression; the union's own shape is kept below as the
 *     case that goes red if the `||` ever comes back.
 *     The ruling's OTHER half — `rowActions` NARROWING inside the ceiling —
 *     landed with objectui#10083: a DECLARED `rowActions` list offers the
 *     generic entry only for the canonical names it carries, while an ABSENT
 *     list keeps the default. Until then this file pinned the gap as a
 *     `NOT IMPLEMENTED` case; that case is flipped below, ⛔ not deleted.
 *  4. **Neither member is a grant.** Without the consumer's callback the
 *     affordance stays closed whatever the block says.
 *  5. **`export` defaults the OTHER WAY inside a present block** — omitted
 *     means allowed, and only an explicit `false` closes it.
 *
 * Every row-kebab claim is read out of an OPENED menu on a rendered row.
 * "The prop was computed" is green against a grid that draws the entry anyway,
 * which is the failure this key exists to prevent.
 *
 * Prior art, stated so this file is not read as the first word on the key:
 * `exportGate.test.tsx` already covers fact 5's three cases on their own;
 * `rowCrudEffectiveOps.test.tsx` and `rowOperationsPerRow-8674.test.tsx` cover
 * the layers ANDed on TOP of this key (the ADR-0103 bucket, `userActions`, the
 * server's effective operation set, the per-row predicate). None of them states
 * facts 1-4, which are the key's own members.
