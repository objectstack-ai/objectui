/**
 * Leaving a wizard step while its upload is in flight must not lose the file
 * (objectui#10180).
 *
 * ## The defect, as measured on the tree this fix landed on
 *
 * The user picks a file on step 1, presses Next before the upload settles,
 * fills the last step and presses Create. The record was written WITHOUT the
 * attachment and the wizard reported success.
 *
 * The file itself was never the casualty: `FileField` does not abort its upload
 * when the step unmounts, and the settle still reaches the form's `onChange`,
 * which accepts it (react-hook-form re-registers a field it no longer tracks).
 * A Create pressed AFTER the settle already stored the fileId. What the unmount
 * ended was the widget's REPORT: leaving the step released its entry in the
 * uploading scope, so the final-commit gate objectui#10166 put on `WizardForm`
 * read `false` while the file was still on its way — Create was enabled and
 * labelled "Create", and pressing it in that window wrote the record without
 * the file. The repair is on the producer side, in `@object-ui/fields`: the
 * upload widgets hold the scope for the upload's own lifetime, which outlasts
 * the step (`useUploadingScopeHold`).
 *
 * ## Why this is a DIFFERENTIAL on the stored value
 *
 * Same shape as `uploadInFlightSave.test.tsx`, for the same reason: the defect
 * is a success, so "no error" passes on it. Each row issues the SAME final
 * gesture twice — mid-upload, then after the settle — and asserts the STORED
 * VALUE first, before any affordance, so it fails on the write and not on a
 * label. It closes on the invariant no weakening can satisfy on the defect:
 * exactly one record reached the adapter across both gestures, and it carries
 * the file the user picked on step 1.
 *
 * ## What is real and what is faked
 *
 * Only the upload TRANSPORT is faked — an `UploadProvider` adapter whose promise
 * this test settles — because that is what makes the mid-upload window
 * deterministic. The widgets are the shipping `FileField` / `ImageField`, driven
 * through their real file input; the form renderer, react-hook-form and the
 * wizard are real. Both widgets are registered directly rather than through
 * their lazy entries so no module load races the assertions, and the lazy
 * entries are put back afterwards because the registry is shared per worker.
