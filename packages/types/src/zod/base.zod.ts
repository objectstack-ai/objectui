/**
 * ⭐ THE IMPORT BOUNDARY (objectui#8317, decision batch #90, 2026-09-08).
 *
 * **This mirror authors no default, imported subschemas included.** Batch #69
 * (objectui#7735) ruled that a validator validates and does not write values
 * into an author's document; batch #90 ruled that this holds for EVERY key
 * `safeValidateSchema` answers, not only the sites this repository wrote. So a
 * schema arriving from `@objectstack/spec` crosses into a mirror shape only
 * through `stripImportedDefaults`, which removes each reachable `ZodDefault`
 * with `.removeDefault()` and keeps the key omissible. Keys, types, checks and
 * the accept set are untouched, and a subtree carrying no default comes back
 * reference-equal — so this is a no-op the day the spec adopts the same
 * principle.
 *
 * ⛔ Spelled at every crossing rather than once per file, deliberately: a local
 * `const Spec… = stripImportedDefaults(…)` would put the spec's provenance one
 * hop away from every declaration that reads it, and `check:spec-symbols`
 * (rule 1) reads exactly one hop — a mirror export under a spec-owned name has
 * to show the spec binding in its OWN initializer. The verbosity is the
 * provenance.
 *
 * ⚠️ A read that is NOT a crossing stays unwrapped and is declared as such: a
 * value VOCABULARY (`./views.zod.ts`'s `SpecListViewTypeEnum` and
 * `./objectql.zod.ts`'s `ViewKindEnum`, which unwrap the spec's own
 * `.default('grid')` to reach its enum) and a TYPE position — neither puts a
 * default into a parsed document. `../__tests__/imported-defaults-8317.test.ts`
 * re-derives that exception list from the source rather than trusting this
 * paragraph, and fails if an entry stops matching a real read.

 *
 * Hand-written rather than taken from the spec because the spec has no keyed

/**
 * Fill the node recursion point with the component union, and hand it straight
 * back — so the fill is part of `AnyComponentSchema`'s own initializer in
 * `index.zod.ts` rather than a bare statement beside it (objectui#8344).
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why a WRITE INTO the union's option list, and not a `z.lazy` holder
 *
 * The obvious spelling — a `let` the `z.lazy` getter reads — is WRONG here, and
 * measurably so. `z.lazy` MEMOISES: zod 4.4.3 caches the resolved inner on first
 * access, and merely parsing any component schema resolves it (the union arm walk
 * reads every option to compute its own metadata, so a childless `detail-view` node
 * is enough). ⇒ whatever the getter returned FIRST would be the accept set for the
 * rest of the process, decided by whichever module graph parsed first — and this
 * repo's `isolate: false` unit project shares one module graph across every file in
 * a worker. Measured on this branch with that spelling in place: the #8344 pin
 * PASSED run alone and FAILED in the full run, because
 * `__tests__/handler-keys-string-any-mirrors-7344.test.ts` parses from a barrel-free
 * import graph and froze the base shape in first. Refusing instead of falling back
 * converges, but turns that same import order into dozens of red suites.
 *
 * ⭐ A `z.union` does NOT memoise its options: measured on zod 4.4.3, `z.union(opts)`
 * keeps `opts` BY REFERENCE and re-reads it on every parse, so writing slot 0 takes
 * effect immediately — including after parses have already run through it. That is
 * what makes the window disappear rather than merely move: before the fill a child
 * slot answers exactly as it did pre-#8344, after it every parse sees the component
 * union, and no first-parse ever freezes the wrong answer in.
 *
 * ⚠️ That by-reference behaviour is the load-bearing assumption, so it is ASSERTED
 * here rather than trusted: a zod that copied the array would leave this silently
 * under-enforcing — the one failure direction that never announces itself.
 *
 * ⚠️ The parameter bound is `z.ZodType`, not `z.ZodType< SchemaNode, SchemaNode >`,
 * and that too is measured. The tighter bound is the one this wiring wants — "the
 * recursion point may only be filled with something a declared `SchemaNode` slot
 * could already hold" — and `tsc` refuses it TODAY for exactly one arm out of 106:
 * `complex.zod.ts#ChatbotSchema` mirrors the chat API body params under the key
 * `body`, which is `BaseSchema`'s CHILDREN slot (`Record< string, unknown >` where
 * the base says `SchemaNode | SchemaNode[]`). That collision is pre-existing and
 * already recorded — the parity ledger carries it under `KnownDrift`, the TS
 * declaration renamed the key to `requestBody`, and `ChatbotSharedMirrorShape` in
 * `complex.zod.ts` says in as many words that a ruling on `ChatbotSchema`'s own
 * `body` arm is a separate question. ⛔ #8344 does not decide it either. So the bound
 * is loose HERE and the real check is kept EXACT one level out, as a type-level pin
 * naming that single arm in `__tests__/node-recursion-point-8344.test.ts`. ⇒ a SECOND
 * arm drifting the same way turns that pin red instead of passing unnoticed.
 *
 * @internal — the package's only zod entry point is the `./zod` barrel, which is
 * `index.zod.ts`; this exists for that one call site and is not re-exported.

/**
 * Schema Node — what a child slot holds: a COMPONENT document, or a primitive.
 *
 * ## The component arm is `AnyComponentSchema` (objectui#8344)
 *
 * Every child slot (`body`, `children`, and every per-component redeclaration of
 * them) is `z.union([SchemaNodeSchema, z.array(SchemaNodeSchema)])`, so this const
 * is where the whole node tree recurses. Until #8344 the component arm was
 * `BaseSchemaCore` — the ~21 base keys and NOTHING type-specific — which made
 * per-type enforcement ROOT-ONLY, at every depth, for every component type. That
 * is objectui#7869, measured there: an off-spec `size` on a NESTED `icon` node was
 * accepted, and the same node alone was refused. Pointing the arm at the union of
 * the registered component mirrors is the whole of this change; ⛔ nothing here is
 * `.strict()`, and `BaseSchemaCore` keeps its passthrough.
 *
 * Priced at 9 newly-refused corpus documents (objectui#8344's R3, 54 / 553 against
 * R1's 45 / 553), each one pre-existing debt this SURFACES rather than creates:
 * four whose child `type` resolves in no arm, five already red under their own
 * schema and shielded until now by the recursion point.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why the arm is late-bound and not imported
 *
 * `AnyComponentSchema` is built in `index.zod.ts` out of all 13 category modules,
 * and 14 modules import THIS one — so naming it here is a module cycle, and
 * `z.lazy` defers the EVALUATION, not the module graph. With that import in place,
 * entering the graph at `base.zod.js` evaluates `app.zod.ts`'s body while
 * `BaseSchema` is still in its temporal dead zone and the package throws on import.
 * ⇒ the break is deliberate: `index.zod.ts` fills the holder through
 * {@link defineNodeComponentUnion} as it constructs the union, which is module
 * evaluation and therefore strictly before anything can parse.
 *
 * ⚠️ BEFORE the fill — a module graph that reaches a parse without ever evaluating
 * `index.zod.js` — the arm is `BaseSchemaCore`, i.e. exactly the pre-#8344 accept
 * set, and it switches the moment the barrel loads. That is a property of the WRITE,
 * not a tolerated fallback: `z.union` re-reads its option array on every parse, so
 * nothing can freeze the pre-fill answer in ({@link defineNodeComponentUnion} carries
 * the measurement, and why the obvious `z.lazy` holder is wrong). No published entry
 * point can reach that window BY MODULE GRAPH: `./zod` is this package's only zod
 * subpath and it IS `index.zod.js`. Pinned in
 * `__tests__/node-recursion-point-8344.test.ts`.
 *
 * ⛔ ⚠️ THAT SENTENCE IS ABOUT MODULE GRAPHS, AND A BUNDLER IS NOT ONE. This package
 * declares `"sideEffects": false` and the fill is a statement in this barrel's body,
 * so a bundler that honours the flag and sees no reference to `AnyComponentSchema`
 * may drop the whole const — fill included — and then every child slot validates
 * with the PRE-#8344 arm. Measured on the published `dist/zod` face of this package
 * (Vite 8.2.1 lib build, `es`, esbuild-minified, `zod` 4.4.3 and `@objectstack/spec`
 * external, so the figures are this package's own bytes — the same instrument and
 * the same figures the objectui#8344 changeset cites): a barrel entry importing only
 * `CardSchema` ACCEPTS a nested off-spec node (212,567 bytes, fill absent), an entry
 * that deep-links `layout.zod.js` ACCEPTS it too (212,563 bytes, fill absent), and
 * the barrel entry with `AnyComponentSchema` also imported REFUSES it (750,542
 * bytes, fill present). The guard below cannot see this: it runs inside the code
 * that was dropped. ⇒ this window is silent, it is NOT the pre-fill window this
 * paragraph describes, and it ships DECLARED (objectui#8344 decision batch #98): an
 * external consumer whose bundler honours the flag and never reads
 * `AnyComponentSchema` keeps the pre-#8344 accept set for NESTED nodes; root-level
 * enforcement and every consumer whose graph reads the union get the new set.
 * Closing it is objectui#8598 — the `./zod` face built as ONE module — ⛔ not an
 * import of the union from here: that spelling was measured to throw at load in a
 * real consumer's bundle (the changeset carries the CI evidence).
 *
 * ## Both type arguments are filled, and that is the whole published input face
 *
 * `z.ZodType< SchemaNode, SchemaNode >` — OUTPUT and INPUT. The annotation is still
 * here for the reason it always was: the initializer names `BaseSchemaCore`, which
 * names this const back through its own `body` / `children` slots, so without an
 * explicit type TypeScript cannot resolve either one. What changed (objectui#7760,
 * maintainer ruling, decision batch #69) is the ARGUMENT. It used to be `any`, and
 * zod 4 defaults the INPUT parameter of `z.ZodType< any >` to `unknown` — so every
 * slot spelled through this const published `unknown` as the shape an author may
 * write, which is wider than every declaration BY DEFINITION and says nothing about
 * what this schema accepts at runtime.
 *
 * ⛔ `SchemaNode` in `../base.ts` did NOT move under #8344 either: the TS face still
 * says `BaseSchema | primitive`, and `BaseSchema` carries an index signature, so the
 * runtime accept set is now NARROWER than the declaration rather than wider. The
 * declaration repair is its own worklist and ⛔ not this const's to make.
 *
 * ⭐ What #7760 bought: `__tests__/zod-mirror-parity.test.ts` can now compare the
 * `z.union([SchemaNodeSchema, z.array(SchemaNodeSchema)])` single-or-list slots that
 * objectui#7069 called this repo's systematic producer and had to EXCLUDE — its
 * `Unconstrained` predicate was dropping every one of them. Three real widenings came
 * out of that region on the first run and are ledgered there.
 *
 * ⚠️ Seven of the ten recursion-breaking mirrors took this treatment; three refused
 * it and keep `z.ZodType<any>` (`app.zod.ts#NavigationItemSchema`,
 * `complex.zod.ts#FilterBuilderConditionSchema` and, transitively,
 * `complex.zod.ts#FilterGroupSchema`) — in each case because the mirror already
 * ACCEPTS more than its declaration states, so filling the argument is the wider
 * comparison and `tsc` refuses the assignment. ⛔ Do not "fix" those three by widening
 * a declaration or narrowing a mirror to make the annotation fit: either is a
 * contract change wearing a type-annotation's clothes, and both are ruled elsewhere.

 * Event handlers — NOTE, not a declaration. There is deliberately no

 *
 * `EventHandlersSchema`, a `z.record(z.string(), z.function())`, stood at this
 * spot until objectui#6910 retired it under ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove
 * (maintainer ruling on objectui#6124, decision batch #8, reconfirmed in batch
 * #25). It was a published export of `@object-ui/types/zod` that **no JSON
 * document could ever satisfy** — every value it accepted had to be a function
 * — and that nothing in this package composed. It could therefore neither
 * admit a correct authoring nor refuse a wrong one: an author reading the
 * published surface got no signal in either direction, which is exactly the
 * shape ADR-0049 exists to remove.
 *
 * Why no JSON-authorable replacement can be written here, i.e. why this is a
 * NOTE and not a narrower schema: on the JSON face handlers are not values at
 * all. The per-node `on*` handler keys that do exist are declared through
 * `handlerKeyRefusal()` in `./tombstone.zod.ts`, which refuses EVERY value —
 * an authored object and a live function alike — and carries the remedy in
 * its own message: author behaviour as a NODE TYPE, an `action:` node with a
 * declared action, the spelling PR #6498 established. A record of function
 * values is that same unauthorable shape with the key set left open as well,
 * so narrowing it could only make the refusal harder to read. The
 * function-valued face is a TypeScript prop shape, declared as `EventHandlers`
 * in `../base.ts`; a zod mirror of it would mirror something that never
 * crosses the wire.
 *
 * ⚠️ `BaseSchema` declares NO `events` key, and this note asserted that it did
 * until the claim was checked against the tree. AGENTS.md's abridged protocol
 * sketch shows `events?: Record<string, ActionSchema[]>` and its action-system
 * commandment authors one, but `BaseSchemaCore` declares no such member and
 * nothing reads `schema.events`: whatever a document writes under that key,
 * no renderer runs it. `BaseSchemaCore` is `.passthrough()`, so such a node is
 * KEPT, judged by nothing and run by nothing. ⛔ Do not send an author there.
 * ⛔ No count of authored `events` keys is stated here — objectui#9553 carries
 * that census. A census answer frozen into a comment is the defect AGENTS.md
 * commandment #9 forbids, and this note shipped one once already: the first
 * version of this paragraph named a total that was wrong on the day it was
 * written, and it reached the emitted `.d.ts` before review caught it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Do not conclude from a clean sweep that no second one of these exists.
 * Both standing instruments are structurally blind to this shape: the
 * `z.function()` census matches the `key: z.function(` spelling and a record's
 * VALUE type is not a key, and `../__tests__/zod-mirror-parity.test.ts`
 * exempts index signatures by design ("no keys to compare"). This note, not a
 * gate, is what records the absence.
 *
 * Precedent of the same shape: objectstack#12009 / PR #13413.
