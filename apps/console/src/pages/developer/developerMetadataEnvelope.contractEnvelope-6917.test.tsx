/**
 * The two developer pages read a `client.meta.getItems()` answer as the
 * metadata API DECLARES it — and do NOT read `value` (objectui#6917 arm B).
 *
 * ── The seam is NOT `DataSource.find()`, and that changed the measurement ──
 * objectui#6917 filed these two sites as "the same arm objectui#6840 removed",
 * i.e. a non-`QueryResult` key at the `DataSource.find()` seam. They are not.
 * `QueryResult` (`@object-ui/types`) never reaches here: these pages call
 * `client.meta.getItems(type)`, whose envelope is `{ type, items: [...] }`, or
 * a bare array on the ADR-0037 preview path. `data` is not one of its members
 * either — `MetadataProvider.extractItems` pins `{ data: [...] }` to `[]`.
 *
 * That is objectui#6917's own central rule turned on the card: a zero measured
 * at one seam says nothing about another. So the census below was run on the
 * `meta.getItems` JOIN, not on the `find()` join the card named:
 *
 *   CELL      every `meta.getItems` producer body in the repo ....  28 producers
 *   CONTROL   `items` emitted as an envelope member .............   18 producers
 *   SUBJECT   `value` emitted as an envelope member ............     0 producers
 *
 * Superset sweep, so a shape assembled outside a producer body still surfaces:
 * of the 25 files holding a producer, 6 contain the token `value:` anywhere,
 * and all 6 are filter-condition values, select options, a DOM helper
 * parameter or a storage shim — none an envelope member. The control sits on
 * the JOIN (same cell, same pass, same extraction), so the zero is a reading.
 *
 * The two canonical in-repo readers of this envelope agree and neither has ever
 * had a `value` arm: `MetadataProvider.extractItems` (bare array | `items`) and
 * `MetadataService.getItems` (`items` only).
 *
 * ⛔ The fix is the deletion, NOT widening any published type to bless `value`
 * — the floor objectui#6726, #6840 and #6839 all held.
 *
 * The live arms are pinned beside the dead one, because live-versus-dead is the
 * whole distinction. No precedence case appears here: `value` sat LAST, behind
 * both live arms, so no ordering was ever observable at these two sites. (The
 * one site on this card that DID invert is `packages/fields`, pinned there.)
