### Minor Changes

- 64dae8e: Six user-visible fixes across the maker surface, the assistant rail and the
  dataset captions.
  
  **The maker's start chips now promise only what ADR-0112 v1 builds
  (cloud#1984).** Two of the five asked for automation the first version has no
  flows or actions for — the ticket chip said 「状态流转」, the inventory chip said
  「低库存预警」 — and the measured behaviour was not a refusal but a silent
  degrade: a status kanban and a low-stock view. The chip promised an alert and
  delivered a page. All five are reworded in all ten packs (and in the call-site
  `defaultValue` fallbacks, which are a second copy of the same strings) to ask
  for objects, fields, views, pages, dashboards and sample data, keeping each a
  real business scenario — the ticket chip now asks for a status field and a board
  grouped by it, the inventory chip for a view that filters below the reorder
  point. A note beside the keys says to revert when v2 re-adds flows.
  
  **Five newer AI tools get their step labels (objectui#7481).** A zh conversation
  read `✓ Get authoring rules 已完成` between 「读取元数据结构」 and 「列出对象」:
  `get_authoring_rules` (cloud#1837), plus `load_tools`, `open_record`,
  `test_flow` and `toggle_flow`, are registered by the cloud AI runtime but are
  newer than the pinned spec's tool registry, so they had no `chatbot.tool.*`
  entry in any pack and fell through to the English title-caser.
  
  **The assistant rail follows the thread when you send (objectui#7480).** The
  rail and the full-page maker are the same component; what differs is width. A
  reply that still ends on screen in the wide column runs two or three times
  taller in a ~360px rail, so `StickToBottom`'s lock is escaped by the time the
  user types and the new bubble, the tool steps and the streaming answer all land
  below the fold. Every send path now re-arms the lock — including the plan-card
  "Build it" and 确认修改 approvals, whose own code comments already named this
  miss. Message APPENDS deliberately do not, so a user reading back through the
  thread mid-answer is never yanked to the bottom.
  
  **Console toasts move off the assistant composer (objectui#7482).** 「客户更新
  成功」 sat on the ChatDock composer's send button and stayed there. One defect,
  two symptoms: `apps/console` pinned the toaster to `bottom-right` — an override
  that predates ADR-0057 P3a — so a toast both covered the button and, because
  sonner pauses a toast's dismiss timer while the pointer is inside the toaster
  region, never got to run its 4s timer with a pointer resting on the composer
  underneath. The override is gone; the console takes `ConsoleToaster`'s own
  documented top-right anchor, and the 4s success duration is now pinned.
  
  **Built-in aggregate captions follow the locale everywhere (objectui#7534).**
  objectui#7258 taught `buildChartSeries()` to resolve a server-minted default
  measure through the locale map, so a chart legend read `计数` while the table
  beneath it, the KPI caption, the pivot header and the dataset preview still
  printed the server's hard-coded English `Count`. `buildDatasetFieldHelpers()`
  takes the same optional `builtinAggregateLabels`, resolving through the one
  `resolveMeasureLabel` order, and the five call sites pass it. Omitting the
  argument reproduces the previous output byte for byte, and an author-declared
  measure still keeps its own label verbatim (objectui#4106).
  
  **The activity feed stops asking for an object the environment does not have
  (objectui#7476).** A tenant environment has no `sys_activity`, so every page
  load issued a request that 404'd. Everything downstream was already correct —
  the adapter memoizes the missing collection, its logger demotes the failure, the
  feed retires as an ANSWER and the panel renders its earned empty state — so what
  is left is the request itself, and `data-objectstack` states the rule for it:
  the cure for a doomed request is not issuing it. New `useObjectPresence` reads
  the object registry the shell loads for the nav anyway; only a registry that has
  ANSWERED and lists other objects without this one skips the read. Every
  uncertainty — no provider, empty registry, still loading, errored — reads as
  before, because a wrong skip would cost a real deployment its feed.
- 053fdc8: Console half of `ActionSchema.onSuccess` post-success navigation.
  
  `@objectstack/spec` declares `onSuccess` as a closed strict object
  `{ navigate: string, openIn: 'self' | 'newTab' }`, refine-scoped to `type: 'api'` and
  `type: 'script'` — the two action types whose success event carries a server response.
  Nothing in this renderer read it, so an action declaring the hop navigated nowhere: the
  block fell into `ActionRunner`'s older `ActionDef.onSuccess` chained-callback channel,
  was dispatched as an action, and failed inside `executeNavigation` with "No URL provided
  for navigation action" — a red toast and no jump. The motivating report is a clone action
  that leaves the user sitting on the record they cloned from.
  
  `ActionRunner.handlePostExecution` now performs the declared hop through
  `navigationHandler` — the same SPA seam every other navigator in that file uses, which
  the console wires to react-router's `navigate`, so `openIn: 'self'` is a real in-place
  route hop rather than a full-page load. `interpolateTarget` gains a `${result.*}` scope
  alongside `${param.*}` and `${ctx.*}`, resolved against the handler's own return value
  (the level `readActionPayload` reads, one below the action envelope) and supplied only by
  this call site, so a target interpolated before its request still has no `result` to
  name. `openIn` is read as the one member that changes the branch and no default is
  written here — the spec materialises `.default('self')`, so parse output always carries a
  resolved member — and the two `openIn` spellings stay apart: this reads
  `onSuccess.openIn` (`'self' | 'newTab'`), never the top-level `type: 'url'` switch
  (`'self' | 'new-tab'`), each of which spec refuses in the other's position.
  
  The console's server-action wrapper gains the matching handler-return half: a handler may
  now return `openIn: 'self'` next to its `redirectUrl` to ask for the same-tab jump, while
  a `redirectUrl` **without** `openIn` keeps its shipped new-tab behaviour unchanged. When
  an action declares an `onSuccess` block, the wrapper defers to the runner and only tidies
  its pre-opened tab, so one navigation happens rather than two.
  
  The pre-existing `ActionDef.onSuccess` chained-callback channel is unchanged. It is told
  apart by the spec's own declaration — a non-array object whose `navigate` is a string —
  and keeps running for every other shape.
- 490d9a9: Grid headers offer a sort click only on columns the PLATFORM says it will order by
  (objectui#5729 — the consumer leg of objectstack#10235, maintainer ruling A, 2026-08-23:
  the platform serves an explicit per-column sortability signal and the grid reads it,
  rather than re-deriving "virtual ⇒ unsortable" from field type).
  
  `GET /api/v1/meta/object/:name` now answers with a `sortability` projection on its
  ENVELOPE — `{ fields: { [name]: { sortable, reason?, caveat? } } }`, computed at serve
  time from the platform's own storage predicates, deliberately beside `item` rather than
  inside it so the key stays un-authorable. The signal was reaching the browser and being
  discarded one line before its only consumer: `ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema` unwraps
  the envelope to `item`, so every UI reader saw a document with no signal on it. It now
  survives that unwrap, carried on the schema under a symbol key — invisible to
  `JSON.stringify`, to `Object.keys` and to a spread, so a schema handed back at a metadata
  write endpoint can never take it into a body the server parses strictly.
  
  `@object-ui/core` gains the one spelling of the consumer contract:
  `isPlatformSortableField(projection, name)` is `true` iff an entry EXISTS for the name and
  says `sortable: true`. Absence is a refusal — it is how the platform encodes an unknown
  name, a dotted path and an unprovisioned audit column, all three of which the runtime
  doors reject — so the `!== false` spelling every other optional flag in this repo uses
  would get exactly that family backwards. A projection that is absent ALTOGETHER is a
  different question with a different answer (`undefined`: no signal was served) and is
  typed apart from an empty one, so a deployment older than the upstream change keeps the
  behaviour it had rather than being told, falsely, that nothing on the object is sortable.
  
  Three things follow in the grid. The header click on a refused column ceases to exist, so
  neither the old silent-unordered result nor the `400 INVALID_SORT` that replaced it is
  reachable from it. A sort PERSISTED before the signal existed is filtered out of both what
  the grid renders and what it emits, so a restored personalization cannot ride back into
  the next `persistViewPatch({ sort })` — the half-fix where the affordance is gone and the
  PUT still fires. And the relational carve-out is untouched and deliberately not delegated
  to this signal: the platform answers `sortable: true` for a `lookup` (it has a stored
  foreign key and both runtime doors accept ordering by it), while the grid withholds that
  header for a different reason — a column of names ordered by an invisible id.
  
  Columns carrying `caveat: 'unprovisioned-anchor'` keep their click. The runtime accepts
  those sorts; refusing what the platform does not refuse would recreate declared-≠-enforced
  drift in mirror image.
- 2c3cd1b: BREAKING (`@object-ui/core`): `ActionRunner`'s legacy `ActionDef.onSuccess`
  chained-callback channel is retired — `onSuccess` now has exactly the meaning the
  contract declares (objectui#5934, maintainer ruling 2026-08-31).
  
  (The bump is `minor` by this repo's release model — objectui's major is pinned to
  the `@objectstack` family major, and its own breaking changes ship as `minor` with
  the break spelled out here, per `scripts/check-changeset-no-major.mjs`. This
  paragraph is that spelling-out: the break below is real and consumer-visible.)
  
  - **What breaks, by specifier**: `import type { ActionDef } from '@object-ui/core'` —
    `ActionDef['onSuccess']` was `ActionDef | ActionDef[]` (chained callbacks the runner
    dispatched through `executeChain` after a success). It is now derived from the pinned
    spec: `ActionSchema.onSuccess`'s closed strict `{ navigate: string, openIn?: 'self' |
    'newTab' }` block. Code that assigned a callback `ActionDef` (or an array of them) to
    `onSuccess` no longer compiles, and at runtime a callback-shaped value gets NO reading —
    no handler dispatch, no navigation, the action's own result untouched. `onFailure` is NOT
    changed: the spec declares no such key, so it keeps its one runner-native meaning.
  - **Why this is safe to take**: the channel was unreachable from validated metadata —
    `@objectstack/spec` (17.2.0 pin) strict-refuses a callback shape inside `onSuccess` at
    parse (`invalid_type` on `navigate` + `unrecognized_keys`), so no published/saved
    metadata could ever carry one — and a producer census with a positive control found zero
    producers outside the channel's own test pins. Migration for an out-of-repo consumer that
    drove the channel programmatically: put the follow-up actions in `chain` (the runner's
    declared chaining key, unchanged), or author the spec's `onSuccess` navigation block.
  - `@object-ui/types` (minor): `UIActionSchema` now declares `onSuccess`, derived from the
    spec's `ActionSchema.onSuccess` — the renderer view spells the key the four action
    surfaces forward, so the forwards type-check.
  - `@object-ui/components` (patch): the four action renderers forward `onSuccess` without
    the `as any` casts (no behavior change — same key, same value, now typed).
- 44d075b: `ComponentMeta` at the registry is now DERIVED from the one declaration in
  `@object-ui/types` instead of restating it, and `tags` / `description` reach the
  registration surface (objectui#6067).
  
  ## The convergence
  
  `packages/core/src/registry/Registry.ts` declared its own `ComponentMeta`: thirteen
  keys, of which nine were restated from `@object-ui/types`' `base.ts`, four were
  registry-only (`tier`, `namespace`, `skipFallback`, `labelling`), and `tags` /
  `description` were **absent** — although both are declared on the canonical type and on
  the `ComponentMetaSchema` zod mirror. Two of the three authorities agreed and the
  registration surface did not, so those two keys were unwritable at exactly the
  declaration most component registrations import. That is the same two-key delta
  objectui#5893 had just closed inside `@object-ui/types`, arriving a third time on a
  third declaration, and objectui#5671 had already made the identical move for the sibling
  type `ComponentInput` in this very file.
  
  It is now:
  
  ```ts
  export type RegistryComponentMetaExtras = {
    tier?: 'public' | 'internal';
    namespace?: string;
    skipFallback?: boolean;
    labelling?: 'control' | 'group' | 'display';
  };
  
  export type ComponentMeta = CanonicalComponentMeta & RegistryComponentMetaExtras;
  ```
  
  `RegistryComponentMetaExtras` is newly exported from `@object-ui/core`.
  
  **What changes for a consumer: `tags` and `description` become writable on the registry's
  `ComponentMeta`. Nothing narrows.** No key is removed, no key is renamed, and no key's
  type changes, so no existing registration stops compiling — verified by type-checking all
  37 workspace consumers of `@object-ui/core` (`pnpm --filter '...@object-ui/core'`), which
  is why this is a widening rather than the contract break a rename would have been. All
  four registry-only keys have live consumers, and they are still declared here.
  
  This is `minor` under this repository's policy that its own breaking changes never declare
  `major` (`scripts/check-changeset-no-major.mjs`); nothing here is breaking in any case.
  
  ## Converge rather than rename, and why the four keys did not move
  
  The alternative dispositions were to rename the type so the name stops claiming a mirror,
  or to move the four registry keys onto `@object-ui/types`' `ComponentMeta` and re-export
  it outright the way objectui#5671 handled `ComponentInput`.
  
  Renaming was rejected because it cannot be done without a break: `@object-ui/core` is
  published, `ComponentMeta` is exported from it, and dropping the name would break every
  external consumer — while keeping it as an alias would leave the mirror claim standing
  under a second spelling, which fixes nothing.
  
  Moving the four keys was rejected because `skipFallback` and `namespace` are registration
  mechanics — they describe how the registry keys an entry, not what a component is — and
  `@object-ui/types`' `ComponentMeta` is the general, plugin-facing, AI-facing type. The
  extension keeps them where they are read, under their own named type, while the eleven
  shared members exist in exactly one place and can no longer drift.
  
  ## Pinned by key set, not by assignability
  
  Every member of both shapes is optional, so `extends` is mutually **true** across the
  diverged pair — an assignability assertion is green on the defect and would not have
  caught it. Measured on the emitted `.d.ts` of both packages, before and after:
  
  | reading | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | `Core extends Canonical` | `true` | `true` |
  | `Canonical extends Core` | `true` | `true` |
  | `Exclude<keyof Canonical, keyof Core>` | `"tags" \| "description"` | `never` |
  | `Exclude<keyof Core, keyof Canonical>` | the four registry keys | the four registry keys |
  
  The new pin asserts the third row and names the fourth explicitly; the assignability pair
  is kept beside it, labelled, as the control that shows what it cannot see. A source-level
  assertion that the canonical members are not restated locally covers the remaining failure
  mode — a member-identical copy, which every `keyof` comparison stays green on and which is
  how the copy this replaces began.
- 8f1d995: `ComponentConfig` now has one authority: `@object-ui/types` declares it, `@object-ui/core` re-exports it
  
  `@object-ui/types` and `@object-ui/core` each published a declaration of
  `ComponentConfig`, so an auto-import picked between two different types by
  alphabetical order. After the `ComponentMeta` convergence the remaining
  difference was genericity and the `component` slot: `@object-ui/types`' was
  non-generic with `component: any`, core's was `<T = any>` with
  `component: ComponentRenderer<T>`.
  
  `@object-ui/types`' declaration gains that type parameter, **defaulted**, so
  every existing spelling keeps its meaning exactly — bare `ComponentConfig` is
  `ComponentConfig<any>`, whose `component` is `any`, as before. `@object-ui/core`
  re-exports it instead of declaring its own.
  
  The registry-only keys (`tier`, `namespace`, `skipFallback`, `labelling`,
  `deprecated`) were not dropped: they moved to a named extension,
  `RegistryComponentConfig`, which is what `Registry.getConfig`,
  `getAllConfigs` and `getNamespaceComponents` return. Those return values are
  type-identical to what they returned before, so every read path is unchanged.
  
  **Breaking:** a consumer that imports `ComponentConfig` from `@object-ui/core`
  *and* touches one of those five registry-only keys through that annotation must
  switch the annotation to `RegistryComponentConfig` — the name `ComponentConfig`
  no longer carries them there. Filed `minor` rather than `major` per AGENTS.md's
  versioning policy: objectui's own breaking changes ship as `minor` with the break
  spelled out here, because the whole publishable set is one changeset `fixed` group
  pinned to `@objectstack`'s major.
- 7977ff9: Component deprecation is now DECLARED, not just warned about (objectui#6674).
  
  A deprecated component type used to be stated in exactly two places, neither of
  which a gate, a test or a type can consult: a `console.warn` string literal
  inside the renderer, and the word "(Deprecated)" inside a human-readable
  `label`. Both gates that touch component types ask a different question —
  whether the type RESOLVES — and a deprecated type resolves, which is how one
  could be authored 85 times across 27 shipped exemplars with every check green.
  
  - `@object-ui/core` gains `ComponentDeprecation` / `AuthoringSurface` and the
    `deprecated` key on the registration metadata, plus
    `ComponentRegistry.deprecationFor(type, surface)` to read it back. The
    declaration carries the SURFACES it applies to rather than being a boolean:
    `div` and `span` are deprecated on the JSON authoring surface and are at the
    same time permanent vocabulary of the `kind:'html'` tier, so a bare flag would
    be false for one of its two readers.
  - `@object-ui/components` marks `div` and `span` with the declaration their
    console notices already state. Nothing new is deprecated and no build starts
    failing: the catalog ratchet keeps the existing stock frozen, and draining it
    stays objectui#3965's worklist.
- 3beef6d: The spec's `dataSource` element binding is now DECLARED by the blocks that read
  it, so the html tier stops reporting the one working saved-view spelling as
  `unknown-prop` (objectui#6678).
  
  `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` — `{ object, view, filter, sort, limit }` — is
  the one spelling that resolves a saved view for an object-bound block. It works,
  and it drew the identical `unknown-prop` warning as the two spellings that do
  nothing (`viewName`, `view`), because `validateTree` looks a prop up in the
  block's declared `inputs` and no registration declared this key. On the tier
  built to accept AI-authored pages, where the diagnostic IS the contract, the
  only signal pointed away from the key that works.
  
  Adopting the maintainer ruling of 2026-08-29 — option B **in the injection
  form**:
  
  - `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT` is the single declaration, in `@object-ui/core`
    beside the binding's own semantics; `Registry.register` emits it for any
    registration whose renderer passed through the new `elementDataSourceBlock()`
    seam. One mechanism, one copy — not a hand-kept declaration per block, which is
    the shape that drifts and that a new block forgets. The seam lives in
    `@object-ui/core` and is re-exported by `@object-ui/react` beside
    `ElementDataSourceGate` for discoverability; call sites take the core import,
    because a registration runs at module scope and this repo's suites partially
    mock `@object-ui/react`.
  - Seventeen renderers, in thirteen files across twelve packages, reach the seam
    and now publish the key to the save gate, the parser whitelist, the generated
    JSX authoring types and the block list. The card named nine blocks; the tree
    also has `plugin-grid`, `plugin-timeline`, two further `plugin-form` blocks and
    `element:record_picker` — nothing was hand-listed, so the mechanism covered
    them. `element:record_picker` consumes the gate's HOOK and status panels rather
    than the wrapper tag (its object lives under `properties`), and was found by a
    render probe rather than by reading sources.
  - `dataSource` on a block that does NOT read it (`flex`, `card`) still reports
    `unknown-prop`. Adding the key to `sdui-parser`'s `BASE_PROPS` was refused for
    exactly this reason — that set mirrors `BaseSchema`, and silencing the key
    everywhere would make the diagnostic lie in the other direction.
  - New `check:element-data-source-declaration` fails any source that consumes the
    gate without reaching the seam, so a block added tomorrow cannot forget.
  
  Behaviour of the binding itself is unchanged — this is a declaration, not a
  resolution change. The saved view still resolves its columns, and an
  unresolvable `view` still fails loudly rather than widening to the object's full
  scope.
  
  The spec/registry parity gates (repo-wide and the `record:related_list` per-block
  pin) now derive their accepted set from the WHOLE node contract rather than from
  `ComponentPropsMap[type]` alone. `PageComponentSchema` accepts and keeps
  `dataSource` on a page-component node — it is a node-level key, a sibling of
  `type` and `className`, not a per-block prop — so the gates' previous complaint
  was measurably wrong. Derived from the spec, not exempted, and both still
  discriminate against an invented key.
- 045d20b: Relationship-target readers resolve a lookup's target from `reference` alone,
  dropping the `reference_to` fallback arm (objectui#6837, half 2).
  
  Maintainer ruling, 2026-08-31, 原文照录: 「objectui不是前端的项目吗?后端的元数据只要
  对,前端按协议执行就行了呀」. Protocol normalization belongs on the SERVER; the front
  end just executes the protocol. objectstack#13847 landed the server half — a
  `field-reference-to-alias` conversion rewrites stored `reference_to` to
  `reference` on the serve path and in `os migrate meta`.
  
  `reference` is the only target spelling `@objectstack/spec`'s `FieldSchema`
  declares. Measured on the installed 17.2.0: it refuses `reference_to`,
  `referenceTo` and `target` with `unrecognized_keys`, each carrying its own
  "Did you mean -> `reference`?" rename, while a nonsense key gets the same
  refusal with NO rename hint and `reference` parses clean.
  
  ## ⚠️ BREAKING for a hand-written schema that spells `reference_to` — read this
  
  **This is a behaviour change for BYO consumers, and it is being stated rather
  than shipped silently.** ObjectUI is usable without an ObjectStack backend
  (`examples/byo-backend-console`), and a hand-written TypeScript schema passes
  through no zod door, so nothing rejects the legacy spelling at authoring time.
  
  **The break surface is narrower than "all BYO consumers", and this is the
  measurement rather than a blanket claim.** Two ingestion choke points stamp both
  snake_case keys from whichever spelling arrived — `MetadataProvider`'s type
  cache for metadata type `object`, and `ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema`. Any
  def that passed either one already carries `reference` and is **completely
  unaffected**. What is affected is exactly:
  
  - **A `DataSource` implementation other than `ObjectStackAdapter`.**
    `getObjectSchema` is a required member of the published `DataSource`
    interface, and the readers call it on the generic `dataSource` (through
    `useSettledSchema` and directly), so a host adapter's object schema reaches
    them raw. Every in-repo example of one is on this path:
    `ApiDataSource`, `ValueDataSource`, `packages/types/examples/rest-data-source.ts`,
    `examples/byo-backend-console/src/mockDataSource.ts`,
    `packages/runner/src/lib/mockDataSource.ts`,
    `apps/site/app/components/galleryDataSource.ts`,
    `apps/console/src/sdui-workbench-preview.tsx`,
    `packages/plugin-grid/demo/bulk-actions.tsx`.
  
  **Measured on this tree, none of those eight emits a relationship target at all** —
  `reference_to` and `reference` are both zero in each, and
  `examples/byo-backend-console` carries no lookup or master_detail field
  anywhere (its only `reference` hits are a vite triple-slash directive and a
  tsconfig `references` array). The single in-repo producer that WAS on this
  surface, `packages/plugin-gantt/demo/main.tsx`, is fixed here at the producer.
  
  ⇒ **If you author object metadata by hand and spell a lookup's target
  `reference_to`, rename that key to `reference`.** Symptom if you do not: the
  target silently fails to resolve, and the affected surface degrades rather than
  erroring — a related list is not derived, a gantt quick filter falls back to the
  distinct values in the loaded rows instead of the referenced object's full
  domain, a tree stops auto-detecting its parent pointer, a lookup cell shows a
  raw id, a chart's group-by labels stay unresolved.
  
  The ingestion choke point now emits a **dev-mode warning** when a def arrives
  carrying only `reference_to` or `referenceTo` and no `reference`. It names the
  object, the field and the offending key, and points at this ruling. Stamping is
  deliberately unchanged, so nothing that worked stops working. It is memoised
  once per **(object name, field name, spelling, target value)** — every segment
  of that key is pinned, in both directions, in
  `reference-keys.legacyWarning-6837.test.ts`.
  
  ⛔ **This warning does NOT cover the break described above, and it is worth being
  exact about that rather than letting it read as mitigation.** It lives in
  `normalizeFieldReferenceKeys`, reachable only through
  `normalizeSchemaReferenceKeys`, which has exactly two production call sites —
  `MetadataProvider` (metadata type `object`) and
  `ObjectStackAdapter.getObjectSchema`. Both of those also STAMP the def, so the
  warning fires precisely where the def still resolves and nothing is broken. A
  hand-written schema served through any OTHER `DataSource` — the break surface —
  reaches a reader raw: it never passes through this code and produces **no
  warning at all**. On that path the failure is exactly as silent as before.
  A reader-side or shared-resolver diagnostic, which would cover it, remains open
  on objectui#6837.
  
  ## What did NOT change
  
  **Every key these readers EMIT is byte-identical**, and that was verified
  mechanically over the whole diff rather than asserted. Eleven of the sixteen
  sites write a target onto a bag whose own contract spells it `reference_to` (or
  camelCase `referenceTo`): the six whose read and write share a line —
  `RecordDetailDrawer`, `RelatedList`, `buildDefaultPageSchema`, `ListView`,
  `FilterConditionField`, `resolveActionParams` — plus five more that read on one
  line and emit on another, and so are just as much emitters: `RecordDetailView`,
  `RecordMetaFooter`, `ObjectGallery`, `fieldEnrichment` (all `reference_to`) and
  `UserFilters` (`referenceTo`). Only the right-hand read narrowed anywhere; the
  emitted key is what its target contract declares, and renaming it would be a
  separate change.
  
  **Three readers were deliberately left alone.** `LookupCellRenderer`
  (`fields/src/index.tsx`), `LookupField` and `UserField` read `FieldMetadata` —
  ObjectUI's OWN contract, whose `LookupFieldMetadata` declares `reference_to` and
  never declares `reference`. They are fed by the emitters above and by published
  example schemas (`examples/schema-catalog/src/schemas/fields-lookup/*.json`), so
  narrowing them would break in-repo producers, and `plugin-grid`'s
  `relationalMetaCopySet.derivation.test.ts` re-derives its read set from exactly
  those three sources — where `reference_to` is recorded with verdict
  `adapter-stamped`. `DetailViewFieldSchema` is likewise untouched.

  A dataset-bound chart's aggregate axis / legend title read the analytics
  service's hard-coded English `Count` on a zh console whose category labels were
  already Chinese. The renderer was passing `fields[].label` through verbatim —
  correctly, for an author-declared measure (objectui#4106) — and had no way to
  tell the server's built-in default apart from an author's label.
  
  The wire now can: `AnalyticsResult.fields[]` gains an OPTIONAL structural
  discriminator, `builtinAggregate?: 'count' | 'sum' | 'avg' | 'min' | 'max' |
  'count_distinct'`, populated only on the server-side built-in defaults
  (objectstack#14492). This change is the consumer side of that contract:
  
  - `@object-ui/core`: `buildChartSeries` now accepts `ChartMeasureField[]` —
    `ChartResultField` plus the optional `builtinAggregate` carrier
    (`BuiltinAggregateCarrier`), declared beside the renderer shape rather than
    on it because the spec this release is built against does not carry the key
    yet; new `BUILTIN_AGGREGATES` / `BuiltinAggregate` / `isBuiltinAggregate` /
    `resolveMeasureLabel`; `ChartSeriesOptions.builtinAggregateLabels` carries
    the locale strings in (core stays React-free and i18n-free — the same
    division as `nullCategoryLabel`). A field carrying a recognised
    discriminator resolves through that map; every other field keeps its wire
    `label` verbatim — never by matching the label's text or the field's name
    (the rejected option A).
  - `@object-ui/i18n`: `builtinAggregateLabels(tt)` resolves the six strings
    through the existing `report.aggregate.*` keys (zh already carried 计数 /
    求和 / 平均 / …; all ten packs are pinned to cover the vocabulary).
  - `plugin-charts` (`ObjectChart`), `plugin-dashboard` (`DatasetWidget`),
    `plugin-report` (`DatasetReportRenderer`): pass the resolved map to
    `buildChartSeries`.
  
  Before: 合作中 / 已流失 / 潜在 under an axis titled `Count`. After: the same
  chart titled `计数`; an `en` session still reads `Count`; an author-labelled
  measure (`Tasks`) and a measure literally named `count` without the
  discriminator are byte-for-byte unchanged. Until the upstream field is
  populated the wire carries no discriminator and every chart renders exactly as
  before.
- 81a2eb1: One home for the `datetime` display convention (objectui#7443).
  
  `formatDateTime` gains a named `'compact'` style, selected through
  `options.style` — the dense grid face, `7/4/2024 7:00 am` in `en-US` — which
  `DateTimeCellRenderer` used to build from its own inlined `Intl` option bags.
  The cell now reads `field.format` (it destructured `value` only, so a
  `datetime` field could not reach the style vocabulary a `date` field has) and
  renders through the shared function, and `data-table`'s `formatCellValue`
  calls `formatDateTime` instead of a third, independently authored option bag.
  Every existing cell without an authored `format`, and every cell authoring
  `'compact'`, renders byte-identically; `'compact'` is today's face named and
  rehoused, not a new one. A `datetime` field that authors any OTHER non-empty
  `format` does change: the cell previously ignored `field` altogether and always
  painted the compact face, and now anything other than `'compact'` selects the
  verbose `formatDateTime` default — measured as `Jul 4, 2024, 07:00 AM` in
  `en-US` for the instant whose compact face is `7/4/2024 7:00 am`. An
  unrecognised value is neither rejected nor passed through; it silently lands on
  that verbose face. No `datetime` field in this repository authors a `format`, so
  no cell here moves — a consumer that authored one is the case this sentence is
  for. Note that `format` has no declared value vocabulary to check a value
  against: `@object-ui/types` types it `format?: string`, and `@objectstack/spec`
  carries one free-form `format?: string` on its shared field schema, described
  "Format string (e.g. email, phone)" and accepting any string. `'compact'` is
  therefore the only value with a defined `datetime` meaning, and every other
  value means "the verbose face" by fallthrough rather than by design.
  
  Additive, no signature change: `formatDateTime(value, options?)` is unchanged
  and `formatDateTime(v, { locale })` keeps meaning what it meant.
  `DateDisplayOptions` gains an optional `style` key (read by `formatDateTime`
  only; `formatDate` still takes its style positionally), and
  `formatDateTimeCompactParts` is a new export of `@object-ui/core`, re-exported
  by `@object-ui/fields`, returning the compact face as the two halves a grid
  cell paints separately. `@object-ui/components` changes no rendered output —
  the table's datetime cell is measured identical before and after in `en-US`,
  `zh` and `de-DE`.
- 00d2fa6: ListView: fold `data={{ provider: 'object', object }}` onto `objectName`, and read the
  author's view kind from `specType` / `type` (objectui#7477 — step 6 of #2890, released
  by the maintainer's ruling B on objectstack#14791, 2026-09-03).
  
  **What was broken.** A react page bound the way the published `react-blocks` contract
  recommends —
  
  ```jsx
  <ListView data={{ provider: 'object', object: 'crm_task' }} type="kanban" />
  ```
  
  — validated green against `@objectstack/spec` and then rendered an **empty grid** with no
  diagnostic. Both halves of that binding were inert in the renderer: `ListView` read
  `data.provider === 'object'` at zero sites (`'value'` and `'api'` are both live there, so
  the gap was real and not a dead instrument), and it read `specType` — the slot the react
  page tier parks an author's `type` in, because the SDUI envelope claims the `type` key
  (ADR-0078) — at zero sites, so an absent `viewType` forced the view to `grid`.
  
  **What changed.** `normalizeListViewSchema` (`@object-ui/core`) gains two folds. Per
  AGENTS.md #0.1 they live in the one documented normalizer — not as a seventh per-block
  copy of the six sibling `data.object` reads, and not as a renderer-side `??` dual-read.
  
  - `data: { provider: 'object', object }` → `objectName`. The `object` provider is a
    `strictObject` carrying exactly `{ provider, object }`, so `objectName` captures all of
    it. Two deliberate departures from the folds around it, both narrowing: an
    already-present `objectName` **wins** (the fold only fills a gap and can never re-point
    a binding that already resolves), and `data` is **not** deleted — it has four
    providers, `api`/`value` are read live, and the block is forwarded to child views whose
    own `getDataConfig` reads `data` before `objectName`.
  - the author's view kind is read from `specType`, then from a bare `type` when it names a
    kind ListView draws (the component discriminator `'list-view'` never does) — the same
    two legs, in the same order, as `normalizeChartSchema`'s chart-family read. An explicit
    `viewType` still wins; this only fills the gap that used to resolve to `grid`, and a
    kind ListView does not draw is left to that `grid` default rather than written through.
  
  **Accept behaviour widens.** Metadata that previously had no effect now binds a view: a
  list view carrying an `object` data source, or an author `type`, renders differently
  after this change than before. Nothing that renders today renders differently. No
  authored spelling is removed here — `objectName` / `viewType` remain accepted; their
  retirement is objectstack's, after this ships.
- e62c44e: Re-home the breakpoint layout vocabulary and delete the two dead responsive
  implementations (objectui#7580, maintainer ruling 2026-09-04, option A).
  
  **Breaking, deliberately, in one direction only.** `@objectstack/spec` retired its whole
  `ui/responsive` vocabulary in objectstack#11027 — `ResponsiveConfigSchema`,
  `BreakpointName`, `BreakpointColumnMapSchema` and `BreakpointOrderMapSchema` — on the
  stated ground that the four types "had no other authorable carrier". That ground is
  measurably false on the renderer side: `responsive-grid` is a REGISTERED SDUI component
  whose authorable `columns` input is typed by `BreakpointColumnMap` and applied by
  `resolveColumnClasses` on the render path, and `BreakpointName` types four live readers in
  `@object-ui/mobile`. The tombstone's own return condition — the vocabulary "returns if and
  when a renderer implements it" — is already met here, so the two types a renderer reads
  are re-homed rather than retired.
  
  What survives, under the same names and the same members:
  
  - `BreakpointName` (`xs`…`2xl`) is now declared in `@object-ui/types` (`mobile.ts`) instead
    of re-exported from the spec. **No consumer change**: same name, same six members, same
    export sites on `@object-ui/types` and `@object-ui/mobile`. Only its provenance moved.
  - `BreakpointColumnMap` is now declared in `@object-ui/layout` (`ResponsiveGrid.tsx`),
    verbatim from the retired `$strict` schema: six optional column counts, no index
    signature. `responsive-grid`'s `columns` input and its resolver are unchanged.
  
  What is removed:
  
  - `BreakpointOrderMap` (`@object-ui/layout`) — retired with the key, not re-homed. It had
    no read point in the package; it was published only because the retired
    `ResponsiveConfigSchema` paired it with the column map, so an author configuring `order`
    needed the type. With the schema gone there is no order vocabulary for it to be the type
    of, and re-declaring it would be the declare-without-enforce shape ADR-0049 removes.
  - `useResponsiveConfig` (`@object-ui/mobile`), with its `SpecResponsiveConfig` and
    `ResolvedResponsiveState` exports, and `ResponsiveProtocol` (`@object-ui/core`), with
    `resolveResponsiveConfig` / `getVisibilityClasses` / `getColumnClasses` /
    `getOrderClasses` / `shouldHideAtBreakpoint`. Both read the retired
    `ResponsiveConfigSchema` and both were measured at zero callers (objectui#4773).
  - `SpecResponsiveConfig` / `SpecBreakpointName` (`@object-ui/types`) — dead re-exports once
    the two implementations above went, dropped rather than re-declared locally, the same
    disposition the retired i18n names in that file already carry.
  
  No behaviour is retired. The live per-breakpoint readers — `useBreakpoint`,
  `ResponsiveContainer`, `BREAKPOINTS` / `BREAKPOINT_ORDER` / `getCurrentBreakpoint`, and
  `responsive-grid` itself — are untouched.
  
  **Sequencing.** objectui's next `@objectstack/spec` pin bump must carry `Blocked-by:`
  objectui#7580: the retirement is merged upstream and unreleased, so this must land first.
- b041b9c: `@object-ui/core` publishes `resolveRecordSourceObjectName`, the ONE reader for "which
  object is this block bound to" (objectui#7627).
  
  Six view plugins each spelled that resolution locally — `ObjectCalendar` twice,
  `ObjectGantt`, `ObjectTree` twice, `ObjectMap`, `ObjectGrid` — and had drifted: three
  wrote `?? schema.objectName`, one `|| ''`, one `: undefined`, one an `'object' in
  dataConfig` test. They now delegate to one function that states the published
  objectui#6939 record-source ladder (`data`, then `staticData`, then `objectName`) once.
  
  **No behaviour changes.** Each site's pre-collapse expression is transcribed verbatim
  into `record-source.behaviourNeutrality-7627.test.ts` and asserted equal to its
  post-collapse spelling across the whole contract-valid input matrix — both bindings
  present, data only, `objectName` only, empty `objectName`, empty `data.object`, the
  `api` / `value` / `staticData` / array-shorthand providers, and nothing bound.
  
  **Two questions stay two questions.** `normalizeListViewSchema`'s gap-fill (#7477,
  ruling B of PR #7628) is untouched and is NOT re-pointed at the new reader: it answers
  how `objectName` gets POPULATED when absent, where an already-present `objectName` wins.
  The new reader answers which object a block RESOLVES, where the `data` block wins — the
  order declared on both published faces in `@object-ui/types` and pinned by
  `objectql-record-source-refinement-6939.test.ts`. Merging them would silently override
  one standing ruling or the other.
  
  **`ObjectGantt`'s `persistLayoutKey` is deliberately excluded** and keeps its inverted
  order, with an in-place comment saying why: its receiver is a localStorage key
  (`gantt-layout:KEY:filters`), not a record source, so re-pointing it would orphan every
  saved layout and filter-chip set of a view carrying both bindings. Two more sites the
  finding listed are not object-name readers at all and were struck: `ObjectGantt`'s
  refresh-handler predicate (`object` OR `api`) and `plugin-dashboard`'s `isObjectProvider`
  type-guard over a widget's `data`.
  
  `useSettledSchema`'s doc comment stops prescribing the hand-written ladder at all four
  lines that taught it, so the copies cannot re-seed from the hook that replaced them.
- ce2aaef: One shared record-source ladder, five plugins delegate (objectui#7632).
  
  `@object-ui/core` publishes `resolveRecordSourceConfig(schema)` — the ONE implementation
  of the ruled three-rung record source ladder: `data` first, then `staticData` wrapped as
  `{ provider: 'value', items }`, then `objectName` folded to `{ provider: 'object' }`, and
  `null` when nothing is bound. It is the PRODUCER whose output the objectui#7627 reader
  `resolveRecordSourceObjectName` consumes, and it now sits beside it in the same module.
  
  That ladder is published contract on both faces — `packages/types/src/objectql.ts` and its
  zod mirror both ship `.describe()` strings naming `getDataConfig`'s order (objectui#6939,
  maintainer ruling 2026-09-02), pinned by `objectql-record-source-refinement-6939.test.ts` —
  and it was hand-copied into five plugin components with no gate holding them together. A
  change to the ruled order had five edit sites and nothing that noticed a missed one; that
  is the AGENTS.md #0.1 drift class.
  
  **No behaviour changes.** `ObjectCalendar`, `ObjectGantt` and `ObjectTree` now call the
  shared reader directly. `ObjectGrid` and `ObjectMap` keep their own bare-array `data`
  shorthand as a documented head above the shared call and are otherwise unchanged.
  `record-source-config.behaviourNeutrality-7632.test.ts` transcribes all five pre-collapse
  bodies verbatim and asserts the post-collapse spelling agrees with each across the whole
  input matrix, so a later edit to the shared reader that moves any site turns red.
  
  **Two divergences were measured rather than assumed, and both are preserved.**
  
  `ObjectCalendar`'s `'data' in schema && schema.data` guards exist because its parameter is
  the union `ObjectGridSchema | CalendarSchema` and `CalendarSchema` declares neither key.
  That is a TypeScript narrowing device with no runtime effect — an absent property reads
  `undefined`, falsy either way — so the guard could never change which rung is taken. The
  shared reader's optional-property parameter accepts the union directly, and the
  equivalence is pinned on a fixture that really lacks both keys rather than argued.
  
  `ObjectGrid` and `ObjectMap` normalize a bare-array `data` to `{ provider: 'value', items }`;
  `ObjectCalendar`, `ObjectGantt` and `ObjectTree` do not, and return the array verbatim. That
  is a real divergence on off-contract input — `ViewData` is a discriminated union over object
  variants, so an array under `data` cannot be published. It is NOT unified here: the shared
  rung stays contract-strict and the two sites keep the head locally, the same way objectui#7627
  left the off-contract `{ provider: 'object' }` tails at their sites. Both sides of the fork are
  pinned, so neither folding the head in nor deleting it as redundant can happen silently.
  
  `ObjectTree`'s copy took `schema: any`; it now goes through the shared reader's typed
  parameter. Types are erased at runtime, so nothing it resolves moves.
- d7573b3: `ComponentInput` is now declared once and re-exported, instead of restated in three
  places (objectui#4972).
  
  `@object-ui/core`'s `ComponentInput` (`registry/Registry.ts`) and `@object-ui/types`'
  plugin-scoped `ComponentInput` (`plugin-scope.ts`, published as `PluginComponentInput`)
  were structural copies of the interface in `@object-ui/types`' `base.ts`. Both are now
  re-exports of that one declaration, which is the disposition objectui#4580 ruled for the
  identical shape — *a structural copy would reproduce the defect the moment either side
  moved* — and the way `core/src/types/index.ts` already handles `SchemaNode`.
  
  Either side had already moved. `base.ts` declared thirteen keys; both copies declared
  nine, so `min` / `max` / `step` / `placeholder` were missing from **the copy every
  component registration actually imports**. Those four keys were unwritable at any real
  registration — a plain TypeScript error at the call site — while `ComponentInputSchema`
  (the zod schema) and `ComponentMeta.inputs` both accepted them. The publication face
  advertised four keys the authoring face rejected. Measured over the repository, no
  registration had tried to write one yet, so nothing a user hits was broken today; what
  changes is that the four keys become writable, and there is no longer a second
  declaration for the next widening to miss.
  
  `ComponentInput`'s arm vocabulary (`ComponentInputControlType`) was already a single
  declaration imported by all three sites (objectui#3832); this converges the rest of the
  interface.
  
  Measured, not assumed: `@object-ui/core`'s published entry `dist/index.d.ts` is
  byte-identical across the change (sha256 `f6494f80…`, both legs). That gauge is reported
  here only with its control — a probe that added a *required* key to `ComponentInput` left
  the same file byte-identical, because `dist/index.d.ts` is a 63-line barrel of
  `export *` lines that names `ComponentInput` zero times. The gauge that can actually fail
  is the emitted declaration file: `dist/registry/Registry.d.ts` changes, as does
  `@object-ui/types`' `dist/plugin-scope.d.ts`, and those two files are the *only* emitted
  declarations that change in either package.
  
  `WidgetInput`'s union-arm capability is deliberately untouched — a different gate path
  and a separate judgment.
- bf3edfe: `ComponentRendererProps` is now declared once and re-exported, instead of
  hand-declared a second time in `@object-ui/core` (objectui#4594).
  
  `@object-ui/core`'s `ComponentRendererProps` (`src/types/index.ts`) was a
  non-generic interface typing `schema` as `SchemaNode`, while
  `@object-ui/types`' declaration of the same name is generic —
  `ComponentRendererProps< TSchema extends BaseSchema = BaseSchema >` with
  `schema: TSchema`. Same name, both exported from their package entry, from two
  packages the same consumers import together: which declaration a call site got
  depended on which package it reached for, and the two disagree about whether a
  primitive node is admissible. Core's is now a re-export of types', which is the
  disposition objectui#4580 ruled for `SchemaNode` two lines above it in the same
  file, and objectui#4972 for `ComponentInput` — *a structural copy would
  reproduce the defect the moment either side moved*.
  
  **Published-surface effect, and the reason it is not neutral.** Resolved
  through the TypeScript checker from `core/dist/index.d.ts` over a clean rebuild
  of both legs, `ComponentRendererProps` as reached through `@object-ui/core`
  moves from non-generic with
  `schema: BaseSchema | string | number | boolean | null | undefined` to
  `ComponentRendererProps<TSchema>` with `schema: TSchema`, defaulting to
  `BaseSchema`. `schema` therefore **narrows** back to the object form — core's
  copy had silently widened when objectui#4608 made core's `SchemaNode` a
  re-export of types' union — and the type gains a parameter. **Nothing imported
  it**, on either side, re-verified repo-wide on the merged ref, so no call site
  can observe either move; the narrowing is recorded here because it is a change
  to a published type, not because a consumer is affected.
  
  A compile-time pin now holds the reconciliation from
  `@object-ui/react` — the only position that resolves both packages through
  `node_modules` — alongside the existing `SchemaNode` one. It is a test-only
  addition and emits nothing, so `@object-ui/react` takes no bump of its own.
- 5aed9e4: `DataScopeManager` now **denies** a row when a scope rule names something that is not the record's own data, and when an ordered comparison would only succeed by coercing one of its two sides. It used to **admit** those rows.
  
  Two fail-opens on a row-level permission boundary, both measured against the previous release's source, both the same silent direction as objectui#7378 — a result set that is too large, with no error and no console line, which looks exactly like a correctly configured permissive scope.
  
  **The field a rule names is now read as an own member of the record, or not read at all.** `{ field: 'constructor', operator: 'ne', value: anything }` returned the ENTIRE dataset: the name resolved on the prototype chain, `Function !== 'x'` is true, and every row passed the rule that existed to hide it. The read now has three cases instead of one. A name in the refused list (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`) denies. An own member is read as before. A name that is not an own member but still resolves on the record's prototype chain — `toString`, `valueOf`, `hasOwnProperty`, or a field inherited from an `Object.create` parent — denies, because the value exists but is not this record's data. A name that resolves nowhere is a genuinely absent field and still reads as `undefined`, so the ordinary "this row has no `status`" rules keep every verdict they have always had.
  
  That third case is deliberately stricter than `evaluateCondition` in `@object-ui/permissions`, which this card was filed to converge with. Reading with `hasOwnProperty` alone — the sibling's shape — collapses "inherited" into "absent", and absent ADMITS on a negative operator, so the sibling still returns `true` for `{ field: 'toString', operator: 'neq' }` on every record (filed as objectui#8044). Converging on the sibling's exact lines would have closed three spellings and left the class open, and would itself have widened one case: an inherited field value flips from denied to admitted under `ne`. Distinguishing inherited from absent closes the class and keeps the change a narrowing everywhere.
  
  **Ordered comparisons (`gt` / `gte` / `lt` / `lte`) now require both sides to be the same comparable kind.** `{ field: 'age', operator: 'gte', value: 0 }` admitted records whose `age` was `null`, `'10'`, `true`, `false`, `''` or `[]` — every one of them through a coercion to a number that the rule's author never wrote. Both sides must now be numbers, or both strings, or both `Date`s.
  
  Same KIND, not "both numbers". The sibling requires `typeof === 'number'` on both sides; copying that predicate would have denied every row for `{ field: 'created', operator: 'gte', value: '2023-01-01' }`, since ISO date strings, plain string ranges and `Date` objects all order correctly on this evaluator today and none of those comparisons coerces anything. The hazard is cross-kind comparison, so cross-kind is what is refused.
  
  **`contains` now requires its rule value to be a string** rather than calling `String()` on it, so `{ operator: 'contains', value: 1 }` no longer matches the record value `'10'`. Same unwritten coercion as the ordered arms; the sibling already refused it.
  
  **The narrowing, named plainly for anyone upgrading with rules already stored.** A legitimate rule loses rows in exactly three shapes. A numeric rule (`age gte 18`) over a dataset where numbers arrive as strings — from JSON, a CSV import, an unparsed form field — stops matching those records; `'20'` was admitted by coercion and is now denied, and the fix is to parse the field at the producer rather than to widen the rule. A rule reading a field that records inherit from a shared prototype rather than own stops matching. And a `contains` rule written with a non-string value stops matching. Measured over a 2772-case differential matrix of value kinds, operators and record shapes: 352 verdicts narrowed, **zero widened**, and zero change to the genuinely-absent-field family.
  
  Operator SPELLING is untouched, deliberately: `ne` / `nin` here versus `neq` / `not_in` in the sibling, and the sibling's `is_null` / `is_not_null` which this evaluator does not implement, remain exactly as they were. That divergence is objectui#7750's question.
  
  Graded `minor` because a release reader can observe the narrowing on stored data; no declared type changed and the set of inputs the evaluator accepts has not widened.
- 83c77dc: `DataScopeManager` now **denies** a row when a row-level scope rule carries an operator its evaluator does not implement. It used to **admit** the row.
  
  Behaviour change on a permission boundary, stated plainly. `evaluateFilter` implements nine operator spellings — `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `lt`, `gte`, `lte`, `in`, `nin`, `contains` — and its `default` arm returned `true`, so a stored `RowLevelFilter` carrying any other spelling passed every record the rule existed to hide, silently: no error, no console line, only a result set that was too large, which looks exactly like a correctly configured permissive scope. The arm now returns `false`, the answer `evaluateCondition` in `@object-ui/permissions` already gives from its own `default` arm. Because `applyFilters` ANDs a scope's rules, one unrecognised rule now denies every row in that scope.
  
  Who this reaches, measured on this release's base rather than assumed. The `RowLevelFilter['operator']` union is closed, so no TypeScript caller can write an unimplemented spelling, and no code in this repository constructs a `RowLevelFilter` outside the evaluator's own test. The path that changes is scope configuration read back from stored or hand-written JSON and handed to `setFilters` / `registerScopeWithConfig`, where the operator arrives as a plain string the type never checked. A deployment holding such a rule with a spelling outside the nine — including the spec's canonical `equals` / `not_equals` / `greater_than` / `starts_with` and the null-ness family `is_null` / `is_not_null`, none of which have an arm — sees fewer rows from that scope after upgrading, never more. Those spellings are not implemented here; they are refused instead of admitted. Whether to canonicalise them through the spec's `canonicalAstOperator` is left open on objectui#7378.
  
  Graded `minor` because a release reader can observe the narrowing on stored data; the declared type is unchanged and the set of spellings the evaluator accepts has not widened.
- e719ebd: `data-table` reads the declared `header`; the producers translate `label` into it.
  
  `TableColumn` declares `header: string` and does not declare `label`. The
  renderer's column normalization nonetheless read `header: col.header || col.label`,
  so the same key had one spelling the type admits and one only the runtime did.
  That alias is gone (objectui#5351), and the translation it used to perform happens
  once at each producer instead: metadata vocabulary in, adapter vocabulary out.
  
  **This narrows what `data-table` accepts, so read this if you author `data-table`
  nodes by hand.** A column spelled `{ label: 'Stage', accessorKey: 'stage' }` on a
  directly authored `data-table` now renders a **headerless** column over live
  cells. Spell it `header` — the key `TableColumn` has always declared. Columns
  reaching `data-table` through `object-data-table`, `object-grid` or a related
  list are unaffected: those producers resolve `header` for you from the spec's
  `ListColumnSchema.label`, so every spelling they accepted before they still
  accept.
  
  `@object-ui/core` gains `columnHeader()` alongside `columnIdentity()` — the reader
  producers use to cross that boundary. It is adapter-first (`header` wins over
  `label`), so an author who addressed the table directly is never overwritten.
  
  `object-data-table` also gains a fix from the same move: a column carrying a
  `label` used to render a **blank** header there even while the alias existed,
  because the widget's field-meta enrichment overwrote the authored `label` before
  the adapter ever saw it. `{ field: 'stage', label: 'Stage' }` now renders "Stage".
  
  The sibling `accessorKey: col.accessorKey || col.name` alias is **unchanged** here
  and still resolves. Retiring it is objectui#5120's remaining step, which is
  gated on two published skill guides that teach that spelling.
- fa429cf: The register-meta key `defaultChildren` is retired (objectui#5051).
  
  It was declared in four places, produced in eleven, and read in **none**. The designer's
  drop path builds a new node from its twin key only — `PageDesigner.tsx`,
  `props: paletteItem?.defaultProps ?? {}` — with no `children:` line, so a palette item
  that declared `defaultChildren` dropped an **empty** node and the declared children never
  materialised. Nothing rendered the wrong thing; an entire declaration surface was simply
  inert, which is the declared-but-unenforced shape ADR-0049 targets. Per the maintainer
  ruling of 2026-08-19, the key is removed rather than wired up; if designer
  default-children UX is ever product-wanted it returns as its own designed card.
  
  **If you author plugins against the published register-meta table, drop the key.** It is
  gone from `skills/objectui/guides/plugin-development.md`, which had been teaching it. A
  meta that still declares it stays *valid*: `ComponentMetaSchema` is a plain `z.object`,
  and measured on zod 4.4.3 that STRIPS unknown keys rather than rejecting them — so the
  key is silently dropped from the parse output instead of failing validation. TypeScript
  authors get the loud signal instead: all three `ComponentMeta` declarations
  (`@object-ui/types` `base.ts` and `plugin-scope.ts`, `@object-ui/core` `Registry.ts`) no
  longer offer it, so re-declaring it is now a compile error.
  
  **No runtime behaviour changes in either direction.** No code path read the key before
  this change, and the eleven producers that set it (`sidebar.tsx` x10, `span.tsx`) were
  feeding a reader that did not exist. Dropping a `span` or any of the ten sidebar types
  into the designer produces exactly the node it produced yesterday.
  
  Two suites keep it retired, one per package: `packages/types` pins the zod twin (the key
  is absent from the parse output, with a surviving sibling asserted present through the
  same parse as the control) plus the two TS twins with `@ts-expect-error`, and
  `packages/core` pins the registration surface the eleven producers were written against.
  Both are compile-time-enforced through each package's chained `tsconfig.test.json`.
- 105f3c5: Retire `CRUDSchema` and the `type: 'crud'` node spelling (objectui#5373,
  maintainer ruling 2026-08-20, route 2) under ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove.
  
  `crud` had four declaration faces and no registered renderer, for the whole
  life of the key: the TS interface (`packages/types/src/crud.ts`), the zod
  mirror (`packages/types/src/zod/crud.zod.ts`), a dedicated branch in
  `validateSchema` that affirmatively PASSED it, and `CRUDBuilder` in
  `@object-ui/core`. A node spelling it painted the OBJUI-001 "Unknown component
  type" panel, and `content/docs/api/schema-reference.md` published it as
  reference material — so a reader (or an AI author) who copied the page got a
  red panel.
  
  Removed from `@object-ui/types`: the `CRUDSchema` interface and its zod
  mirror, the four shapes that existed only to type its keys — `CRUDOperation`,
  `CRUDFilter`, `CRUDToolbar`, `CRUDPagination` and their zod mirrors and
  `…SchemaType` aliases — and `CRUDSchema` as a member of `CRUDComponentSchema`,
  which is what took it off the node union `AnySchema`. `ActionSchema`,
  `DetailSchema` and `CRUDDialogSchema` are unchanged and remain the union's
  members.
  
  Removed from `@object-ui/core`: `CRUDBuilder` and the `crud()` factory.
  
  Authoring `crud` is now REFUSED BY NAME rather than passed or silently
  ignored. `validateSchema` returns an `error` with `code: 'RETIRED_TYPE'` on
  `schema.type` — at any depth, since it is what `validateChildren` recurses
  with — so `assertValidSchema` throws and `isValidSchema` answers `false`. The
  message names the migration: `object-grid` for the record table with its
  toolbar, filters, pagination and row/batch actions, `object-form` for the
  create/edit form, and `detail` for the record view. `api/schema-reference.md`
  is rewritten around those shapes.
  
  Note on blast radius: the repository itself contains zero authored `crud`
  nodes and zero registrations of the key (measured on the merge base against
  the doc gate's own 659-key registry derivation, which reads `register` and
  `registerLazy` alike). That is an IN-REPO zero, not an npm zero — a published
  consumer that imported the `CRUDSchema` type, called `crud()` / `CRUDBuilder`,
  or authored `type: 'crud'` will see a compile error or a validation error
  respectively. Both are the intended, loud replacement for a shape that has
  never rendered.
- 83fe6e7: row predicates on runtime record surfaces resolve `record.*` only; the bare-field and `data.*` spellings are no longer bound
  
  Phase 2 of the row-predicate canon (objectui#5330, ruled 2026-08-20, option B;
  Phase 2 ruled 2026-09-02 and amended 2026-09-05 on objectui#5741). Until now a
  row predicate — `visible` / `disabled` / `enabled` on an action renderer, a row
  action, a `record:alert`, a `page:header` action, a conditional-formatting
  `condition` — bound the row three ways: canonical `record.status`, bare
  `status`, and `data.status`. The two non-canonical spellings are retired on
  every runtime record surface, in both evaluation tiers (`evalRowPredicate` /
  `partitionRowsByPredicate` in `@object-ui/core`; `usePredicateRecordContext` +
  `useCondition` in `@object-ui/react`) and for both dialects: a legacy
  `${data.x}` / `${x}` string on a row surface retires with the CEL spellings.
  
  **What a retired spelling does now: it faults, exactly as it already did on the
  server** (`buildScope({ record })` mounts exactly `['record']`, so `status` and
  `data` are unknown variables there), and each surface applies its EXISTING
  fault policy — no runtime detector, no "treat as absent" special case, no
  uniform override:
  
  - `evalRowPredicate` / `partitionRowsByPredicate` (row kebab, selection bar,
    `page:header` actions, conditional formatting): the caller's `fallback` —
    hidden / every row excluded / no style — reported once by the existing fault
    warning, which names the unknown variable (`Unknown variable: status`) and,
    on the fast route, carries the `record.` hint.
  - `useCondition` legs that opt into `throwOnError` (`action:button` and
    `action:menu` `visible`, `DeclaredActionsBar` `visible`): fail-closed —
    hidden on every row, reported once as `was hidden/disabled: its predicate
    threw — status is not defined`.
  - the non-throwing `useCondition` legs (`action:icon` / `action:group`
    `visible`, every `disabled` / `enabled`, `record:alert`): fail-soft — shown /
    greyed / enabled on every row, with the evaluator's own console line.
  - a host scope that carries its OWN `data` (app-shell's ambient `data: {}`) is
    left standing: `data.*` on a record surface then reads the host's object — a
    constant, silent `false` — which is what "no longer bound to the row" means.
  
  The Phase-1 deprecation warning is removed with the bindings:
  `warnNonCanonicalRowSpelling` and `resetRowPredicateCanonWarnings` are no
  longer exported from `@object-ui/core`. `detectNonCanonicalRowSpelling`,
  `ROW_PREDICATE_CANONICAL_ROOT` and the `NonCanonicalRowSpelling` type stay
  exported — the offline instrument for sweeping authored metadata.
  
  The layer rule is unchanged: `data` remains the canonical root on
  metadata-editing surfaces (ADR-0089 D3, `CANONICAL_ROOT_BY_LAYER`), and
  app-shell's metadata-admin `SchemaForm` / `predicate.ts` keep binding
  `{ data: row }` through their own evaluator.
  
  No stored-metadata survey, export or migration rewrite was run (the maintainer
  ruled the stored population out of scope, 「不考虑存量」); the Phase-1 warning
  period was the notice.
  
  Release note: Phase 1 (PR #5737 — the canon statement plus the warning) shipped
  in `@object-ui/core@17.6.0` (npm, 2026-08-24) although its changeset
  `.changeset/row-predicate-record-canon-5330.md` is still pending on `main`, so
  the next CHANGELOG section lists Phase 1 and this Phase 2 together: the warning
  it describes was live from 17.6.0 and is gone from this release on.
- d1ab06f: Row predicates declare a canon: `record.*`. The bare shorthand and `data.*` now
  warn once, and are unchanged otherwise.
  
  A row predicate (`visible` / `disabled` / `enabled` on an action renderer, a row
  scope, a `record:alert`) has bound the row three ways since objectui#4075 —
  `record.status`, bare `status`, and `data.status` — without any of them being
  declared the contract. The maintainer ruled that question on 2026-08-20
  (objectui#5330, option B), mirroring the objectstack#7917 option-② precedent for
  the identical renderer-tolerance shape: **the canon is `record.*`**, and the
  other two enter a deprecation window.
  
  The canon states the **server's** accept set, which was this card's first
  measurement and turns out to be strictly narrower than the renderer's. Measured
  against `@objectstack/formula@17.1.0`, the engine the server evaluates with:
  
  | spelling | server runtime | server authoring oracle |
  |---|---|---|
  | `record.status` | `{ ok: true, value: true }` | accepted |
  | bare `status` | `Unknown variable: status` | refused |
  | `data.status` | `Unknown variable: data` | **silently accepted** |
  
  `buildScope({ record })` mounts exactly `['record']` — `data` is never bound and
  the row's fields are never flattened to top level. The three-way binding is a
  client tolerance with no server counterpart, which is why the warning belongs on
  this side.
  
  `data.*` is the dangerous one, and the reason the warning exists. `data` is in
  `@objectstack/formula`'s `SCOPE_ROOTS`, so the server's bare-identifier oracle
  waves it through — that list is a deliberately generous "never faults" lint
  baseline, not the runtime accept set. A `data.*` row predicate therefore passes
  every authoring gate the platform has and then binds nothing at runtime: not an
  error, a constant `false`. A `visible` that is constantly false is a button that
  silently never appears — the objectui#4075 fail-closed signature.
  
  What ships:
  
  - `@object-ui/core` exports `detectNonCanonicalRowSpelling`,
    `warnNonCanonicalRowSpelling`, `resetRowPredicateCanonWarnings` and
    `ROW_PREDICATE_CANONICAL_ROOT` from a new `evaluator/rowPredicateCanon.ts`,
    which carries the canon statement and the measurement.
  - Both evaluation tiers report once, in dev: `evalRowPredicate` (core) and
    `useCondition` (react, for bags bound by `usePredicateRecordContext`).
  - Detection reuses the server's own oracles (`collectCelRootIdentifiers`,
    `firstUndeclaredReference`) rather than a regex, so no second dialect
    judgement is invented client-side.
  
  **No spelling is removed and no behaviour changes.** Every predicate that
  resolved before resolves now — the ruling defers removal behind a stored-metadata
  survey, and the warning is what makes that survey possible (ADR-0078: a
  tolerance nothing ever reports can never be retired).
  
  The deprecation is scoped to the **runtime record layer**. `data` remains the
  canonical root one layer over, in a metadata-editing form (ADR-0089 D3
  `CANONICAL_ROOT_BY_LAYER`), and the detector stands down there.
- 91783c4: Three more secret-field spellings no longer render a secret in clear text on the form's unregistered-widget branch.
  
  Measured on `main` at `f2e11ae6f`, the real `form` renderer on the built-in path
  (no `registerAllFields()`), before and after objectui#5322's fix:
  
  ```
  type            registry hit   rendered type
  ui:password     true           text
  secret          false          text
  field:secret    false          text
  ```
  
  Two halves, per the maintainer ruling of 2026-08-20:
  
  - **`@object-ui/core` — an unresolvable namespaced widget id is now an authoring
    ERROR.** A form field's widget id (`widget`, else `type`) may name the
    `field:` namespace or a bare name; any other namespace resolves no field
    widget (objectui#5254) and used to degrade silently to a plain text box.
    `validateSchema` now reports `UNRESOLVABLE_FIELD_WIDGET_NAMESPACE` and
    `assertValidSchema` throws. Behaviour change: a schema that previously
    validated with e.g. `type: 'ui:password'` is now invalid — inventing a
    plausible-looking widget id fails loudly instead of rendering clear text.
    `field:` ids stay valid whether or not the widget is registered, since
    registration is a runtime fact an authoring-time validator cannot see.
  - **`@object-ui/components` — the known secret types cover the remaining
    spellings.** Bare `secret` and `ui:password` render the native masked input,
    and `field:secret` is refused outright like `field:password`. Existing authors
    need no migration.
  
  `ui:password` **is** registered — as an SDUI node renderer for a top-level
  `{ type: 'email' }`-style node — so an author who checked whether it resolved
  got a yes and still got a clear-text box on the field path. No producer emits
  any of the three; all are reachable only through a hand-authored standalone
  form schema, which is exactly the surface where the author is the producer and
  no normalizer sits in between.
- 2d36552: Pins `@objectstack/spec`, `@objectstack/client`, `@objectstack/formula` and `@objectstack/lint` to `17.1.0`, and adapts the two consumer surfaces the new build moves.
  
  The pin itself is a lockfile refresh — every manifest already declared `^17.0.0`, which admits `17.1.0`, so no dependency range changed. All four move together: a split resolution is what produced the dual-version spec graph that reddened `check:spec-symbols` in this repo's history.
  
  **A `icontains` filter now reaches the driver as a filter.** `icontains` is a canonical `VIEW_FILTER_OPERATORS` member as of `17.1.0`, so an author can declare it on a `ViewFilterRule` and the spec validates it — but `@object-ui/data-objectstack`'s alias table had no row for it, and an unmapped operator is how this adapter shipped an unfiltered query before (objectstack#3948). It is an identity row like `contains`: `icontains` is itself a member of `VALID_AST_OPERATORS`, so the spelling the author writes is the spelling the AST takes, and no case-sensitivity is translated away. Declared rather than left to the table's `?? op` fall-through, on the rule its own parity test states — the AST gate accepting a spelling is not the driver compiling it into a `WHERE` clause.
  
  The same operator reaches the list view's own bridge: `@object-ui/plugin-list`'s `mapOperator` gains an explicit `icontains` arm. The emitted spelling is identical to the input, but the arm is written out rather than left to the `default` passthrough — `icontains` is its own member of `VALID_AST_OPERATORS`, so a raw passthrough is accepted *today*, and depending on that coincidence is what the bridge's own parity test records as how it once stopped discriminating.
  
  `@object-ui/core` adds `onSuccess` to its spec key inventory, so an author writing the key `17.1.0` now declares is no longer warned that it is unknown. That is a diagnostic statement only — the four declared action surfaces still drop the key before it reaches the runner, which is tracked separately.
  
  **A stored view filtering case-insensitively still shows that operator when it is reopened.** `@object-ui/plugin-view`'s canonical-to-builder table is keyed by `ViewFilterOperator`, so `17.1.0` adding `icontains` failed to compile rather than letting the operator reach the FilterBuilder as a raw spelling its dropdown cannot select. It maps to the builder's `containsCaseInsensitive` — the id that authors the spec's `$icontains` — and deliberately not to `contains`, which would quietly rewrite a case-insensitive filter into a case-sensitive one the next time the view was saved.
  
  **The page-editor palette keeps one entry per renderer.** `17.1.0` retires `element:filter` from `PageComponentType` and adds `record:discussion`, leaving the member count at 34 either side — so the swap is invisible to any count-based reading. The stale `element:filter` exclusion is dropped, and `record:discussion` is excluded because it is the *same renderer* as the already-offered `record:chatter`, not because it is unauthorable. Nothing the palette offers changes.
  
  **The console eager-closure ceiling is re-baselined, by maintainer ruling.** The release is roughly 930 KB larger uncompressed and nearly all of it lands in `vendor-objectstack-*.js`, which put the closure past a ceiling that was deliberately sized to catch a 89 KiB regression — the gate refused the bump, correctly. Raising it was escalated rather than taken locally, because gate-strength policy had been ruled the maintainer's; the ruling on objectui#5531 authorised the raise. `MAX_EAGER_CLOSURE_GZIP_BYTES` and the `BASELINE` it is derived from move together in one commit, keeping headroom at 2.00% and below the 91,136-byte regression size the gate must still catch. The gate's *sensitivity* is untouched: a repeat of that regression from the new baseline still fails. No behaviour ships from this file — it is CI policy, recorded here because the version it governs is the one this changeset publishes.

### Patch Changes

- 9801765: The selection bar's built-in **Delete** now honours `userActions.delete.visibleWhen`
  per selected record (objectui#4420). It used to read that key as a bare boolean — the
  object-level verdict only — so ticking a record the author's predicate excludes still
  offered the red Delete, and pressing it deleted the record the predicate was written to
  protect. The row kebab on the same screen hid its Delete correctly, so one declared key
  meant two different things on two surfaces.
  
  Ruled by the maintainer on 2026-08-17 (behaviour 1 of the card's three): **filter the
  operation and report the skipped**. The bar evaluates the predicate once per selected
  record, the delete runs over the allowed subset, and the excluded records are reported
  rather than silently dropped. The button itself is never hidden or disabled by the
  predicate — a mixed selection is not punished for one stray tick — and a selection where
  every row is excluded is a legible refusal rather than an unexplained absence.
  
  - `@object-ui/core` gains `partitionRowsByPredicate`, the set-shaped counterpart of
    `evalRowPredicate`: the fail-closed per-record fold a bulk gate needs, written once.
    A bulk gate evaluates N records in a loop, which is why it can never be a hook.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-grid`'s bulk bar routes an excluded selection through
    `BulkActionDialog`, whose existing `bulk-skipped-notice` slot reports the skipped
    count; a selection with nothing excluded keeps the consumer's own delete flow
    untouched. `resolveRowCrudAffordances` now also returns `objectDeletePredicates` —
    the bulk half of the same predicates, gated on the object verdict rather than on the
    row `onDelete` wiring. The dialog declines to run over zero records.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-list`'s non-grid bulk bar (kanban / calendar / gallery / …) filters
    the built-in `delete` to the eligible subset and states the skipped count inline.
  
  Custom bulk action ids are untouched: they route through the action runner carrying
  their own gates. This is a UI affordance — server enforcement was never the leak.
- 546ddf7: A node-gate visibility predicate that FAULTS now says so in a production build, once per
  distinct predicate source (objectui#6038, maintainer ruling 2026-08-25, option B: "the
  silence is no longer an accepted property"). Observability only — no verdict moves.
  
  `SchemaRenderer`'s visibility chain is fail-open: a predicate that cannot be evaluated
  resolves to the same answer as one that said yes, so a gate that stops biting looks
  exactly like a gate the author got right. The diagnostic that names it (objectui#5454 /
  objectui#5687) sat behind a `__DEV__` short-circuit, because the only fault-detection
  channel available was `throwOnError`, and on the CEL branch `evaluateCelCondition`
  implements that by evaluating **twice** — too expensive to ship for every predicate of
  every node.
  
  **What production actually printed before, measured per dialect on the built evaluator**
  — the card's premise held for one dialect of three, and the other two failed in opposite
  directions:
  
  | dialect | production console, before |
  |---|---|
  | bare string | **nothing** |
  | `{ dialect: 'cel' }` envelope | one generic line, deduped per source |
  | `${…}` template | one generic line **per evaluation**, never deduped |
  
  So the dialect objectstack#11254 measured a live gate breaking on was the silent one,
  while the template dialect was the console flood the ruling's rate-limit clause exists to
  prevent.
  
  **The fix reports the fault the evaluator already detected, at the same number of engine
  calls.** `EvaluationOptions.onFault` is a new passback on `@object-ui/core`'s
  `ExpressionEvaluator`: every fault site is already inside a `catch`, or already holds the
  canonical engine's failure reason, so nothing is evaluated twice. It mirrors, one layer
  up, the seam `FieldPredicateDiagnostic` already documents (`warn: false` plus a reason
  passback), and supplying it transfers reporting to the caller so one fault stays one
  line. Pinned: the CEL branch performs the same number of record reads with the passback
  as without it, and strictly fewer than the `throwOnError` probe.
  
  `SchemaRenderer` passes it in production and reports through the **same** reporter the dev
  branch uses — same message, same severity, same dedupe `Set`, same key. Development and
  production now print the identical line for the identical fault; the `__DEV__` gate no
  longer decides *whether* a fault is reported, only *how* it is detected.
  
  `page:tabs` item-level `visibleWhen` (`@object-ui/components`) is covered by the same
  reporter and the same rate limit. It swallowed the identical fault under a different
  helper, and it was the worse of the two: the node gate at least reported in development,
  while a faulting item predicate was silent in *both* builds on a gate whose false verdict
  removes an entire tab, header and panel.
  
  **Rate limit:** deduped per (node type, gate key, predicate source) — never per render and
  never per node instance. A two-hundred-row list of one broken predicate is one line; a
  second distinct predicate source still gets its own line. Both halves are pinned, because
  a test that asserts only "a warning was emitted" is equally green on an implementation
  that emitted fifty, and one that asserts only "exactly one" is equally green on an
  implementation that suppresses everything.
  
  **Not changed by this card, deliberately:** the fail-open semantics themselves; the
  objectui#5687 adapter-only `data.*` report, which stays development-only under its own
  2026-08-22 ruling (that path is not a fault — the predicate evaluated perfectly, against
  the wrong object); and the `/forms/:name` scope wiring of objectui#6262, which lands in
  its own PR.
  
  `reportUnresolvableVisibilityPredicate`, `formatUnresolvableVisibilityMessage`,
  `UNRESOLVABLE_VISIBILITY_PREFIX` and `__resetVisibilityPredicateWarnings` are now exported
  from `@object-ui/react` so every surface that evaluates a node `visibleWhen` shares one
  reporter and one rate limit — a second copy would mean a second dedupe `Set`, and one
  authored predicate would be entitled to one line per package instead of one line.
- a26b9e4: `packages/core/src/adapters/README.md` now documents the adapters that are actually in that
  directory, and the ObjectStack material it carried moved to the package that owns the behaviour
  (objectui#6213). Both files ship to consumers — `@object-ui/core` publishes its `src/`, and a
  README rides every tarball — so this was published documentation describing the wrong package.
  
  The page had been left behind when the ObjectStack adapter moved out to
  `@object-ui/data-objectstack`: its headings, feature list, filter-operator table and
  query-parameter table were all about that adapter, and its one-entry "Available Adapters" list
  told a reader Object UI has exactly one adapter and that it comes from `@object-ui/core`.
  `ApiDataSource`, `ValueDataSource`, `resolveDataSource`, `runBatchTransaction` and
  `emulateBatchTransaction` — the five exports that directory really ships — were named nowhere.
  
  - **`@object-ui/core`**: the page now opens with what the directory holds, gives each export a
    usage snippet and a `provider` mapping, and points at `@object-ui/data-objectstack` for the
    ObjectStack adapter. `## Creating Custom Adapters` is unchanged — it is the one section that was
    always about this directory.
  - **`@object-ui/data-objectstack`**: gains a `## Query Translation` section carrying the
    filter-operator and query-parameter mapping tables, the AST conversion example and the sorting
    example. That material existed **only** in the `core` copy — this package's README documented
    query translation as a single feature bullet — so it is ported, not dropped.
  
  No runtime behaviour changes; the duplicate copy of one package's documentation living under
  another package is what goes away.
- 3c2b6f7: Two deprecation warnings pointed at `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`, a file deleted from the
  repository in `8c5d20455` (objectui#6342).
  
  `Registry.register()`'s missing-namespace warning now points at the live docs page
  that documents namespaced registration
  (`/docs/guide/plugin-development#namespaced-registration`) instead of the deleted
  guide. `ValidationEngine`'s function-based-condition warning drops its `See:` line
  entirely: the deleted guide covered component namespaces and lazy field
  registration and never documented conditions at all, so that pointer was
  misdirected as well as dead, and the warning already carries the complete
  before/after migration inline.
  
  Both are console messages shipped to application developers, so neither can use
  the immutable `git show <sha>^:<path>` provenance form objectui#6275 used for a
  docblock — a reader of the npm package has no repository to run it against.
- 5961030: `@object-ui/core` and `@object-ui/data-objectstack` now declare
  `"@objectstack/spec": "^17.2.0"` rather than `^17.0.0`, which is the lowest published
  spec that carries every symbol each package's own build output references
  (objectui#6361).
  
  `packages/core/dist/utils/column-sortability.d.ts` references
  `FIELD_SORTABLE_UNPROVISIONED_ANCHOR`, `FIELD_UNSORTABLE_VIRTUAL_TYPE`,
  `FieldSortability` and `ObjectSortability` from `@objectstack/spec/api`, and
  `packages/data-objectstack/dist/index.js` references the first two — none of which
  `@objectstack/spec@17.0.0` exports. Measured against the published tarballs rather than
  the installed tree, by `scripts/check-spec-range-floors.mjs`: six `floor-too-low`
  findings across the two packages, and `^17.2.0` is that gate's own computed answer for
  both. So the old range was a claim neither package could honour: any consumer
  resolution that lands 17.0.0 — a sibling pinning it exactly, an `overrides` entry, a
  mirror two minors behind — satisfied `^17.0.0` and got a dangling reference.
  
  Nothing a consumer installs today changes: normal resolution already picks the newest
  17.x, and `pnpm-lock.yaml` still resolves `17.2.0` on both edges after the bump — only
  the recorded `specifier:` moves. No source and no behaviour changes, which is why this
  is scored `patch`, on the reasoning objectui#5793 used for the same remediation on
  `@object-ui/plugin-detail`.
  
  The bump is release-blocking rather than cosmetic. `check:spec-floors` is deliberately
  not a `pull_request` job, so every PR stayed green while its blocking copy on the
  publish path — `pnpm changeset:publish` runs it before a single tarball reaches npm —
  would have cancelled the next release.
- 299102e: `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluate` now reports a faulting `${…}` at most **once per authored
  source** instead of once per evaluation (objectui#6444). It is the hottest of the three
  predicate paths in this area — `SchemaRenderer` calls it for every `properties.*` value,
  every `props.*` value and `content`, for every node, on every render — so a single broken
  `${…}` prop in a 200-row list wrote 200 console lines per render, and 200 more on the next
  one. Measured on the built evaluator before the fix: three identical faulting
  `evaluateCondition` calls produced 3 lines where the `{ dialect: 'cel' }` envelope produced
  1; the 200-row list produced 200. After: 1 in every case.
  
  This is the one-per-source rate limit both sibling reporters already carry
  (`warnPredicateFailure` in `fieldRules.ts`, `visibilityDiagnostic.ts` in `@object-ui/react`),
  not a third mechanism. The dedupe key is the predicate's **authoring** identity — the fault
  site plus the source text, never the scope it ran against — which is both the siblings'
  precedent and the defect itself: the 200-row flood is one authored source evaluated against
  200 distinct scopes, so a scope-sensitive key would emit all 200 lines again.
  
  Nothing else moves. The two message texts are unchanged, a distinct broken source still gets
  its own line, `EvaluationOptions.onFault` still fires on every fault (objectui#6038's passback
  contract, so a caller doing its own warn-once bookkeeping keeps control of it), `throwOnError`
  still throws on every evaluation, and no symbol is added to the published surface.
- 831be72: Dev-mode `validateSchema` no longer reports every expression-valued `visible` / `disabled`
  gate as an invalid schema (objectui#6505). `BASE_SCHEMA_RULES` declared both keys
  `typeof value === 'boolean'`, so the exact authoring form the docs teach —
  `{ "type": "button", "disabled": "${record.stage == 'closed'}" }` — printed
  `disabled must be a boolean` and its host element got `data-obj-schema-invalid`, the cue
  apps are told to hang a red outline off.
  
  **The accept set widens to what the protocol already declares and the runtime already
  accepts, not beyond it.** `AGENTS.md` §4 declares both keys as expressions, `SchemaRenderer`
  evaluates them through `hasDeclaredPredicate` + `evaluateCondition`, `@objectstack/spec`
  normalizes every authored predicate into a `{ dialect, source }` envelope, and the
  objectui#3862 / objectui#3955 rulings are entirely about which expression spellings count
  as declared. This table was the one place in the repo that disagreed, so this restores
  declared = enforced rather than changing a contract.
  
  **The rule still bites, and that half is pinned separately.** The two keys stay in
  `BASE_SCHEMA_RULES`: a number, `null`, `{}`, an array, `''`, whitespace-only predicate text
  and the empty / blank-`source` envelope (objectui#3960) are all still reported at their own
  path with `INVALID_TYPE`. Every one of those was reported before this change too — the
  accept set is a strict superset of the old one, so nothing that validated stops validating
  and nothing refused becomes accepted. The message now names both halves of the accept set
  instead of only the half that did not change.
  
  The verdict is delegated to `hasDeclaredPredicate` (`evaluator/declaredPredicate.ts`), the
  repo's single definition of "is a predicate gate declared on this value?"
  (objectui#3850's ruling), rather than answered a second time in the validator — a
  hand-rolled twin that agrees today and drifts tomorrow is the defect class this rule was
  already an instance of. `packages/core/src/validation/__tests__/predicate-valued-gate-rules.test.ts`
  pins the delegation behaviourally: the rule's verdict must equal
  `boolean || hasDeclaredPredicate(value)` across every probe in the file.
  
  The explicit boolean arm is kept even though `hasDeclaredPredicate` already subsumes it, so
  the superset relationship is provable locally: a future narrowing on the declaredness side
  cannot silently start reporting `disabled: false` — the most explicit gate an author can
  write — as an invalid schema.
  
  The zod `safeValidateSchema` surface (`@object-ui/types/zod`, objectui#6318) is a different
  validator and is untouched.
- d0889e2: Resolve a relationship target from `reference` only — the spec spelling
  (objectui#6528).
  
  `resolveReferenceTo` (dataset designer) and its sibling
  `resolveRelationshipTarget` (`chart-series.ts`) each read a relationship field's
  target through a four-spelling tolerant chain — `reference ?? reference_to ??
  referenceTo ?? reference_to_object`. Measured against every producer that can
  reach them, three of the four are unfounded, so the chain is narrowed to
  `reference` in BOTH places in one pass (they must not diverge — a fix leaving
  them disagreeing recreates the defect one file over).
  
  The census, with `reference` itself as the positive control every zero is
  measured against:
  
  | spelling | `ObjectSchema.safeParse` (spec 17.2.0) | producers on the object-metadata surface |
  |---|---|---|
  | `reference` | ACCEPTED | live — both designer writers emit it; 445 of 565 lookup/master_detail defs in the framework tree |
  | `reference_to` | REFUSED BY NAME | 0 (live only on ObjectUI's own view/field schema — a different contract) |
  | `referenceTo` | REFUSED BY NAME | 0 (producers retired by objectui#6041; stripped by the read door since objectui#6519) |
  | `reference_to_object` | REFUSED (not even an alias) | 0 anywhere in either tree, outside the chain and its own test |
  
  Behaviour change, and it is deliberate: `chart-series.ts` reads
  `GET /meta/object/:name` directly, with no read door stripping retired keys, so
  a stored pre-objectui#6041 row spelling the target `referenceTo` no longer
  resolves there. The walk is best-effort by construction — no entry is yielded
  and the caller keeps the raw value — so such a row degrades visibly instead of
  being silently absorbed. Per AGENTS.md #0.1 that row is a producer-side defect,
  and a lenient consumer is where it would have stayed hidden. `reference` was
  already head of the old chain, so any document carrying both is unaffected.
  
  The string / array / `{ object }` carriers are untouched: the carrier is a
  separate axis from the spelling and narrowing it needs its own census.
- 4d5f9b4: Resolve a relationship target from a `reference` STRING only — the carrier axis
  (objectui#6648).
  
  objectui#6528 narrowed both relationship-target resolvers to the single spec
  SPELLING `reference` and left the CARRIER — the shape the value may take —
  explicitly for its own census. That census is done, and it says the same thing:
  `resolveReferenceTo` (dataset designer) and its sibling
  `resolveRelationshipTarget` (`chart-series.ts`) each accepted three carriers on
  the canonical key, two of which `FieldSchema` never declared. Both are removed
  in BOTH files in one pass (they must not diverge — a fix leaving them
  disagreeing recreates the defect one file over).
  
  The measurement, with the bare string as the positive control every zero is
  measured against:
  
  | carrier | `ObjectSchema.safeParse` (spec 17.2.0) | producers at the field-def key position |
  |---|---|---|
  | `reference: 'crm_account'` | ACCEPTED | live — 587 across both trees |
  | `reference: ['crm_account']` | REFUSED — `expected string, received array` | 0 |
  | `reference: { object: 'crm_account' }` | REFUSED — `expected string, received object` | 0 |
  
  The census walked STRUCTURE, not text: JSON/YAML parsed and walked, TS/TSX read
  through the TypeScript compiler API, each hit recorded with its ancestor
  property chain and its enclosing object's sibling keys so a FIELD DEF is
  separated from the other tiers that also spell `reference` (a form field
  literally named `reference`, its translation entries, a JSON-Schema property
  descriptor, a liveness-ledger row). Every dynamic initializer at the field-def
  position resolved to a string-typed source, and every `reference` TYPE
  declaration in either tree declares `string`. The detector is not blind to the
  shape it hunted — it DID report array and `{ object }` carriers, and every one
  was a test asserting this very tolerance plus one framework lint fixture whose
  own rule already reads string-only.
  
  The array branch was also a silent PRODUCT decision: handed a multi-target
  value it returned element zero and DISCARDED the rest. Nothing declares such a
  value. Polymorphic lookup is an open, unbuilt gap in the spec's own audit report
  ("Current `reference` only supports a single target", Tier 3), and the
  platform's one polymorphic reference (ADR-0018 `xRef`) is a STRING with a
  sibling discriminator, never a list. A multi-target lookup, if it lands, lands
  as a declared spec shape — not as a carrier a consumer guesses at.
  
  Behaviour change, and it is deliberate: a field def whose `reference` is not a
  non-empty string now resolves to `undefined` in both helpers. Such a document is
  already refused by `ObjectSchema`, so per AGENTS.md #0.1 it is a producer-side
  defect, and a lenient consumer is exactly where it would have stayed hidden. The
  two unit assertions that pinned the tolerant reads are converted to refusal
  pins, so re-widening the carrier turns red.
- 48c19bd: Render a dataset measure over a date field as a date (objectui#7178, maintainer
  ruling 2026-09-02, director summon #8 — option A).
  
  `formatMeasure` opened with `if (typeof v !== 'number') return String(v)`,
  placed **before** `format` was ever read. So a `min` / `max` measure over a date
  or datetime field printed its stored value verbatim — a 24-character ISO string
  in the KPI tile's `text-2xl font-semibold`, wrapping to two lines — and the
  `format` that `DatasetMeasureSchema` accepts was unreachable for those values.
  A date-shaped value now routes to the date display path before that
  short-circuit, so all four dataset-bound surfaces are served at once: the metric
  tile, chart values, dataset table cells, and the metadata-admin dataset preview.
  
  `min` / `max` over a date stays a legal measure; nothing in `@objectstack/spec`
  narrows. `PivotTable` takes a `number` outright and is unchanged.
  
  **No second date formatter was written.** `formatDate`, `formatDateTime`,
  `formatRelativeDate` and `DateDisplayOptions` MOVED from `@object-ui/fields`'
  barrel down into `@object-ui/core` (`utils/date-display.ts`), which is the same
  remedy objectui#4576 applied to `formatDisplayNumber` and for the same reason:
  `core` is the React-free engine and could not import from a React package, so
  the alternative was a parallel date convention in `dataset-format.ts` — exactly
  the drift that once had a list cell rendering `1.234,5 %` beside a dashboard
  measure's `1.234,5%`. `@object-ui/fields` re-exports all four names unchanged,
  so no consumer's import path or behaviour changes, and a reference-identity test
  pins that the cell renderer and the measure formatter call the same function.
  
  **What `format` can say for a date measure, measured rather than assumed.** The
  shared date path takes a named STYLE, not a date pattern: `'short'` and
  `'relative'` are honoured — the same words `DateCellRenderer` honours from
  `field.format` — while a pattern such as `'YYYY-MM-DD'` renders the locale
  default. That limit is unchanged by this release (`plugin-dashboard`'s
  `recordFields` already routed a date-shaped `format` into the same style slot)
  and is now pinned by a test instead of being silent.
  
  **Numeric measures are byte-identical.** 33,696 argument forms
  (value × format × currency × percentScale × locale) were compared against a
  verbatim copy of the pre-fix function: the only values that moved were the four
  ISO-shaped, parseable ones. Numbers, numeric strings (`'1751612400000'`,
  `'2026'`), the nullish em dash, arbitrary prose and non-strings all render
  exactly as before.
- a6d8b8d: Fix: a grid grouped by a field it does not also show as a column no longer collapses
  every row into one `(empty)` group (objectui#7179).
  
  `$select` was built from the view's `columns` and nothing else, so a view declaring
  `grouping: { fields: [{ field: 'business_unit' }] }` on a field absent from its columns
  never asked the server for that field. It was `undefined` on every row by the time
  grouping ran, and the grouping label builder — correctly, for a genuinely empty value —
  answered `(empty)` for all of them. The result was one collapsible group holding every
  record, with no error, no warning and no empty state: a grid that looked like it grouped
  and did not, reading as "these records have no value for this field".
  
  The grouping fields are now unioned into the projection, at both places it is built —
  `ObjectGrid` when it fetches for itself, and `ListView` when it fetches and hands the
  rows down. Lookup grouping fields are unioned into `$expand` as well: a `select` that
  fetches a bare foreign key without populating it buckets by raw id instead of by name,
  which is a different wrong answer rather than a fix.
  
  Authors do not need to mirror a grouping field in `columns` any more. That was never
  required by `@objectstack/spec` — `grouping` is a sibling of `columns`, not a subset of
  it — and the neighbouring view kinds (kanban, gantt, timeline) already unioned their
  `groupByField` with no column needed. Refusing the configuration at author time was
  considered and rejected: it would make the grid the odd one out and reject working
  intent that the schema explicitly allows.
  
  The union is guarded, and the guard is as load-bearing as the fix. A `grouping.fields[]`
  entry carries a bare string that has never been through column validation, and some
  backends answer an unknown `$select` key with an empty result set rather than ignoring
  it. Unioned unguarded, a grouping field naming something the object does not declare
  would have turned this bug into a strictly worse one — no rows at all, equally silently.
  Grouping fields are therefore intersected with the object's declared fields and passed
  through the same field-level-security gate as columns and predicate operands before they
  reach the query.
- e75f4c9: `colorField` now means the same thing in the gantt, the calendar and the timeline
  (objectui#7243).
  
  **The inversion this fixes.** `gantt.colorField` is documented as "field that drives the
  bar color", and the renderer passed the stored value straight into the bar's
  `backgroundColor`. Pointing the key at a select field therefore emitted
  `backgroundColor: "open"` — not a colour, so the browser dropped the declaration and
  every bar rendered identically. OMITTING the key was strictly better: the absent-key
  branch derived a real colour per status. Declaring the documented key was worse than not
  declaring it, with no error, warning or console message either way.
  
  The same key also meant three different things across the three lenses: the timeline
  resolved the field's authored option `color`, the calendar hashed the raw value onto a
  fixed palette, and the gantt emitted the raw value. An author colouring three views by
  one field got three unrelated results, one of which was no colour at all.
  
  **The ladder.** `@object-ui/core` gains `createFieldColorResolver` — the timeline's
  resolver, lifted so all three call it:
  
  1. the field's own option `color` for the record's value;
  2. else the value itself when it already IS a colour literal (`#rgb`, `#rrggbb`,
     `#rrggbbaa`, `rgb(...)`, `hsl(...)`);
  3. else each renderer's own last rung, which is deliberately NOT shared — the gantt
     derives a semantic-token hex (a bar must be painted), the calendar keeps its
     theme-aware 8-stop hash (a soft tint, not a solid fill), the timeline draws its
     default marker.
  
  **What changes for authors.** A gantt or calendar whose `colorField` points at a select
  field with authored option colours now paints those colours. A gantt value that is
  neither an option colour nor a colour literal now derives a colour instead of emitting
  an invalid CSS value — including a palette NAME (`red`), which now resolves to that
  palette's hex, the behaviour the key's own contract has always promised ("hex or
  semantic name") and the one `borderColorField` already had. `gantt.borderColorField`
  takes rung 1 as well, so an authored option colour reaches the alert stroke; it keeps
  today's behaviour otherwise and deliberately gains no derivation rung, since the stroke
  is opt-in and deriving one for every record would draw an alert on records that have
  none.
  
  Calendars whose `colorField` points at a plain categorical field are unchanged: that
  value still reaches `CalendarView`'s deterministic hash exactly as before. The timeline
  is unchanged apart from accepting the 8-digit `#rrggbbaa` hex spelling the calendar
  already accepted.
- 19f1639: A synthesized default list view now always leads with the object's name field
  (objectui#7245).
  
  **The defect.** An object that declares no list view gets its default grid columns
  synthesized from `highlightFields`, taken verbatim. But `highlightFields` is ADR-0085's
  *"most important fields"* role, not a column list — and its first consumer, the
  detail-page highlight strip, **deliberately removes the title field**, because the page
  H1 directly above it already shows one. So metadata that is entirely correct routinely
  omits the record's name from `highlightFields`. The showcase `showcase_account` declares
  `nameField: "name"` and `highlightFields: ["status", "industry", "annual_revenue"]`, and
  its default `所有记录` grid rendered 14 rows whose columns were `#` / Lifecycle / Industry
  / Annual Revenue / actions — no name column, and no way to tell one account from another.
  
  A list has no H1 to lean on, so the same declaration needs the opposite treatment here.
  This is not a new convention: `deriveLookupColumns` in `@object-ui/fields` already leads
  its record-picker columns with the display field and filters it out of the declared list.
  The list faces now agree with it.
  
  **What changed.** `@object-ui/core` gains two exports on the ADR-0079 title ladder:
  
  - `resolveNameField(objectDef)` — *which field* titles an object: the declared
    `nameField` (then its deprecated `displayNameField` / `NAME_FIELD_KEY` aliases), else
    the type-aware derivation. The name-space twin of `getRecordDisplayName`, which answers
    what that field *says* on one record. Both now read one spelling of the declared
    pointer, so they cannot drift into naming different fields.
  - `leadWithNameField(objectDef, columns)` — moves that field to the front of a
    **synthesized** column list.
  
  All three faces that synthesize default list columns call it: `ObjectView`
  (`defaultListColumnsFromObject`), `InterfaceListPage` (`defaultColumnsFromObject`) and
  `ObjectGrid`'s own derivation. The name field is **moved**, not merely appended, so an
  author who lists it third still gets it first — "the column that identifies the row"
  means first. On the two capped faces the lead is applied *before* the 5 / 6-column slice,
  so an object declaring its name field late no longer loses it off the end.
  
  **Scope, deliberately narrow.** Author-declared column lists are untouched — a view or
  grid that declares `columns` / `fields` said what it wants, and reordering it would be
  renderer-side second-guessing of metadata. Three cases also decline to lead: a name field
  the object carries no field def for (never fabricate a column), one marked
  `hidden: true` (the author said don't show it), and a *derived* pick that lands on a
  system-managed column — `deriveTitleField` filters by type only, and leading a default
  list with a raw id is the regression objectui#2702 / #2777 fixed. A *declared*
  `nameField` pointing at a system field still leads: `sys_migration` really does point at
  `id`, and an explicit designation is not a heuristic misfire.
- c6198c2: **Breaking for authored metadata:** `ComponentInput.label`, `ComponentInput.defaultValue` and
  `ComponentInput.advanced` are RETIRED on both faces (objectui#7493 item ① and objectui#7781;
  maintainer ruling A of 2026-09-06, immediate, no deprecation window; ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).
  They are the three keys the manifest serializer does not forward, and nothing read them on any
  publication or consumption path.
  
  No manifest ever published them, so no consumer could ever have read them. `sdui-parser`'s
  serializer (`packages/sdui-parser/src/index.ts`) forwards exactly six keys per input — `name`,
  `type`, `required`, `enum`, `binding`, `description` — so a value authored under any of the three
  never reached `sdui.manifest.json`, the generated JSX `.d.ts`, or a diagnostic; its boundary type
  has no slot for them; the registry's data-source seam reads `name` only; and neither the designer
  nor the app-shell inspectors consult registry `inputs` at all. A structural census over every
  `inputs:` array in the repository (re-measured on this change's merge-base, `name` 951 and `type`
  951 as the controls) counted the writes: `label` 908, `defaultValue` 245, `advanced` 9 — written on
  nearly every registration, read by nothing.
  
  FROM → TO, per key — all three **TOMBSTONED, not removed**, because the route was measured on
  the built face before it was chosen: `ComponentInputSchema` is a non-strict `z.object`, and an
  undeclared key parses GREEN and is silently STRIPPED, so a deletion would have swallowed 1,162
  authored values in silence. The tombstone is what makes the refusal loud and by name.
  
  - `label?: string` → `label?: never` on the interface, `retirementTombstone()` on the Zod mirror.
    Migration: delete the key. An input is identified by its `name` on every path that reaches it;
    nothing ever rendered a label for it.
  - `defaultValue?: any` → `defaultValue?: never` / `retirementTombstone()`. Migration: delete the
    key. The renderer's own fallback read IS the default; tell the author about it in `description`,
    which IS published. (Tightening the type to `unknown` was ruled out: it closes no error class,
    since nothing reads the value.)
  - `advanced?: boolean` → `advanced?: never` / `retirementTombstone()`. Migration: delete the key.
    No designer surface ever hid an "advanced" input; there is nothing to write instead.
  
  The retirement kit: `?: never` on `ComponentInput` (`packages/types/src/base.ts`), so authoring one
  is a `tsc` error at the registration site; `retirementTombstone()` on `ComponentInputSchema`
  (`packages/types/src/zod/base.zod.ts`), so an authored value is REFUSED at parse time with
  `code: 'invalid_type'`, the key named in the issue `path`, and the migration note as the message
  (one string, both channels). Pinned in
  `packages/types/src/__tests__/component-input-retired-keys-7493.test.ts`, which also holds a
  tree-scoped absence census over every `inputs:` array under `packages/**` and `apps/**`.
  
  Accept-set change, stated plainly for reviewers: a document that sets any of the three keys on a
  `ComponentInput` used to parse GREEN (the value was then dropped by the serializer) and now parses
  RED. Every in-repo authoring site — 1,199 keys across 110 registration files, the three standalone
  `ComponentInput[]` arrays and the two named input arrays `tsc` found included — is deleted in the same change, as the ruling's split rule
  requires; the `WidgetRegistry` seam no longer copies the widget-manifest values onto the synthesized
  `ComponentInput` (they fed nothing), and the data-source declaration `ELEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_INPUT`
  drops its `label`. The patch entries on the other packages record exactly that: their registrations
  stop authoring inert keys, with no runtime or published-manifest change.
  
  The nine test files that read `defaultValue` off a registration were re-pinned against the
  renderer's ACTUAL default (its own fallback read, or the `defaultProps` it ships) instead of the
  declaration that went away; two assertions that only restated the shadow default were dropped with
  the reason on the line.
  
  The in-repo zero is what was measured. Whether anything OUTSIDE this repository writes these keys
  is not measurable from here (the objectui#5674 limit); converting such a write from a silent drop
  into a named refusal is exactly what the tombstones buy. `WidgetInput`'s own `label` /
  `defaultValue` / `advanced` (the widget-manifest face) stay declared and writable — nothing has
  ruled on that face; that it now has no reader either is recorded as objectui#7911.
- 52cac38: `formatDate` reads `options.style` (objectui#7745).
  
  `DateDisplayOptions` is the one bag `formatDate` / `formatRelativeDate` /
  `formatDateTime` share. `style` was added to it for `formatDateTime`'s `'compact'`
  grid face (objectui#7443, PR #7621) and only `formatDateTime` read it, so on
  `formatDate` the key was inert — and inert beside a POSITIONAL parameter of the same
  name. `formatDate(v, undefined, { style: 'short', locale: 'en-US' })` rendered
  `Jul 4, 2024`, the default face, with no diagnostic; it now renders `Jul 4, '24`.
  This is the additive half of the maintainer's long-run ruling on objectui#7443:
  both functions accepting `options.style`.
  
  **The precedence is pinned: the positional argument wins.** `options.style` is
  consulted only when the positional slot is `undefined` (`??`, not `||`, so `''`
  still counts as given). That is the only direction that is purely additive — it
  fires exactly on the input that is a silent no-op today, so no call that renders a
  face today renders a different one after. The reverse would let a key aimed at a
  SIBLING function outrank an argument written for this call: the bag is shared, and
  carrying `{ style: 'compact', locale }` built for `formatDateTime` into
  `formatDate(v, 'short', bag)` must not cost that call its short face.
  
  **What changes for you.** Only `formatDate(value, undefined, { style: 'short' | 'relative' })` —
  a call that silently rendered the default face before. Every call that passes the
  style positionally, and every `formatDateTime` / `formatRelativeDate` call, renders
  byte-identically to before.
  
  `formatRelativeDate` still does NOT read `style`; the ruling names `formatDate`
  only. Its out-of-window fallback to `formatDate` strips the key so that the new read
  cannot leak in through the delegation — which also keeps
  `formatRelativeDate(v, { style: 'relative' })` from recursing.
- 81c0bc4: The dev-mode unknown-key warning stops stating a fact that was retired, and
  sends the author to the file that actually declares the interface
  (objectui#5642).
  
  Both halves of the message's tail had outlived the change they described. It
  told the author the key was warned about rather than rejected because
  `ActionDef` "still carries `[key: string]: any`" — objectstack#4075 step 3
  deleted that index signature, and `actionKeys.pin.test.ts` pins the deletion in
  the opposite direction (`{ ActionDef: false, ActionContext: true }`), while
  `actionDef-closed-surface.test.ts` pins that `tsc` now rejects exactly such a
  key at the construction site. And it prescribed promoting the key to an explicit
  field on `ActionDef` "(packages/core/src/actions/actionKeys.ts)" — that file
  holds the INVENTORY (`ACTION_DEF_KEYS`); the interface is in `ActionRunner.ts`.
  The wrong pointer had teeth: an author who followed it edited the inventory
  alone, which is precisely the half-change the pin test reddens on, since it
  re-derives the inventory from the interface's AST.
  
  The tail now carries the reason the module's own header already gives for why
  this warning survived step 3 — the two mechanisms cover disjoint populations.
  `tsc` sees action literals authored in code; the warning sees actions that
  arrive as data, from stored rows that are rehydrated unparsed and that no
  compiler ever looked at (objectstack#3903). The prescription names
  `ActionRunner.ts` for the field and `ACTION_DEF_KEYS` as the same-commit second
  edit, saying why.
  
  No behaviour change: the classification logic, the key inventory and its
  derivation are untouched, and the warning fires on exactly the same actions as
  before. Two comments in the same file and two in the pin test that described the
  pre-step-3 world were refreshed in the same pass, and the message text is now
  pinned — the printed interface path is resolved off the message and read, so a
  move or rename reddens by name instead of shipping a second dead prescription.
- 8ebd57f: Both `evaluateExpression` references in the `ExpressionEvaluator.registerFunction`
  JSDoc are now qualified, so each resolves to the entity it means (objectui#5580).
  
  `ExpressionEvaluator.ts` declares two things spelled `evaluateExpression`: the method
  on `ExpressionEvaluator` (bare expression, throws) and the module-level export
  (context bag, fail-soft, delegating to `evaluate`). The `registerFunction` block
  referred to both under the one spelling, four lines apart.
  
  The prose link was not merely ambiguous, it was bound wrong. Measured with
  `checker.getSymbolAtLocation` on the pre-fix source, `{@link evaluateExpression}`
  resolved to the module-level `FunctionDeclaration` — the fail-soft one — inside the
  sentence that calls it *"the throwing sibling"*. The neighbouring `{@link evaluate}`
  binds to the method, but only because no module-level `evaluate` exists to outrank
  it, so the rule "an unqualified link resolves to the enclosing class's member" does
  not hold here. The link is now `{@link ExpressionEvaluator.evaluateExpression}`,
  which the checker resolves to the `MethodDeclaration`.
  
  The `@example`'s final line is the module-level export — its second parameter is a
  context bag and the `${...}` wrapper only resolves on the `evaluate` path — but it sat
  two lines below calls that establish `evaluator.` as the receiver, and a `.d.ts` hover
  carries no import to disambiguate. It now names the module-level export and shows the
  import it needs.
  
  This is prose only: the diff is confined to a block comment and no declaration moves.
  It is scored `patch` rather than the empty-frontmatter form because the block is
  emitted into what npm ships — measured, this edit moves both
  `dist/evaluator/ExpressionEvaluator.d.ts` and `dist/evaluator/ExpressionEvaluator.js`
  (this package builds with a bare `tsc`, which preserves comments in the JS emit), and
  the ten changed lines in that JS are all comment lines.
  
  `registerFunction-jsdoc-links.test.ts` pins the binding against the checker rather
  than asserting it in prose, since a `{@link}` that binds to the wrong entity is
  indistinguishable in source from one that binds right.
- 7138bc1: The dev-mode unknown-key warning stops flagging `overrideNotice`, the console's
  privileged-override safety copy (objectui#5611).
  
  `ActionRunner.execute` classifies the object it was HANDED, and a console host
  hands it a DISPATCH, not a stored metadata row. `DeclaredActionsBar` composes
  `overrideNotice` on that dispatch and two param-collection handlers read it —
  yet the key inventory only mirrored AUTHORED surfaces, so the runner reported a
  key two files read as one "no reader recognizes", and prescribed promoting it to
  an explicit field on `ActionDef`. That prescription is the one shape the
  2026-08-22 maintainer ruling forbids for this key, so acting on the diagnostic
  walked an author into a rejected design. A false warning on the product's own
  privileged path — the branch that finalises an approval over approvers who have
  not acted — is how a dev console gets muted.
  
  Adds an exported `HOST_DISPATCH_ACTION_KEYS` (sole member `overrideNotice`) to
  `actions/actionKeys.ts` and unions it into `KNOWN_ACTION_KEYS`, which is the
  fourth input to that set and the first one that is not an authored-surface
  mirror. Measured before and after on the exact dispatch the bar composes: the
  warning went from one call naming `overrideNotice` to none, `KNOWN_ACTION_KEYS`
  grew by exactly one member, and an action carrying a real typo alongside it
  still warns — naming `targt` only.
  
  The authored surface does not move. `overrideNotice` is still NOT declared on
  `ActionDef` and still NOT in `ACTION_DEF_KEYS`; writing it in an action literal
  remains a compile error, and the AST-derived pin over the interface is unchanged.
  Membership in `KNOWN_ACTION_KEYS` widens what the WARNING tolerates, never what
  an author may write — `actionKeys.pin.test.ts` now pins both halves, including
  the new list's exact contents so a second member cannot arrive quietly.
- cef27e2: The value-fallback label prettifier `humanizeLabel` has one implementation instead of two byte-identical copies.
  
  `humanizeLabel` turns a stored value into a display string when nothing else
  resolves it — an option with no declared label, an object name, a chart axis
  member. It existed twice, byte for byte: once in `@object-ui/fields` (read by
  `plugin-grid`, `plugin-gantt`, `plugin-detail` and by that package's own
  renderers) and once as a deliberate local copy in `plugin-charts`'
  `ObjectChart.tsx`, whose comment said it was there "to avoid a dependency on
  `@object-ui/fields`".
  
  Two copies of one convention is a live hazard rather than tidiness: one
  dashboard can hold a chart and a grid over the same stored value, so a change
  landing on one copy alone would put that value on screen under two spellings at
  once. The single implementation now lives in `@object-ui/core` — the shared
  ancestor both packages already depend on, so the dependency the copy existed to
  avoid is still avoided and no new edge is created, and core takes no React
  (objectui#4389: core-canonical logic, plugins consume). Both former sites
  re-export it, so `import { humanizeLabel } from '@object-ui/fields'` keeps
  working unchanged.
  
  **Nothing rendered changes.** The surviving implementation is byte-identical to
  both deleted copies, and each former call site is pinned by identity against the
  core function — not by a copied output table that someone would have to remember
  to edit in two places.
  
  The core module also writes down, for the first time, why this convention stays
  distinct from `humanizeFieldKey` (the KEY fallback, in `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard`),
  which additionally splits camelCase:
  
  ```
  input                humanizeFieldKey     humanizeLabel
  needs_analysis       Needs Analysis       Needs Analysis
  NeedsAnalysis        Needs Analysis       NeedsAnalysis        <- differ
  unitPrice            Unit Price           UnitPrice            <- differ
  BestCase             Best Case            BestCase             <- differ
  lost-to-competitor   Lost-To-Competitor   Lost To Competitor   <- differ
  ```
  
  A field KEY is authored in the codebase and carries a machine spelling, so
  splitting camelCase recovers words its author meant. A stored VALUE is arbitrary
  tenant data, where a mid-token capital is not reliably a word boundary and
  splitting it rewrites what the tenant wrote (`McDonald` to `Mc Donald`). The two
  conventions also do not nest — on the last row each leaves alone the separator
  the other rewrites. Whether they should ever converge is a separate decision
  that would move rendered output in four packages at once; it is deliberately not
  made here.
- af3861f: `normalizeListViewSchema` now folds the four per-view-type config aliases phase 3
  carried over — `kanban.groupField` → `groupByField`, `kanban.cardFields` →
  `columns`, `gallery.imageField` → `coverField`, `timeline.dateField` →
  `startDateField` (objectui#2890).
  
  These are the pre-#2231 objectui spellings, kept declared alongside the spec keys
  so stored view metadata would keep validating. They now fold at the same
  component boundary as the A1–A5 vocabulary folds, in the same one-directional
  shape: the canonical key wins when a config carries both, and the legacy key is
  removed from the result so a missed read-site fails loudly instead of quietly
  taking the legacy path.
  
  One rendering behaviour changes, and it is a correction of the same inverted
  precedence the `densityMode` fold fixed: `ListView`'s kanban adapter resolves the
  card field list as `cardFields || columns` — legacy over canonical — so a kanban
  config carrying **both** rendered the legacy `cardFields` value and silently
  ignored the spec-canonical `columns`. After the fold the authored `columns` is
  what reaches it. Configs carrying only one of the two are unaffected, and every
  other reader of these four keys was already canonical-first.
  
  `calendar.defaultView` is deliberately **not** folded: it aliases nothing and has
  no spec counterpart, so it wants promotion upstream rather than a rename.
- c00bf28: `getRecordDisplayName`: stop consulting the undeclared object-level
  `titleField`, restoring `nameField` as the top of the object ladder
  
  Step 0 of the unified record-title resolver read
  `options?.titleField ?? objectDef?.titleField`. The second leg ranked an
  object-level `titleField` above `nameField` — the pointer ADR-0079 Phase 2 made
  canonical — and above the deprecated `displayNameField` alias and the legacy
  `titleFormat` template.
  
  `@objectstack/spec`'s object schema does not declare that key, and it is not
  merely undeclared: the schema is a `strictObject`, so
  `ObjectSchema.safeParse({ …, titleField: 'x' })` fails with `unrecognized_keys`
  — the same code a nonsense key gets — while `nameField`, `displayNameField` and
  `titleFormat` all parse and survive. A producer census across both repos found
  nothing that puts the key on an object-shaped payload: not the metadata, not any
  `getObjectSchema` implementation (the ObjectStack adapter stamps only reference
  keys and field-widget hints), not the lookup-chip path, not the
  search-candidate path, and not the platform's own server-side resolver
  (`@objectstack/objectql#titleFieldOf` reads `nameField` → `displayNameField`).
  Reading a key no producer can ship is a consumer-side alias — the shape
  Commandment #0.1 bans — and it inverted the governed-authority default on top of
  that.
  
  No authoring surface changes and no view loses its author-chosen title field:
  `titleField` remains a real, declared VIEW key (`ui/CalendarConfig`,
  `ui/GalleryConfig`, `ui/GanttConfig`, `ui/ListMapConfig`,
  `ui/ObjectKanbanProps`, `ui/TimelineConfig`), views hand it in as
  `options.titleField`, and that half of step 0 still wins over everything.
  The behaviour change is confined to an object payload that carried a key the
  contract rejects: it now resolves through the declared ladder instead.
- f2158ec: `ExpressionEvaluator.registerFunction` now documents the case-fold it has always
  performed: the name is stored — and must be called — in UPPER CASE
  (objectui#5363).
  
  `registerFunction('formatCurrency', fn)` registers `FORMATCURRENCY`, because the
  method delegates to `FormulaFunctions.register`, which stores under
  `name.toUpperCase()`. That fold is correct for the spreadsheet-style built-in
  vocabulary (`SUM`, `IF`, `UPPER`) and is unchanged here — but nothing declared
  it on the public method, and two things keep it from being self-evident at the
  call site. The registry API stays case-insensitive, so `getFormulas().has()` and
  `.get()` both answer to the original spelling and never reveal the fold; only
  expressions see the stored key, because the evaluation scope is built from
  `FormulaFunctions.toObject()`, a plain object whose identifiers are matched
  case-sensitively. And a wrong-case call site does not raise: `evaluate()`
  catches, warns, and returns `defaultValue ?? expression`, so the template
  renders its own `${...}` source as literal text on screen rather than erroring.
  
  Behavior is untouched — this is the declaration catching up with what the code
  enforces. It ships as a patch rather than as an empty changeset because the
  JSDoc is emitted into the published `dist/evaluator/ExpressionEvaluator.d.ts`,
  so it is what consumers see on hover.
  
  `ExpressionEvaluator.test.ts` gains three cases pinning the half that was
  uncovered — that the given spelling does *not* resolve in an expression, that
  the failure renders the raw template source instead of throwing, and that the
  registry API stays case-insensitive underneath — so making registration
  case-preserving fails a test instead of silently invalidating the new JSDoc.
- 6c6cee7: A RETIRED field-type spelling is now refused — out loud, once — by every
  field-type predicate in the renderer, not just by the widget road
  (objectui#4914, maintainer ruling B of 2026-08-18).
  
  `@object-ui/fields` exports a single `isRetiredFieldType(t)` gate, and it runs
  ahead of six predicate faces that previously granted a retired spelling
  first-class treatment: the filter builder's operator buckets and its value
  control (`@object-ui/components`), the detail page's highlight-strip picker
  (`@object-ui/plugin-detail`), `normalizeFieldType` (`@object-ui/plugin-view`),
  the dashboard's `$expand` whitelist and `isLookupType`
  (`@object-ui/plugin-dashboard`), and the list toolbar's lookup-like filter
  control (`@object-ui/plugin-list`). Each one now fires the migration
  prescription on the console — once per spelling across all of them, never once
  per predicate — and then answers as it would for a spelling it does not
  recognise.
  
  This closes the whole CLASS rather than one word: the gate is quantified over
  `RETIRED_FIELD_TYPES`, so the next retirement covers all seven consumers on the
  day it lands. It is the shape objectui#4932 and objectui#4942 already
  established for the form and inline-edit roads.
  
  Measured before the change, and the reason the fix is a gate rather than a
  deletion: `owner` was not dead in these faces. `operatorsForFieldType('owner')`
  equalled the `user` bucket item for item, `computeLookupExpand` actively
  requested `$expand` for it, `isLookupType('owner')` was `true` alongside
  `reference`, and `normalizeFieldType('owner')` answered `'select'` exactly as
  `picklist` does. Deleting the members alone would have traded a visible
  contradiction for a SILENT degradation — a filter picker collapsing to a bare id
  box, `$expand` quietly stopping so cells show raw foreign-key ids — which is
  verbatim the failure mode `RETIRED_FIELD_TYPES`' own docblock exists to prevent.
  The gate keeps that fallback and adds the half that was missing: the author is
  told.
  
  The boundary question is answered on record: `owner` arriving through a
  backend-vocabulary normalizer is an authoring error to refuse loudly, not
  legitimate foreign input to tolerate. The open backend vocabulary those
  normalizers exist for is untouched — `reference`, `picklist`, `money`, `int`,
  `datetime_tz` and the rest are equally absent from the spec's closed `FieldType`
  and are equally unretired, so they classify exactly as before.
  
  `RETIRED_FIELD_TYPES`, `reportRetiredFieldType` and `resetRetiredFieldTypeReports`
  move to `@object-ui/core` and are re-exported from `@object-ui/fields`, so that
  package's published surface is unchanged apart from the newly ruled gate.
  `@object-ui/components` is a consumer of the gate and `@object-ui/fields`
  depends on it, so a single shared table could not live in `fields` — and a
  second copy would have meant a second dedupe set and two console lines for one
  spelling. No package gained a new dependency.
  
  A retired spelling never loses a stored value: `retypeFilterValue` is
  deliberately not gated, and the refused filter row stays operable rather than
  drawing a blank operator trigger.
- ed71d9e: Withdraw the entry-surface justification on core's `SchemaNode` re-export, and put
  the gauge that can actually fail in its place (objectui#5673).
  
  `packages/core/src/types/index.ts` carried, as the justification for the #4580
  re-export convergence, *core's own entry surface is unchanged (`dist/index.d.ts` is
  byte-identical across the change — measured, both rounds)*. The reading was real and
  it certified nothing. `core/dist/index.d.ts` is emitted from a barrel that only
  FORWARDS the symbol, and forwarding never restates a shape — not `export *`, and not
  the `export type { … }` line that names this one. Only the module that DECLARES the
  symbol can move, so that file is byte-identical under any change to a re-exported
  declaration's shape, and it could not have failed for the change class it was quoted
  against.
  
  Measured for this change rather than argued. One optional key was injected into
  `BaseSchema` — the shape `SchemaNode` publishes — both packages were rebuilt from a
  cleared `dist/` and a cleared `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, then the probe was dropped and
  both rebuilt again:
  
  | emitted file | base | with probe | probe dropped |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `@object-ui/types` `dist/base.d.ts` — declares the shape | `31b5a01d…` | `8487500e…` **moved** | `31b5a01d…` |
  | `@object-ui/core` `dist/types/index.d.ts` — forwards it | `0e64c8c6…` | `0e64c8c6…` | `0e64c8c6…` |
  | `@object-ui/core` `dist/index.d.ts` — entry barrel, names it | `5cca207a…` | `5cca207a…` | `5cca207a…` |
  
  The corrected block states that calibration as a recipe with its failure mode, so the
  next reader inherits a gauge that can be checked instead of a sentence that cannot.
  The `ComponentRendererProps` block below it already reached the right verdict, but
  gave a narrower reason for it — that core's entry is an `export *` barrel — which is
  not the mechanism, and is wrong for a symbol the barrel names on its
  `export type { … }` line; it now states the forwarding rule.
  
  Documentation only, in a published declaration file: these docblocks sit on export
  specifiers, so `core/dist/types/index.d.ts` carries them into the tarball, while
  `core/dist/index.d.ts` does not move for them either — the same insensitivity,
  demonstrated once more on this very change. No type moves and no runtime behaviour
  changes.
- 7776fc2: fix(core): `ValueDataSource` applies the filters it is given instead of returning every row
  
  `matchesASTFilter` recognised only two node shapes — a logical `and` / `or` head
  and a three-element comparison — and answered `true` for everything else. Three
  consequences, all silent: a legacy flat implicit-AND array (`[[…], […]]`) applied
  no filter at all, at top level and as a nested child of `and` / `or` alike; the
  null-ness operators had no arm, so `is_null` / `is_not_null` selected every row;
  and 16 of the spec's 20 canonical view operators — `equals`, `greater_than`,
  `starts_with` among them, the spellings `toFilterNode` lowers a stored view's
  rules into — fell through the same way.
  
  The matcher now canonicalises operators through the spec's own
  `canonicalAstOperator` and reads all four shapes `FilterArraySchema` declares, so
  an in-memory `provider: 'value'` list applies the same filter the wire would. An
  operator or shape it cannot execute now excludes the row and logs once per
  `find()`, rather than passing every row with no signal anywhere.

## 17.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 279fb13: `ComponentInput.type` can declare a UNION, so a block stops warning about legal
  writes its own description recommends
  
  A registration's `type` was one coarse control kind, while a good number of spec
  keys accept more than one shape. A declaration therefore had to pick an arm, and
  the repo's own manifest gate then reported `type-mismatch` on the other arm's
  legal values. Four of the five measured cases were the loud shape: the input's
  `description` teaches the author to write an inline translation map
  (`{ en, "zh-CN", … }`) while the same input's `type: 'string'` made
  `sdui-parser`'s `checkType` warn about exactly that map — one platform authority
  contradicting itself on the write it had just recommended. Because these land at
  warning severity the page still compiled and rendered; the cost is that noise on
  correct authoring trains authors, AI authors included, to dismiss the
  `unknown-prop` and `type-mismatch` reports that are real.
  
  `type` now accepts an ARRAY of coarse kinds as well as a single one (maintainer
  ruling on objectui#3832, direction (a)), and a value passes the coarse check when
  ANY declared arm accepts it. Both declaration sites in `@object-ui/types` move
  together with the registry's own copy in `@object-ui/core`, and
  `ComponentInputSchema` enforces the same widening — a non-empty array of
  DISTINCT kinds, so an empty arm list or a repeated arm is refused at authoring
  time rather than normalized behind the author's back.
  
  Five declarations now spell their real contract, and the `type-mismatch` warning
  on each of these legal writes is gone:
  
  - `page:header.title`, `page:header.subtitle`, `page:card.title` —
    string **or** inline translation map (the spec's union, measured against
    `ComponentPropsMap` at the pinned rc.6; the renderers resolve both through
    `pickLocalized`);
  - `record:alert.title`, `record:alert.body` — the same two shapes, justified
    against the RENDERER since the pinned spec carries no `record:alert` props
    schema;
  - `element:text_input.defaultValue` — `string | number`, the spec's union,
    which had been narrowed to `'string'` with the number arm named only in prose.
  
  **Backward compatible, and measured as such.** The single-kind form stays valid
  and is still the canonical spelling for a one-arm key: it validates identically
  (the diagnostics for one arm, `invalid-enum` and its `error` severity included,
  are byte-identical), and `manifestFromConfigs` collapses a one-element array back
  to the bare string, so every entry already in a published `sdui.manifest.json`
  serializes unchanged and arrays appear only where a union was really declared.
  The JSX authoring surface follows in the same step — `generateDts` emits a
  TypeScript union for a union input, so the `.d.ts` an author type-checks against
  accepts exactly what the gate accepts.
  
  A union widens what is legal; it does not switch the check off. A value matching
  NO declared arm is still reported, a multi-arm mismatch reports at its strictest
  arm's severity (`error` when an `enum` arm is present, so an enum's closed list
  does not become dismissible by having a second arm added next to it), and arms
  are meant to match the contract rather than relax the gate:
  `element:text_input.defaultValue` deliberately gains no `object` arm because the
  spec rejects a map there, and `element:record_picker.emptyText` keeps its single
  `'string'` arm because that renderer drops the map form (objectui#4163) — an arm
  the renderer never honours would advertise a shape that cannot reach the screen.
- e1d4251: Action param `visible`: one dialect answer, and a fault that is fail-open and LOUD
  
  `ActionParamDialog`'s `filterVisibleParams` was the last predicate face never
  converted to the canonical entry. It evaluated each param's `visible` on a bare
  `ExpressionEvaluator` inside `try { … } catch { return true }`, and that produced
  two defects at once (objectui#4640, measured on `main`):
  
  - **Silence.** Three of the four fault shapes emitted nothing at all — an
    unparseable source, an unbound identifier and a faulting legacy predicate all
    resolved without a word, so a broken `visible` was indistinguishable from an
    absent one. The standing 2026-08-06 ruling on objectui#4051 /
    objectstack#5149 names silence as the one option that is not available.
  - **The fail DIRECTION was decided by the predicate's dialect, not by the
    surface.** A bare string ran the legacy JS evaluator (lenient → falsy → param
    silently DROPPED); a `{ dialect, source }` envelope ran CEL (fault → param
    silently KEPT). One `visible` key, two opposite outcomes, chosen by whether
    the authored text happened to contain `${…}` / `===` — the objectui#3314
    shape. Both halves hurt: a dropped param means the dialog never collects a
    value the server requires and the action fails at submit with nothing pointing
    at the predicate; a kept one offers a field the backend rejects.
  
  `filterVisibleParams` now routes through `evalRowPredicate`. A param whose
  `visible` cannot be evaluated is **shown**, and reported once, with the action
  and the param named and the predicate quoted. Fail-open is the ruled direction
  for this surface: an extra offered field is rejected by the server with a
  message, while a silently hidden required param is undiagnosable. (Row surfaces
  keep failing closed — there the harm runs the other way.) Boolean and blank
  predicates are answered before the evaluator, so `visible: false` hides the
  param and an empty predicate is not reported as broken.
  
  **Behaviour change worth knowing before you upgrade.** On the canonical CEL
  engine an ABSENT key is a runtime fault, not a falsy read. A param gated on
  `features.phoneNumber == true` in a deployment whose scope carries no
  `phoneNumber` key at all now takes the fail-open branch: the param is SHOWN,
  with a warning naming it, where it used to be hidden. The conservative outcome
  is still available, in the spelling that is portable to the server's own engine:
  
  ```
  has(features.phoneNumber) && features.phoneNumber == true
  ```
  
  Deployments that DECLARE the flag (`features: { phoneNumber: false }`) are
  unaffected — that is a genuine verdict on both engines, and it did not move.
  
  `@object-ui/core` gains the two evaluator changes this needed:
  
  - `evalRowPredicate` accepts **`rowless`** — "this surface has no row of its
    own", so nothing is bound over the host scope and a `record` / `data` the
    scope carries survives instead of being shadowed by an empty row. Row surfaces
    are untouched: without the option the row is still the subject (objectui#3796).
  - A faulting **`{ dialect, source }` envelope now reports its own source**.
    It used to print the literal `"(expression)"`, and because the warn-once key
    is (label, predicate), the first faulting envelope under a label silenced
    every other one. The envelope is what `@objectstack/spec` normalizes every
    authored predicate into, so this was the likeliest shape in served metadata
    and the least diagnosable one.
- 167ec42: `ComponentMeta.labelling` grows a third value: `'control' | 'group' | 'display'`
  (objectui#4857, ruled jointly with objectui#4871 as the single repo-wide vocabulary for
  "how does a host learn what a widget will render"). `'display'` declares a widget whose
  whole surface is a pure display in EVERY state — no focusable control, nothing a
  `<label for>` could ever reach.
  
  The form renderer answers the declaration with the objectui#4788 host container (field
  id + `aria-labelledby` + `aria-describedby` + `role="group"`) in the editable state too;
  the `readonly === true` arm keeps its exact #4788 semantics for undeclared widgets. The
  display-only four (`formula` / `summary` / `auto_number` / `vector`) declare `'display'`
  — on the real object-form path they arrive `disabled`, never `readonly` (a deliberate
  distinction this change does not touch), so their visible labels pointed `for` at an id
  no element carried and their help text had zero consumers in every editable form.
  
  `grid` was re-measured before being classified: its only bare-config focusable is the
  auxiliary "Add line" button (routing `for` there would have label clicks insert rows),
  and every realistic config is a table of per-cell inputs — a composite. It declares
  `labelling: 'group'` and its root container now consumes the host id, name and
  description, exactly like `address` / `checkboxes`.
  
  Companion registry gate: `FIELD_WIDGET_LABELLING` (exported) is a `Record` keyed by the
  field-widget map's own literal key union, so registering a widget without deciding its
  labelling is a compile error rather than a silent fall-through to the dangling-`for`
  path, and the declaration test asserts the registered meta agrees with it key by key.
- b1119ec: Project every declared `recordIdField`, and refuse an action that names no record
  
  objectstack#8018. An `api` action declaring `recordIdParam` identifies the record
  it acts on by a row field — `recordIdField`, default `id`. The grid built
  `$select` from the listView columns, `id` and the predicate refs only, so an
  action keyed on any other field asked the server for everything except the key
  naming its own record. The row arrived without it, and the injection was skipped
  silently: the request went out anyway, minus the parameter. A backend reading a
  missing selector as "match nothing" then answers success for having changed
  nothing, so a record-scoped mutation reports success and does nothing.
  
  Two independent repairs, both in this change:
  
  - **Projection.** `listViewPredicates` (`@object-ui/core`) now also harvests
    `recordIdField` from `rowActionDefs`, `bulkActionDefs` and the object's
    `actions`, spelled as a synthetic `record.<name>` so the one existing harvester
    handles it. Both projection builders — `ObjectGrid` and `ListView` — read that
    function, so both gain the key with no call-site change. The existing guards
    still apply: a name the object does not declare, or one that is not a bare
    identifier, is dropped rather than put in `$select`, because an unknown key
    there is not ignored by every backend.
  - **Loud failure.** New `resolveRecordIdParamSeed` (`@object-ui/core`) is the one
    definition of "can this row identify the record?". `useConsoleActionRuntime`'s
    api handler now refuses the dispatch — `{ success: false, error }`, before the
    request — when the row lacks the key, or holds `null` for it. The two refusals
    are worded differently because they point at different repairs: an absent key
    is a projection or read-visibility problem, a null value is a data one. Falsy
    real values (`0`, `''`, `false`) are values and still dispatch.
  
  The second half is what closes the class rather than the common case: a row can
  lack the key for reasons projection cannot fix — a server-side read mask that
  strips the field regardless of `$select`, a partial payload, a field the
  principal cannot read.
  
  Behaviour change worth noting: an action that previously dispatched an
  under-specified request now fails visibly instead. That is the point — the old
  path could not report the failure it was causing.
- af025ee: Draw a null second-dimension group instead of carrying its measure invisibly
  
  objectui#4673. `buildChartSeries`' pivot branch kept the pre-objectui#4466
  answer on the SECOND dimension: it bucketed groups by `String(row[groupKey] ??
  '')` behind a `gId !== ''` gate, so a group whose second dimension is `null`,
  `undefined` or `''` never joined the series list — while the line below the
  gate still wrote its measure into the emitted row under the `''` key. The
  number was in the data and bound to no mark, which is #4466's harm verbatim one
  dimension over: the chart understated its own data without saying so.
  
  Measured on the card's repro — `GROUP BY status, priority` over a Backlog with
  5 hours at High priority and 40 hours at no priority — the transform emitted
  `{status: 'Backlog', High: 5, '': 40}` with a single `High` series, and the
  renderer drew exactly ONE bar. The 40 hours were present in the row, scaled for
  on the y-axis, and painted on nothing.
  
  Two such groups were worse than unbound: `null` and `''` both key `''`, so the
  later group silently overwrote the earlier one's measure and one of the two
  numbers did not survive the transform at all.
  
  **A known-empty group now draws; an unprojected key still refuses.** That split
  is the doctrine the first dimension already used (objectui#4466 versus
  `hasNoCategoryKey`, framework#4033), and it now answers the same way on both
  dimensions. Concretely, a row that does not carry the group key at all gets no
  bucket and contributes no column, where it previously wrote its measure under
  `''`.
  
  `null` and `''` are two different groups with two series, following
  objectui#4508's ruling on the first dimension.
  
  **The series key is collision-safe, not merely unlikely to collide.** Unlike an
  axis bucket's private map key, a series key is a column of the emitted row and
  the `dataKey` a renderer binds to, so it has to be unique within that row. A
  group keys its column by its own display label — leaving an ordinary pivot's
  rows, series, legend, tooltip and drill title exactly as they were — unless
  that label cannot name it: shared with another group (a stored value spelling
  the null bucket's label), reserved by the row itself (the x-axis column, the
  identity carrier), or equal to some group's identity. Those key by identity
  instead, which no other group has. Because no surviving label is any group's
  identity, the two key spaces cannot meet.
  
  Drill-through follows the same assignment: a clicked series key resolves back
  to the group IDENTITY it names, and rows are matched on that. The previous
  `String(r[gDim] ?? '')` comparison was the display-string matching
  objectui#4508 removed on the x-axis — it spelled a null group and an
  empty-string group alike, so the empty-string group's segment resolved to the
  null group's records rather than its own.
  
  No renderer change was needed: the null group's series carries the same
  `nullCategoryLabel` the renderers already pass for the first dimension.
- 9ce096f: Give a chart bucket an identity distinct from its display label
  
  objectui#4508. `buildChartSeries` used the bucket's DISPLAY string as the
  bucket's own key, so two pairs of genuinely different groups were conflated —
  and the segment click that drills a bar back to its records inherited both
  conflations. The maintainer ruling (2026-08-14) approved the sentinel-identity
  direction, aligning the chart branch with the distinct-bucket-id form the pivot
  TABLE (`buildPivot`) already uses over the same dataset rows.
  
  Two collisions, one cause:
  
  - **A null group and an empty-string group drew ONE bar.** The pivot branch
    keyed buckets by `String(xRaw ?? '')`, which spells `null` and `''`
    identically. The bar took its label from whichever row created the bucket, and
    the other group's segment then resolved to no row at all — a visible bar whose
    click did nothing.
  - **A record whose stored value spells the bucket label stole the null bucket's
    drill.** A row storing the literal text `(None)` (or any localized
    `chart.nullCategory` — `(未指定)` and the other nine packs) kept its own
    bucket, so two bars carried the same axis text and BOTH resolved to the first.
    That one is a wrong drill, not a dead one: clicking the null bucket's bar
    opened the drawer on another group's records.
  
  What changed:
  
  - **`chartBucketId`** (`@object-ui/core`) is the bucket identity — the SAME
    encoder `buildPivot` keys its buckets with (`pivotBucketId` over
    `pivotDimensionValue`), so the two surfaces stop answering one question two
    ways. The pivot branch now buckets by it, which is what makes null and `''`
    two groups again.
  - **`CHART_BUCKET_ID_KEY`** carries that identity on an emitted row, written
    exactly where two DISTINCT buckets paint the same axis text — the complete set
    of cases where the display string cannot name what was clicked. An ordinary
    chart's rows are returned untouched (by identity), so no renderer-internal key
    reaches an authoring surface.
  - **`findChartSeriesRow`** takes that identity back as `options.bucketId` and
    treats it as authoritative. The renderers forward it: the drill event gains
    `categoryId` (`ChartSegmentClickEvent`, now declared once in
    `@object-ui/core` instead of inline in three packages), `AdvancedChartImpl`
    reads it off the clicked row on the cartesian, pie and funnel paths, and
    `DatasetWidget.handleChartDrill` hands it to the lookup.
  
  Behaviour change worth noting: an empty-string category no longer resolves to a
  null-valued row. That tolerance was justified as the drill layer's own spelling
  of "no group value", but no producer of this lookup's `category` writes it,
  while `''` IS the axis text a genuine empty-string group paints — so the
  tolerance was giving that group's bar a different group's records. A host that
  forwards no `categoryId` keeps its existing drill unchanged.
- e05db88: A clicked cartesian mark names its own series, and the drill title reads its label
  
  objectui#4672, objectui#4682.
  
  **The dead pivoted drill.** objectui#4680 fixed what a cartesian click could
  read out of recharts 3's `MouseHandlerDataParam`, and measured the wall it could
  not get past: a chart-level click is an AXIS interaction, and recharts
  dispatches those with `activeDataKey` hard-coded `undefined`, because the shared
  cursor spans every series at that tick. A pivoted dataset chart — 2 dimensions,
  1 measure, the shape ADR-0021 introduced — needs the series to resolve its drill
  row, so every segment of every such dashboard chart stayed a dead click. The
  series was left unresolved rather than guessed, and the card carried the rest.
  
  The answer is the mark itself. This renderer draws the `Bar` / `Line` / `Area`,
  so an item-level `onClick` closes over the very `dataKey` it was rendered with —
  the series is statically known, not inferred from tooltip state.
  
  Both handlers fire for one gesture (measured: item first, chart second, sharing
  one `nativeEvent` object), so the item handler does not emit. It RECORDS its
  series, stamped with that gesture, and the chart-level handler composes the one
  event. That is the double-fire answer and the additive property together:
  
  - **one click, one drill event**, because there is one emit site — not a second
    event suppressed after the fact;
  - **a click that lands on no mark is untouched**: it records nothing and falls
    through to the objectui#4680 axis answer exactly as shipped — category, bucket
    identity, and the series only where one series is plotted. Empty plot area
    stays category-only, and "drill the whole category" was rejected as a
    different product question. Nothing that resolved before stops resolving; a
    line's `dot={false}` stroke simply GAINS the exact series where it is hit;
  - pairing on the shared DOM event rather than on a flag means a record left by
    one gesture can never be adopted by a later click.
  
  The clicked key is forwarded exactly as rendered, `''` included: the
  empty-string second-dimension group draws its own bar since objectui#4673, and
  `''` is falsy, so a truthiness test on the way out would send no series at all
  and leave that bar's drill standing on the reader's coercion instead of on what
  was clicked.
  
  **The opaque drill title.** `ChartSegmentClickEvent` gains `seriesLabel`, and
  `DatasetWidget`'s drill drawer titles itself from `seriesLabel ?? series`.
  `ev.series` stays the LOOKUP key — `findChartSeriesRow` resolves it through the
  same assignment `buildChartSeries` made — and only the title reads the label.
  
  The two strings are equal for every ordinary group, which is why reading the key
  as a title went unnoticed. They part company when a group's label cannot name
  it: the null bucket beside a record whose stored value literally spells
  `(None)`, which is objectui#4508's collision on the series axis, reachable since
  objectui#4673. Both groups then key by `chartBucketId`, and the drawer opened on
  the right records under the title `Backlog / [null]`. An internal id where a
  label belongs reads as broken DATA rather than as a broken title.
  
  Neither string can do the other's job, which is why this is a second field
  rather than a change to the first: the label is not resolvable (it is exactly
  what the colliding groups share) and the key is not showable. `seriesLabel` is
  optional and absent wherever a renderer resolved no label, so every other
  chart's title is byte-identical.
- d2ce342: Retire the structured `confirm` object on actions (objectui#4314, maintainer ruling
  2026-08-17, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove). `confirmText` is now the one confirm
  spelling — the only one the translation bundle can address
  (`{ns}.objects.{obj}._actions.{name}.confirmText`), matching `@objectstack/spec`'s
  action surface.
  
  Breaking semantics (flagged `minor` per this repo's version-alignment policy):
  
  - `@object-ui/types`: `ActionSchema.confirm` is a `?: never` tombstone — authoring
    it is now a tsc error, and the Zod twin rejects any authored value at parse time
    (it previously accepted the object). The backwards `@deprecated` note that
    steered authors from `confirmText` INTO the structured arm is gone.
  - `@object-ui/core`: `ActionRunner` no longer reads `confirm.message` (which used
    to outrank `confirmText`, untranslated). `ActionDef.confirm` carries the same
    `never` tombstone. The `ConfirmationHandler` signature is unchanged, but the
    runner now invokes it without the `options` argument.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-grid`: `resolveBulkActions` no longer falls back to
    `confirm.message` when promoting an object action — spec metadata can never
    deliver that key.
  
  Nothing in the repo, the example apps, or the schema catalog authored the
  structured form (verified on the issue); a dialog authored that way silently lost
  localization. Reopen condition recorded on objectui#4314: real demand returns the
  arm WITH bundle keys designed in.

### Patch Changes

- 2533ec5: The bulk-action dialog's "this widget needs a DataSource" rule now derives from the shared reference-field family instead of a fourth private copy.
  
  `packages/plugin-grid/src/components/bulkParamToField.ts` held its own
  `DATA_SOURCE_WIDGET_TYPES` — the fourth hand-maintained answer to one question
  ("which widget has to query records, so it must be handed a DataSource and a
  `reference_to`"), and the only one whose member set matched none of the other
  three: `lookup` / `master_detail` / `user`, against `@object-ui/core`'s
  `EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES` (which also holds `tree`) and the object form's rule
  (which adds three widget-hint pickers). Nothing anywhere could detect the drift;
  the same shape objectui#4770 and objectui#4790 each closed on another surface.
  
  It now reads core's set through one predicate, so all three consumers of the rule
  — the label prefetch / option source (`isLookupishParam`), the `dataSource` prop
  the dialog threads into the widget (`fieldNeedsDataSource`), and the
  `reference_to` / `display_field` branch of `bulkParamToField` — cannot drift apart
  from each other or from the form again.
  
  No behaviour change on any reachable path, which is why this is a patch. The one
  member the two tables differed on, `tree`, can never be a widget key on this
  surface: it is absent from the fields widget map and `mapFieldTypeToFormType`
  sends it to `field:lookup`, so a `tree` param arrives at the rule as `lookup`
  (pinned). The divergence in the other direction is deliberately preserved: the
  form additionally wires `object-ref` / `filter-condition` / `recipient-picker`,
  widget hints no object schema can declare and no bulk param produces — absorbing
  them would change which widgets receive a DataSource here, which is a behaviour
  change and not a convergence.
  
  The pin is an identity pin, not a membership one: it spies on the `has` of the
  Set object core exports, so a member-identical private copy fails it. A
  value-equality assertion would have passed against exactly the defect this
  change removes.
- bbe8b86: The allow-list of option widgets that are fed the live record is now one exported constant, `CASCADE_OPTION_WIDGET_TYPES`, instead of three private copies.
  
  `select` / `multiselect` / `radio` / `checkboxes` are the widgets whose OFFERED
  option set is re-resolved against a record (per-option `visibleWhen`, plus the
  `dependsOn` gate), so they are the widgets a surface must thread its live record
  to. Three surfaces feed that one evaluator — the object form, the single-record
  action dialog and the bulk action dialog — and until now each carried its own
  private `new Set([...])` of the same four keys, with a comment in each asking the
  next person to change all three together. Nothing could have reported them
  drifting: every copy passed its own behavioural tests, and a divergence would
  have shown up only as one surface silently disagreeing with another about what
  "the record" is.
  
  The set now lives in `@object-ui/core`, next to `resolveCascadingOptions` — the
  evaluator that reads that record — because core is the one package all three
  surfaces already depend on, and it is re-exported from `@object-ui/fields` next
  to `resolveFormWidgetType`, whose output is the vocabulary the keys are written
  in. Both are the same object, pinned by test; each consumer keeps its own
  normalization (`normalizeFieldType` in the form, `resolveFormWidgetType` in the
  dialogs), which agree on these four members.
  
  No behaviour changes: the members are identical on all three surfaces, and the
  existing pins for each surface still assert the same records reaching the same
  widgets. The rationale that was repeated in the three copies — including the
  note that the widget-hint picker family (`filter-condition`, `recipient-picker`,
  the lookup family) reads a different sibling key off the same channel and is
  deliberately NOT in this set — is now stated once, in the constant's own
  documentation. Whether the action and bulk dialogs should ever feed those
  pickers stays an open question (objectui#4771), unchanged by this convergence.
- 8477be5: `cloneAsOverride()` now returns `DeepMutable<T>`, so a Tenant/User override draft type-checks as the mutable value it has always been.
  
  `cloneAsOverride<T>(view: T): T` handed the input type straight back. Cloning a
  `SystemView<S>` — which is `DeepReadonly<S>` plus the marker symbol — therefore
  returned something still typed deep-readonly, even though the implementation has
  always produced a plain mutable object (`structuredClone`, or a JSON round-trip
  fallback) and deliberately drops the marker. The declaration was simply wrong
  about its own value, and the documented override flow was the thing that broke:
  
  ```ts
  const draft = cloneAsOverride(userListView)
  draft.columns.push({ name: 'name' })   // TS2339 before this change
  ```
  
  That is `packages/core/README.md`'s override example, and it failed to compile
  against the built types — measured by the doc-snippet compile gate, which reads
  `dist/*.d.ts` rather than source. The neighbouring line one block up,
  `userListView.columns.push(...) // ❌ TypeError (strict mode)`, is the opposite
  demonstration and correctly still fails; only the draft line changes colour.
  
  The fix adds `DeepMutable<T>`, the inverse of the `DeepReadonly<T>` that
  `SystemView` is built from, and returns it. Per the maintainer's 2026-08-19
  ruling (option A on objectui#5257), the alternatives were rejected by name:
  teaching a cast in the README is the lenient-consumer pattern the contract rules
  out, and declaring the block a documentation fragment hides a real signature
  defect behind the fragment marker.
  
  Why this is a patch and not a break: the return type relaxes TOWARD what the
  runtime already does, never away from it. A caller gains permission to mutate;
  nobody loses one. `DeepMutable<S>` stays assignable everywhere `DeepReadonly<S>`
  or `SystemView<S>` was expected, so a caller who fed a draft back into a
  deep-readonly position still compiles — both directions are pinned as type-level
  cases in `freeze-schema.types.test.ts`. A repo-wide sweep found no call site at
  all outside the README, so nothing in this workspace needed changing.
  
  Two limits of `DeepMutable`, stated rather than discovered later. It is
  symmetric with `DeepReadonly` arm for arm, which means it inherits the same
  tuple behaviour: a tuple widens to an array, exactly as `DeepReadonly` widens it
  in the other direction. And it does not remove the `SYSTEM_VIEW_MARKER` key —
  the clone never carries the symbol at runtime, but the key is declared optional,
  so keeping it states "may be absent", which is true. Excluding it would require
  a non-homomorphic mapped type that drops the `?` modifier from every other
  property and turns optional keys required — a strictly worse type traded for
  removing a key that already reads as optional.
- ad07b65: Four packages stop publishing tooling material in their `dist/`
  
  Each of these packages spelled its build exclusions as `*.test.*`, while this repo's tooling convention is a directory one — `__tests__` / `__mocks__` / `__benchmarks__`, exactly as `TOOLING_FILE` in `scripts/check-phantom-dependencies.mjs` spells it. Any tooling file whose *name* is not `*.test.*` therefore stayed in the emit program and shipped in the tarball. This is the same shape and the same cause as objectui#4006, which fixed `@object-ui/fields` and `@object-ui/plugin-editor` by the filename criterion and so did not reach these four.
  
  Measured by building each package from a cleared `dist/` on both sides of the change. Nine files disappear, none appears, and every surviving file is untouched — the totals move by exactly the count removed:
  
  | package | `dist/` files | removed |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `@object-ui/core` | 176 to 174 | `dist/__benchmarks__/core.bench.js`, `core.bench.d.ts` |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-designer` | 70 to 66 | `dist/__tests__/__mocks__/plugin-form.d.ts`, `plugin-grid.d.ts`, and both `.d.ts.map` |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-grid` | 62 to 60 | `dist/__tests__/explainDouble.d.ts` and its `.d.ts.map` |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-view` | 13 to 12 | `dist/__tests__/explainDouble.d.ts` |
  
  Only `@object-ui/core`'s had runtime weight. The other eight are declarations nothing resolves, but `core.bench.js` is a real emitted module whose first import is `import { bench, describe } from 'vitest'` — a runtime import of a package a consumer never installs, since `vitest` is a devDependency of `@object-ui/core` and devDependencies are not installed transitively. Nothing resolves it today either (it is not in the `exports` map), so no consumer breaks in either direction; this is the tarball shedding files nothing reached.
  
  No type coverage leaves with the emit. The three plugins' helper and mock files are already program inputs of the `tsconfig.test.json` that each package's `type-check` chains, reached through the imports in the suites beside them — `tsc --listFiles` names all four files on both sides of the change. `core.bench.ts` had no such edge, since nothing imports a benchmark, so it is now named explicitly in `packages/core/tsconfig.test.json`. That move was deliberate rather than forced: `scripts/check-type-check-coverage.mjs` enumerates `*.test.ts(x)` only, so a benchmark that no program reads is invisible to it, and dropping the coverage silently would have been the "coverage that was right by accident" objectui#4006 recorded. Verified by appending a provably-false annotation to the benchmark, which turns `tsc -p packages/core/tsconfig.test.json` red at exit 2.
- 41f498b: Fix `packages/core/README.md`'s Component Registry example, which taught
  `new ComponentRegistry()` against an exported singleton **instance**, not a
  class — the built `packages/core/dist/registry/Registry.d.ts` declares
  `export declare const ComponentRegistry: Registry<any>`, so the snippet did
  not compile (`TS2351: This expression is not constructable`, measured by the
  objectui#5138 doc-snippet type gate). A reader who copied it got a compile
  error; if `new ComponentRegistry()` had compiled it would have produced a
  second, empty registry nothing renders from, the more expensive half of the
  mistake.
  
  The snippet now calls `ComponentRegistry.register(...)` /
  `ComponentRegistry.get(...)` directly on the singleton, with one line stating
  it is the process-level shared instance `SchemaRenderer` resolves every
  `type` against — the same wording `packages/components/README.md` was given
  in objectui#5160, kept consistent across both READMEs. Readers who want their
  own isolated registry still have `Registry` itself, separately exported as a
  real class.
  
  `scripts/check-doc-snippet-types.mjs`'s `UNGATED_DOCS` entry for
  `packages/core/README.md` is updated to match: `TS2351x1` is dropped from its
  reason text now that the diagnostic is gone. The entry is not deleted — the
  document's remaining `TS2339x2` pair (a different, pre-existing defect) is
  out of scope for this change; it's tracked as objectui#5257.
- ac600e5: A `user` field in a form now receives `dataSource` / `dependentValues` / `dependsOnLabels`, like every other reference field.
  
  The form renderer decided which registered widget gets those three props from a
  module-private `DATA_SOURCE_FIELD_TYPES` set, while `@object-ui/core` kept
  `EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES` for the same underlying fact — a field whose stored
  value is a foreign key into another object. The core side's TSDoc claimed to
  mirror the form's set, and it did for 15 days: the form's copy then gained
  `capability-multiselect` (objectui#2403) and the three widget-hint pickers
  `object-ref` / `filter-condition` / `recipient-picker` (objectui#2421) on the
  same day, after which the two sets were not in a subset relation in either
  direction — `user` only in core, the picker names only in the form — with
  nothing able to report it.
  
  The form now derives its rule instead of restating it: the reference half is
  core's set, the form-specific half is the three picker names, which are widget
  hints and can never be a declarable field `type`. Adding a member to
  `EXPANDABLE_FIELD_TYPES` therefore also grants it the form's data-source wiring;
  that coupling is intended and is now written down on both sides.
  
  The user-visible half is `user`. It previously received none of the three props.
  `dataSource` and `dependentValues` each have a `SchemaRendererContext` fallback
  inside the widget, so the person picker limped along wherever a provider
  happened to supply one; `dependsOnLabels` has no fallback, so a
  dependency-gated user picker interpolated the raw API name into its
  "select ... first" hint in every locale — the leak objectstack#5407 closed for
  lookups and left open here. The widget contract's own `dataSource` doc has
  always named `user` among the types the form renderer injects for.
  
  No change to what is expanded, projected or rendered anywhere else: the core
  set's members are untouched.
- c1ef923: Grid and related-list column headers no longer offer a sort on a `formula` column.
  
  A `formula` value is computed on read: no driver materialises a column for it, so
  a server `$orderby` naming one has nothing to order by. That sort never worked.
  Until objectstack#6994 the platform did not say so — the response carried the very
  values it had been asked to order by, out of order, under a `200`, with ascending
  and descending byte-identical on a real SQL driver — and it now answers
  `400 INVALID_SORT`. So the header was wrong before the platform's refusal and is
  wrong after it, for the same reason: it offers a sort that cannot be performed.
  
  `ObjectGrid` withheld the affordance only from reference-bearing columns
  (objectui#3096). Unmaterialized types are a SECOND reason a server sort is
  impossible, not a different mechanism, so it now reads both — and so do the two
  sort entry points of a related list (the embedded table's headers and the
  sort-button row a `data-list` card keeps), which each derived that rule
  separately.
  
  Client-side sorting is deliberately unchanged. There the rows are all in the
  browser and the formula value is the one the server hydrated on read, so ordering
  by what the cell shows is honest — the same split the relational carve-out makes.
  A sort DECLARED in view metadata is also unchanged: it still goes out and is still
  refused by name, because silently dropping an author's declaration would hide the
  authoring error instead of surfacing it (the toolbar's sort picker keeps such a
  field listed for exactly that reason — it is the only way to remove it).
  
  The membership — `formula` alone — moved out of a private set in `ListView` into
  `@object-ui/core` (`UNMATERIALIZED_FIELD_TYPES` / `isUnmaterializedFieldType`),
  bound to `@objectstack/spec`'s own storage predicate so the renderer cannot drift
  from what the drivers actually store. It is deliberately narrower than the spec's
  write contract `COMPUTED_VALUE_TYPES`: a `summary` and an `autonumber` each get a
  real maintained column and sort correctly, and withholding their headers would
  have broken two affordances that work.
- af5e292: Emit explicit file extensions on relative import specifiers, so the published
  entries can be imported by Node's own ESM resolver.
  
  `@object-ui/react`'s built entry re-exported through extensionless relative
  specifiers (`export * from './SchemaRenderer'`). Node does not extension-search
  relative specifiers, so `import('@object-ui/react')` under plain Node — an SSR
  host, or any consumer without a bundler — failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
  Bundled consumers were never affected and are unchanged by this.
  
  `@object-ui/types`, `@object-ui/core` and `@object-ui/i18n` carried the same
  emission; `@object-ui/react`'s entry stayed unloadable until they were fixed
  too, because evaluation crosses into them. No exported API changed.
- 9f23d2b: The object list's Import button now honours `userActions.import`'s CEL predicates.
  
  `@objectstack/spec@17.0.0` widened BOTH toolbar-scope keys, not just `create`:
  `userActions.create` and `userActions.import` are typed identically
  (`z.union([z.boolean(), RowCrudActionOverrideSchema])`) and
  `resolveCrudAffordances` emits a predicate envelope for each, with the docblock
  binding them in one breath ("`importPredicates` — same binding as
  `createPredicates`"). objectui#4646 gave the `create` half a consumer and left
  the `import` half declared-and-inert: `importPredicates` had zero readers in
  objectui. An author could write `userActions.import.visibleWhen`, have the spec
  accept it and the resolver parse it, and watch the object-list toolbar offer the
  CSV import wizard unconditionally.
  
  The toolbar now evaluates them, mirroring the related list's create half:
  `visibleWhen` fails CLOSED (an unevaluable predicate hides the entry and warns
  once), `disabledWhen` fails SOFT (an unevaluable one leaves the button enabled),
  and the declared-ness rules are the family's — `?? true` for `visibleWhen` so
  `visibleWhen: false` hides rather than reading as "ungated", `!= null` for
  `disabledWhen` so an empty predicate reads as "no condition". The layer sits on
  TOP of the object-level verdict: a predicate can narrow what the `managedBy`
  bucket, the server's effective API operations and the principal's grant already
  allow, never re-open what they closed.
  
  Per the spec's binding, a toolbar predicate evaluates once per toolbar against
  the record of the scope the toolbar sits in — and a standalone object list has
  no record in scope. Predicates over the host scope (`os.user.*`, `features.*`)
  are the meaningful shape there; one reading `record.*` has nothing to bind and
  hides the entry, which is the fail-closed rule the spec spells out for exactly
  this surface.
  
  `UserActionsOverride.import` widens from `boolean` to the same union as
  `create`, deliberately in this same change: objectui#4646 kept it narrow on
  purpose because widening a type ahead of its consumer re-declares the
  inert-metadata defect one key over. Type and consumer travel together.
- 31676be: `buildChartSeries`' pivot branch preserves key ABSENCE, so a never-projected first dimension still reaches the framework#4033 placeholder.
  
  `hasNoCategoryKey` (plugin-charts' `AdvancedChartImpl`) exists to catch one
  shape: a dimension a dataset query GROUPED BY but never PROJECTED, so no row
  carries the category key. Rather than draw an axis with no marks, the renderer
  names the missing key. Its whole signal is `key in row`, asked of the rows it is
  handed — which for a dataset-bound chart are `buildChartSeries`' output.
  
  The pivot branch wrote `[xKey]` onto every bucket it created, so `key in row`
  was unconditionally true downstream and the guard could not fire for a
  2-dimension/1-measure chart no matter what the query returned. Every row
  collapsed into one unnamed bucket drawing a blank tick — the exact silent shape
  the placeholder was introduced to eliminate. The defence was dead precisely
  where the defect it guards against lands. The single-dimension branch was never
  affected: it passes rows through, so key-absent rows stay key-absent.
  
  An emitted bucket now carries the axis key exactly when some row of it did.
  That is `hasNoCategoryKey`'s own `rows.some(key in row)` lifted through the
  pivot's aggregation, so the guard reads the same fact before and after.
  
  The route rests on a measurement of how a dataset query actually reports an
  unprojected dimension in a 2-dimension grouping: it OMITS the key. The ObjectQL
  strategy writes a dimension key only when the engine returned that column, the
  native-SQL strategy returns driver rows carrying only the selected columns, JSON
  cannot transport `undefined`, and `ObjectStackAdapter.queryDataset` passes rows
  through by reference. An explicit `null` means the opposite — the column WAS
  projected and its value is null — and that case is untouched: it still renders
  under the `(None)` bucket label (objectui#4466 / objectui#4497). Where one
  bucket collects both (an absent value and a stored `null` share the `[null]`
  identity), the bucket keeps its label and draws, because refusing there would
  tell an author their query never projected a dimension that it did.
  
  No change to any chart whose first dimension projected: ordinary, null-valued
  and empty-string categories all emit byte-identical rows, key order included.
- 5ffcc14: fix(plugin-report): forward the chart chrome and series presentation `ReportChartSchema` declares (objectui#4877)
  
  A report's embedded chart forwarded exactly six keys to the registered chart
  component — `chartType`, `data`, `height`, `isAnimationActive`, `series`,
  `xAxisKey`. Everything else `ReportChartSchema` declares as authorable never
  left the report renderer, so it was inert metadata: the author writes it, the
  schema accepts it, nothing reads it.
  
  `showLegend` was the sharpest case because dropping it does not merely ignore
  the author, it INVERTS them: `AdvancedChartImpl` computes
  `legendVisible = showLegend !== false`, so an absent value means the legend is
  on and an explicit `showLegend: false` still drew one.
  
  Now lowered, under objectui#4229's ruled data/presentation split:
  
  - chrome — `showLegend`, `showDataLabels`, `colors` (both the positional-palette
    array and the per-category record), `subtitle`, `description`, `annotations`,
    `interaction`, `height`;
  - per-series presentation — `color`, `stack`, `type`, `yAxis`, `dashArray`,
    `opacity`, `variant`, matched by `series[].name` so series MEMBERSHIP stays
    with the dataset.
  
  `title` is deliberately not forwarded: the report renderer paints it as its own
  heading above the plot, and forwarding it would draw a second one inside the
  chart's frame. `aria` is not lowered either — nothing on this path reads it
  (`AdvancedChartImpl` has no `aria` prop, and this renderer hands the component a
  schema directly rather than through `SchemaRenderer`'s flat ARIA injection), so
  forwarding it would move declared-but-unread one layer down.
  
  The two helpers (`chartConfigPresentation`, `mergeAuthoredPresentation`) moved
  from `plugin-dashboard`'s `DatasetWidget` to `@object-ui/core` beside
  `buildChartSeries`, the derivation they merge onto, so both surfaces lower one
  vocabulary once instead of keeping a second copy (the duplication objectui#4389
  filed as a defect). `@object-ui/core` additionally exports `mergeAuthoredSeries`
  — the series merge alone — for a surface whose axes are bare dimension/measure
  NAME strings rather than spec `ChartAxis` objects, which is what a report chart
  declares. `DatasetWidget` re-exports both names, so its public surface and its
  rendering are unchanged.
- d971e51: A create form no longer deadlocks on a `requiredWhen` field that also declares a runtime `defaultValue`.
  
  `#4069` ruled that in **create** mode a field whose `defaultValue` is a runtime
  instruction the server resolves per insert (`NOW()` / `current_user`, or a CEL
  Expression envelope) is producer-owned: the control is deliberately left empty
  and the key is omitted from the payload, because `ObjectQL.applyFieldDefaults`
  resolves the declaration only for a field that arrives absent or null. That was
  implemented on the STATIC `required` flag.
  
  The conditional spelling was not covered. `requiredWhen` is resolved one layer
  downstream, in the form renderer, against the live record — so a predicate
  resolving TRUE on a create form put the requirement straight back: the control
  was still empty by design, the submit was refused, and the user had nothing
  sensible to type.
  
  Both spellings now behave identically on a producer-owned field. A
  `requiredWhen` predicate is a claim about the value at rest in a given state,
  and `NOW()` / `current_user` resolve at insert regardless of state, so the
  producer's guarantee covers the conditional claim by the same argument that
  covers the unconditional one. An author who really means "the user must supply
  this in this state" has a natural spelling for it: do not declare the default.
  
  The suppression lands in the single evaluator both layers read,
  `resolveFieldRuleState` — the same verdict that draws the required marker and
  the one the submit-time check consults — so a field can never lose its asterisk
  while still refusing the write. The classifier that answers "is this value the
  producer's to supply" moved down to `@object-ui/core`
  (`isRuntimeDefault` / `isServerOwnedValue`, re-exported from
  `@object-ui/plugin-form`) so the renderer, the wizard's cross-step gate and the
  create-form field builders all read one implementation rather than three.
  
  **Edit mode is unchanged.** Defaults do not re-apply to an existing record, so
  on a persisted row the token was already resolved at insert and blanking the
  column is a real removal: `requiredWhen` enforces there exactly as authored.
  Fields with no declared default, and fields whose default is a static literal
  (which IS seeded into the control), are also unaffected in both modes.
- dfc6975: Related-list "+ New" now honours `userActions.create` predicates, and the grid
  toolbar's inline-edit affordance is gated on `update` permission (objectui#4646,
  objectui#4647).
  
  Two declared-but-unenforced gaps on the same toolbar surface.
  
  **#4646 — `createPredicates` had a producer and no consumer.**
  `@objectstack/spec@17.0.0` widened `userActions.create` to
  `z.union([z.boolean(), RowCrudActionOverrideSchema])`, so `resolveCrudAffordances`
  emits `createPredicates` — and nothing in objectui read them, against roughly
  fifteen consumption sites apiece for `editPredicates` / `deletePredicates`. The
  symptom: a parent record entering a frozen state correctly greyed its children's
  row Edit/Delete while the related list's "+ New" stayed fully live, so the user
  filled in the whole child form to earn a server 409. The related-list toolbar now
  evaluates `visibleWhen` / `disabledWhen` **once against the host parent record**,
  per the spec docblock's binding for this key, on top of the existing
  `o.create ∧ can(child, 'create')` check. `visibleWhen` hides "+ New" and fails
  CLOSED; `disabledWhen` greys it and fails SOFT — the same evaluator, fail
  directions and hidden-vs-disabled split the record header already uses for
  edit/delete (objectui#4419 / PR #4515). A bare-boolean `userActions.create` is
  untouched: with no predicates there is nothing to evaluate.
  
  **#4647 — the inline-edit toggle was the one ungated affordance on its toolbar.**
  It rendered on "grid view ∧ the host wired `onInlineEditChange` ∧ not the compact
  toolbar", and every host wires that callback unconditionally. New and Import are
  hidden for an account without the grant and the bulk-delete entry on the same
  toolbar ANDs `can(obj, 'delete')`, but a read-only principal could flip inline
  edit, modify cells and press "Save all" to earn a server 403. It is now gated on
  the object's resolved edit affordance ∧ `can(object, 'update')`, mirroring that
  bulk-delete gate. The gate is applied at all three sites that carry this
  affordance — the wide toolbar's toggle, the compact toolbar's settings-popover
  entry (which previously had no gate at all, not even the callback), and the
  `editable` mode handed to the grid, so a stored view carrying `inlineEdit: true`
  can no longer drop a read-only principal into editable cells with no toggle to
  press.
  
  `ListViewSchema.userActions.editInline` is also consumed now: an explicit `false`
  withholds the affordance wholesale, which authors previously could not do.
  
  **Behaviour change for read-only users, stated plainly.** Where the UI used to
  offer inline editing and let the server refuse it, it now declines to offer the
  entry point at all. No data access changes — the server gate was and remains the
  enforcement boundary; this only stops the UI walking users into round-trips
  guaranteed to fail. Accounts *with* the grant see no change, and hosts with no
  `PermissionProvider` mounted (standalone embeds, the Studio designer) keep
  today's behaviour, since `can()` answers `true` there by design.
  
  One deliberate non-change: the absent case of `userActions.editInline` defers to
  the host's existing `inlineEdit` channel rather than enforcing the spec's
  `.default(false)`. Enforcing that default would remove the toggle from every
  stored console list view in one release, since nothing folds a legacy key into
  `editInline` and no existing view declares it. This follows the rule the
  surrounding toolbar-flag block already states for itself — defaults chosen to
  match what the flags have always done. `InterfaceListPage`, the key's other
  consumer, reads the absent case as OFF, because the ADR-0047 interface page has
  no such host channel to defer to.

## 17.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ee66e2e: Close `ActionDef` — delete the `[key: string]: any` index signature and converge `visible` / `disabled` on the spec's unified shape.

  `ActionDef` accepted any key of any type, so a typo (`targt`) and a retired spec
  key (`execute`) both type-checked and the runner then silently bound no handler
  — the objectstack#2169 "Mark Done does nothing" shape. Step 1
  (objectstack#4075) made that audible with a dev-mode warning; step 2 promoted
  the 18 spec-owned keys to real fields. This is **step 3**, executing the
  maintainer's 2026-08-06 ruling now that its upstream half shipped in
  `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0-rc.6 (objectstack#5970).

  - **`visible` and `disabled` now have ONE shape, derived from the spec** —
    `boolean | string(CEL) | { dialect, source }`. The ruling was "统一形状,spec
    采纳": boolean is the degenerate literal verdict, the string is CEL shorthand,
    the envelope is the full form. `visible` loses its hand-written `| boolean`
    (the spec adopted that arm, so restating it locally would be a second
    contract), and `disabled` gains the envelope arm it never had — it was
    `string | boolean`, which is why the envelope the spec emits could only be
    read through a cast.
  - **The index signature is gone.** `tsc` now rejects an unknown or retired key
    at any site that authors an action literal in code.
  - **Five keys the deletion surfaced, promoted to real fields.** `to`,
    `external`, `newTab`, `replace` — the `navigation` alias's own spelling, ruled
    legitimate by step 1 and listed in `NAVIGATION_ALIAS_KEYS` ever since, but
    declared only as data; and `description`, which every action renderer forwards
    (`check:action-forward-parity` requires it) and the param-collection dialog
    reads for its subtitle (objectui#4192). These were the only two `TS2353`s the
    deletion produced across the whole workspace.
  - **`ActionContext` keeps its index signature**, deliberately. It is a runtime
    data bag whose keys are genuinely open; `ActionDef` is a declared metadata
    contract. That asymmetry is the point, and it is now pinned in both
    directions.

  **Breaking edge, deliberate — same class as step 2's, one step further.** An
  `ActionDef` literal carrying a key this interface does not declare is now a
  compile error where it previously compiled and did nothing at runtime. That
  includes the retired `execute` (rename it to `target`; `os migrate meta --from
16` rewrites it) and plain typos. Values that were only ever absorbed silently
  are the ones that stop compiling, so the failure moves to where it can be fixed
  rather than appearing as a button that does nothing.

  **What did NOT retire with the index signature**, contrary to step 1's
  expectation: the dev-mode `warnOnUnknownActionKeys` shim and `executeScript`'s
  `execute` rename prescription both stay. `tsc` only ever sees actions authored
  as TypeScript, while stored `sys_metadata` rows are rehydrated UNPARSED
  (objectstack#3903) — which is the population `execute: 'markDone'` actually
  lives in. The two mechanisms cover disjoint populations; retiring the runtime
  half would have re-opened the gap it was written for.

- 3fc2971: A null-keyed group renders as an explicit bucket instead of silently vanishing from a chart (objectui#4466)

  `buildChartSeries`' single-dimension branch passed rows through verbatim, so a row whose category VALUE is `null` reached recharts with a null category and drew no mark. The visible outcome was not an empty chart but a quietly wrong one: rows `[{user_id: null, event_count: 51}, {user_id: 'Dev Admin', event_count: 2}]` drew exactly ONE bar — the dominant group, 51 of 53 events, dropped while the y-axis scale still accommodated it, so the chart understated its own data and the axis proved the data had been there. With every group null it drew axes, gridlines and an axis title with zero marks and no empty state, which is the shipped first-boot state of the built-in System Overview board's "Events by User" (every seeded `sys_audit_log` row is written with `user_id = NULL`).

  The mapping lives in the shared series layer, so dashboard widgets and standalone `ObjectChart` get one answer rather than a per-chart patch in the recharts wrapper. It resolves the two-answers disagreement the card names as well: an empty result set keeps the designed empty state, a non-empty result always draws bars — the null bucket included.

  `@object-ui/core` gains `NULL_CATEGORY_LABEL` and `ChartSeriesOptions`; `buildChartSeries` and `findChartSeriesRow` each take an optional trailing `options`. Both additive — every existing call site compiles and behaves identically, and a result with no null category is still returned by array identity. The two helpers are a pair on purpose: the caller matches a clicked segment against rows that still carry the raw `null`, so `findChartSeriesRow` reads the bucket label back to that row and the newly-visible bar keeps its drill-through instead of resolving to `-1`.

  The label goes through the i18n channel (`chart.nullCategory`, en `(None)` / zh `(未指定)`, all ten packs), passed down by the renderer: `@object-ui/core` is React-free and cannot read the locale bundle, so it takes the resolved string the same way `dimensionOptionTranslator` takes a resolver. Its English constant is the floor for a provider-less host, not the mechanism.

  `hasNoCategoryKey` (framework#4033) is untouched and now documented against this: a row that does not carry the category key AT ALL is a different defect — a dimension grouped by but never projected — and keeps its explanatory placeholder. The bucket deliberately never ADDS the key to such a row, which is what keeps that guard's signal alive. Key absent → the placeholder; key present with a null value → the bucket.

- dde7283: `chatbot` and `chatbot-enhanced` now pass only whitelisted DOM props to their host element (objectui#4431)

  Both registrations destructured `schema` and `className` and forwarded everything else. `SchemaRenderer` hands a registered component the authored node's own keys, the contents of its `props` container, the ARIA it resolved and the host's trailing props — so all of it became attributes on the chat root `div`, because React passes unknown lowercase attributes through in silence and stringifies object values. Measured through the real SDUI path with a data-source adapter attached: **14 non-DOM attributes on each widget**, including `datasource="[object Object]"` (the injected adapter, which only appears on a deployment that really loads data) and a camelCase `arialabel` sitting next to the resolved `aria-label`, so the element carried each ARIA value twice under two spellings — one of them meaningless to assistive technology.

  Both are now consume-or-whitelist: configuration is read off `schema` as before, the evaluated `disabled` verdict is consumed by name, and only `toDomProps`' output reaches the element. The resolved `aria-label` / `aria-describedby`, `role`, `id`, `tabIndex` and the `data-*` family still arrive — dropping them would have been an accessibility regression dressed as a leak fix, so the pin asserts the delivered set exactly, not just the absent one. `chatbot-floating` is untouched: its content mounts through a portal and its root never spread.

  `@object-ui/core` gains the shared executor this migration needs (`utils/dom-props.ts`): `toDomProps` for the SDUI widget contract, plus `pickDomProps` — the mechanism — for a package whose own contract declares a different key set. That is the objectui#4409 dependency direction: plugin packages declare `@object-ui/core` and must not grow a dependency on `@object-ui/fields` to reach a whitelist.

  `@object-ui/fields` keeps its own key list and its compile-time bindings, and now executes them through core's mechanism. Its behaviour is unchanged and its exported `DomProps<P>` is the same structural type. The two lists differ for measured reasons and no longer can drift silently: `name` and `disabled` are legal only on form controls, which is what every field widget renders and what `FieldWidgetComponentProps` declares, while `role` is resolved by `SchemaRenderer` for every SDUI node and is not part of the field contract. A new assertion binds every shared key in both directions, with `role` named as the single deliberate exception.

- f279deb: fix(core): bare-string filter options — docs/examples stop teaching it, the runtime lift warns (objectui#4356)

  `globalFilters[].options` had two de-facto contracts. `@objectstack/spec`'s `GlobalFilterSchema` accepts only `{ value, label }` pairs, while `normalizeFilterOptions` also lifted a bare-string shorthand (`options: ['EMEA', 'APAC']`) — so a dashboard authored that way rendered correctly in objectui and was refused the moment it reached the platform's validation. That is the "one strict contract beats N dialects" divergence AGENTS.md #0.1 names, with the renderer's tolerance hiding the producer's bug instead of surfacing it.

  Maintainer ruling of 2026-08-12 on objectstack#7917, verbatim 「7917 ②」: **the spec stays strict; the runtime lift retires behind a deprecation window sized by a stored-dashboard survey.** This is Phases 0 and 1 of that window, shipped together. Phase 2 (removing the lift) is scheduled on objectstack#7917 and is deliberately not here.

  **Phase 1 — the lift now says so out loud.** `normalizeFilterOptions` still lifts a bare string, unchanged and mechanically lossless (`'EMEA'` becomes `{ value: 'EMEA', label: 'EMEA' }`), because stored dashboards carry the shorthand and dropping it silently would turn a rendering filter into an empty one. It now also logs a deprecation warning naming the offending filter, quoting the offending values, and printing the canonical replacement. The warning fires **once per offending filter per session** — `resolveDashboardFilterDefs` runs on every dashboard render, and a warning that floods the console is a warning that gets muted — and it is dev-mode only, matching the `warnOnDeprecatedObjectParams` convention in `actions/actionKeys.ts`. It does not fire for canonical object options, and a mixed array names only its bare members, since partial migrations happen. A silent lift can never be retired, because nothing would ever show that the last shorthand document is gone (ADR-0078).

  **Phase 0 — objectui stopped teaching the form.** The stored-dashboard survey on objectstack#7917 found the shorthand's source: objectui's own docs and its schema-catalog corpus — which the catalog's `package.json` declares an AI RAG/few-shot retrieval source — still authored it, so the stored population was still growing. All seven non-test occurrences are corrected to the pair form: `content/docs/guide/dashboard-filters.md` (a code block **and** a prose passage that presented the shorthand as an equal alternative), `content/docs/plugins/plugin-dashboard.mdx`, `packages/plugin-dashboard/README.md`, and the three `examples/schema-catalog` `filtered-dashboard*.json` entries. Warning authors while the docs still taught the form would have been a contradiction users report as a bug.

  **Guardrail.** The schema catalog previously asserted only that its entries were structurally well-formed and rendered without throwing — which is exactly how a spec-invalid example got in. Every `globalFilters[]` entry in every `plugin-dashboard` catalog example is now parsed with the real `@objectstack/spec` `GlobalFilterSchema`, with a non-vacuity control so a broken sweep cannot read as green.

  New export: `resetDashboardFilterWarnings()`, the warn-once memo reset, matching `resetActionKeyWarnings`. Graded `minor` for that additive export — measured, the emitted `.d.ts` gains exactly one declaration and narrows nothing.

- eb7f586: Dashboard dataset measures follow the display locale (objectui#4566).

  `formatMeasure` and `formatDimensionValue` in `@object-ui/core` formatted every
  value with a bare `undefined` locale tag at all three of their `Intl` sites.
  `undefined` is not "the user's locale", it is the MACHINE's — neither of the
  repo's two locale channels. A German session read a dashboard KPI as `1,234.5`
  next to a grid cell rendering the same number as `1.234,5`, and inverted
  separators read as a different number, not as an unstyled one.

  Both functions take the display locale as a new OPTIONAL LAST parameter, and
  `DatasetWidget` threads `useDisplayLocale()` into every site it formats through:
  the KPI, the grouped table's measure and dimension cells, and the cross-tab's
  header labels and cells.

  **English output does not move**, and that is the discriminator against the
  sibling fix. These sites already went through `Intl` with default grouping, so
  the only thing that changes is WHOSE locale is used:

  |                   | before      | after                 |
  | ----------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
  | en, 1234.5 `0.0`  | `1,234.5`   | `1,234.5` (unchanged) |
  | de, 1234.5 `0.0`  | `1,234.5`   | `1.234,5`             |
  | de, 1234.5 EUR    | `€1,234.50` | `1.234,50 €`          |
  | de, 0.6083 `0.0%` | `60.8%`     | `60,8%`               |

  Contrast objectui#4553, where `formatPercent` had never grouped at all and
  moving en `1235%` → `1,235%` WAS the fix.

  Omitting the new argument reproduces the previous output byte for byte, so
  callers that do not thread a locale yet are unaffected.

  Two behaviours are deliberately preserved rather than "improved" alongside the
  locale fix, both measured:

  - **Integers stay verbatim.** The integer branch renders no separator and no
    decimal mark, so a locale has nothing to change there — and routing it through
    `Intl` WOULD change it (a locale with its own numbering system re-digits it,
    and `1e21` expands to 22 digits).
  - **The percent sign stays a literal suffix.** `Intl`'s `style: 'percent'`
    re-scales by 100, and that round trip loses precision at the top of the range
    (en `100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000%` becomes
    `99,999,999,999,999,990,000,000%`). The consequence — a German list cell
    writing `1.234,5 %` with a no-break space where a dashboard measure writes
    `1.234,5%` — is filed separately rather than smuggled in behind a locale fix.

  `@object-ui/core` is `minor` because two of its ENTRY exports gained an optional
  parameter (measured in the built `.d.ts`). `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` is
  `patch`: its published declarations are unchanged — `buildPivot`'s new optional
  parameter is internal, as that function is not on the package's `exports`
  surface.

- e901131: `DatasetResultField` is now `@objectstack/spec`'s `AnalyticsResult.fields[]` element itself, not a hand-written restatement of it

  `packages/core/src/utils/dataset-format.ts` declared its own six-key interface for the analytics result column, under a doc comment describing the server's contract. The key set happened to match the spec today, so nothing was broken — but it was the last surviving member of the derive-don't-restate family (#3613 / #3753 on the parameter side, #3752 on the adapter return side), and it was the member with no compile-time tripwire: three surfaces (`plugin-dashboard`'s `DatasetWidget`, `plugin-report`'s `DatasetReportRenderer`, app-shell's `DatasetPreview`) consume this name AS the real column type, so the next spec column key would simply never appear here and no build would complain. It is now `AnalyticsResult['fields'][number]`, so it cannot lag the contract again.

  **Consumer-visible type tightening (the reason this is a minor, not a patch).** The restatement had relaxed `type` to optional; the contract requires it. Anything that assigned a column literal without `type` — or a bare `{ name, label?, format? }` — to `DatasetResultField` will now fail to compile, and the fix is to supply the `type` the server always sends. Nothing in this repo needed changing: every value of this type originates in `ObjectStackAdapter.queryDataset`, which already declares the spec element, and no consumer reads `.type` at all, so the widening had bought no caller anything while advertising a `string | undefined` the wire never produces. Marked `minor` per the repo's bump policy, which reserves `major` for following `@objectstack/spec` across a major.

  The exported name is unchanged and the `PercentScale` re-export from this module is untouched, so existing import paths keep working. `packages/core/tsconfig.typetests.json` (chained off the package's `type-check`) compiles the new parity test, so the pins are checked by CI rather than merely written down — including a negative pin that goes red if the hand-written interface is ever restored, and the `ChartResultField` superset relationship the module's comment claims.

- d9d3463: Retire four zero-consumer declared surfaces (dead-surface sweep batch 3, #4328). Each was
  measured as declared-but-never-read at the branch point, and each is removed rather than
  left as an authoring surface whose values nothing acts on.

  Breaking for anyone who typed against the removed declarations, marked `minor` per this
  repository's version-alignment convention (the major tracks `@objectstack`, never an
  API-break count):

  - `@object-ui/core` no longer exports `mergeViewsIntoObjects`. It was a second copy left
    behind by the move of that step to the provider layer, and it had drifted: it ignored a
    view container's default `list` and keyed views by the authored bare key instead of the
    composer's `<object>.<key>` identity. The live implementation — `MetadataProvider`'s, in
    `@object-ui/app-shell` — is unchanged and remains the only one. (#3775)
  - `@object-ui/types`' `RoleDefinition` no longer declares `permissions`. A role's grants
    live in `ObjectPermissionConfig.roles`, keyed by object; that is the only home any
    consumer reads (`resolveRoles` walks `inherits` and matches on `name`). The removed
    field was _required_, so five fixtures across three packages had been declaring an empty
    array for a value nothing would ever look at. Role-attached grants are now a compile
    error rather than silently ignored data. (#4288)
  - `@object-ui/react`'s `RecordContextValue` no longer declares `loading` / `error`. Both
    had zero producers and zero consumers — no host passed them, no `record:*` renderer read
    them — and only the provider's memo dependency list still named them. Record-level
    loading and error state stays where it is actually expressed: each renderer's own data
    source. (#3773)

  No behaviour change, no request-count change:

  - `@object-ui/data-objectstack` drops five `metadataCache.invalidate('views:<object>')`
    calls across `updateViewConfig` / `createView` / `updateView` / `deleteView`. No read
    path has ever populated that key — `listViews` fetches directly, uncached — so all five
    were permanent no-ops. The invalidations of the keys that do have readers
    (`view:<object>:<viewId>` for `getView`, `view-overrides:<object>` for
    `listViewOverrides`) are untouched and now pinned. (#3778)

- 38ab505: Retire the `global_nav` Studio designer surfaces, and track the `@objectstack` family at `17.0.0-rc.6` (objectstack#7100 / objectstack#6888).

  ## The retirement

  `global_nav` was an `ACTION_LOCATIONS` member no running-app surface ever rendered. The console's ⌘K palette (`app-shell/src/chrome/CommandPalette.tsx`) builds its groups from nav items, objects, dashboards, pages, reports, recent items, record search and theme; it holds no reference to `global_nav`, to `actionRendersAt`, or to any action-metadata source. An action declaring `locations: ['global_nav']` therefore never reached a user.

  The Studio designer previewed it anyway — a mock frame reading `⌘K · Command palette` with the author's button inside it. That is the sharp edge the maintainer's 2026-08-09 ruling on objectstack#6888 named: an authoring tool promising a surface the product does not have teaches authors, and every AI copying this corpus, to declare dead metadata. `@objectstack/spec` `17.0.0-rc.6` retired the member (7 members → 6) with a named rejection message; this release removes the designer surfaces that outlived it.

  - `metadata-admin/previews/ActionPreview.tsx` — the mock command-palette placement frame is gone. The metadata strip above it still ECHOES whatever `locations` the draft declares, deliberately: reporting what a (possibly stale) draft says is honest, whereas the frame CLAIMED the platform renders it.
  - `metadata-admin/inspectors/ActionDefaultInspector.tsx` — the `global_nav` entry is gone from `LOCATION_LABELS`. That map is typed `Record< ActionLocation, string >`, so the retirement reached it as a compile error rather than as a silently stale dropdown — the mechanism objectui#3017 installed, firing as designed.
  - `metadata-admin/previews/block-config.ts` — the `record:quick_actions` location dropdown no longer offers it, and both locale tables drop the now-orphaned `…option.location.global_nav` key.
  - `@object-ui/components`' `action:bar` doc comment is aligned. The component's published enum is `[...ACTION_LOCATIONS]`, so it followed the retirement on its own; only the prose was stale.

  `@object-ui/core`'s `ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation` is **unchanged and still answers a literal string match**. Narrowing it to the six live members would put a second rejection point beside the schema's — the tolerant-consumer shape the strict-contract rule forbids, inverted. Enforcement stays where it belongs: the parameter type is now six-membered so no type-correct caller can spell the retired value, and `ActionLocationSchema` rejects it by name at authoring and publish time.

  ## The dependency move

  All 37 `@objectstack/*` declarations across 30 `package.json` files move from `^17.0.0-rc.5` to `^17.0.0-rc.6`, and `pnpm-lock.yaml` resolves one copy of each family package at rc.6. The siblings move with `spec` because `client` / `formula` / `lint` pin it **exactly** — leaving them behind would keep two copies of the spec in the tree, the split brain objectui#3560 called out.

  Bumping the pin and repairing the fallout cannot be split: at rc.5 the `Record< ActionLocation, string >` above is missing a key, at rc.6 it has an excess one.

  ## Breaking, in FROM → TO form

  - **`@object-ui/types`' `Theme` now binds the spec's `Theme`, not `ThemeInput`.** rc.6 retired every `…Input` alias and moved the bare name onto the `z.input` side (`X` = `z.input`, `XParsed` = `z.infer`). The runtime shape and this package's exported name are unchanged — `Theme` was, and still is, the AUTHORING shape where `mode` is optional. Re-pointing at `ThemeParsed` would have been the silent swap.
  - **`SpecReport` / `SpecReportChart` re-point to `ReportParsed` / `ReportChartParsed`, and `SpecReportInput` / `SpecReportChartInput` to `Report` / `ReportChart`.** Same rename, same rule: each local alias keeps the SIDE it had at rc.5.
  - **`@object-ui/types` no longer re-exports `I18nObject`, `LocaleConfig`, `PluralRule`, `DateFormat` or `NumberFormat`** — all five were retired by rc.6. They were dead re-exports here: nothing in this repo imported them from `@object-ui/types` (`@object-ui/i18n`'s formatter vocabulary in `utils/spec-formatters.ts` is locally declared and never bound the spec symbols). `I18nLabel` survives and is unchanged as a name.
  - **`I18nLabel` itself widened from `string` to `string | Record< string, string >`** — rc.6 folded the retired `I18nObject`'s per-locale map into it and ships `resolveI18nLabel(label, locale)` as the shared resolver. Every read in this repo that lands in a text slot now goes through that resolver, so an inline map renders its locale instead of `[object Object]`. Reads the compiler cannot see are audited separately in objectui#4163.
  - **`@object-ui/types`' `GlobalFilterSchema` derives via `.safeExtend`, not `.extend`.** rc.6's `GlobalFilterSchema` carries a refinement and zod 4 refuses `.extend()` on a refined object outright, which threw at module load. `.safeExtend` is zod's prescribed replacement and KEEPS the refinement, so the spec's cross-field rule now also runs on this package's dialect — which is the intended behaviour, since the pinned divergences widen individual fields and were never meant to switch off a whole-object rule.

- 92250d6: One home for the number-display policy — and a percent stops meaning two different things between a list cell and a dashboard measure

  `formatDisplayNumber`, `shouldGroupDisplayNumber` and `DisplayNumberFormatOptions` move from `@object-ui/i18n` into `@object-ui/core`. `@object-ui/i18n` re-exports all three under the same names, so every existing import path keeps working unchanged and both spellings resolve to the same function object; nothing published was removed.

  The move is what fixes the bug. `@object-ui/core`'s `formatMeasure` needed exactly this policy and could not import it — `core` is the React-free engine and is a runtime dependency of React-free consumers (the `object-ui` VS Code extension, `@object-ui/data-objectstack`), while `i18n` depends on `i18next`/`react-i18next` and peer-depends on React. So `formatMeasure` carried a parallel `Intl` implementation, recorded at both ends as deliberate duplication, and the two drifted in the one place a hand-built string and `Intl` disagree. A German session read `1.234,5 %` from a list cell and `1.234,5%` from a dashboard measure showing the same number. The function is pure, so the boundary was never a property of the code — only of where the code sat; moving it down removes the obstacle instead of working around it. `core` imports nothing from `i18n`, so the new edge adds no cycle.

  **Behaviour change — a measure's percent sign now follows the locale.** `formatMeasure` appended a literal `%` in every locale; it now renders the locale's own percent convention, the same one the list-cell `formatPercent` has used since the fix to its own machine-locale defect. Measured to change output in de, fr, es, ru, sv, cs, fi (a no-break space appears before the sign), tr (the sign moves to the FRONT: `%1.234,5`) and ar (its own percent sign plus U+061C). English, Japanese and Chinese are byte-identical — their convention is a bare trailing sign — which is why this was invisible in an English session.

  **No numeral moves, in any locale, at any magnitude.** The obvious route to the locale's convention is `Intl`'s `style: 'percent'`, but that style expects a fraction, so a value already in percentage points would have to be divided by 100 for `Intl` to multiply it straight back — and that round trip is lossy. Measured, it moves 27,581 of 1,200,013 ordinary-magnitude en-US forms at rounding ties (`0.175` at two decimals becomes `0.17%` instead of `0.18%`), plus `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and everything from 1e23 up, where `100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000%` becomes `99,999,999,999,999,990,000,000%`. The percentage points are formatted directly instead, through a new `style: 'percentPoints'` on `DisplayNumberFormatOptions`; that route was measured to produce a byte-identical percent affix to `style: 'percent'` across all 171 locale tags tested while moving none of those 1,200,013 forms. Callers holding a fraction keep using `style: 'percent'`, whose behaviour is unchanged — naming the two cases apart is what stops the next caller from reaching for the lossy one.

  `@object-ui/i18n`'s entry declaration is byte-identical, but the declaration it points at now lives in `@object-ui/core` and the package gains that dependency, so it takes the same minor bump rather than a patch.

- c1d939f: One `SchemaNode`, and one label vocabulary — the union wins, and labels resolve where the locale lives

  Two packages published a type called `SchemaNode` and they were not the same type. `@object-ui/core` hand-declared `interface SchemaNode { type: string; … [key: string]: any }`; `@object-ui/types` exported `type SchemaNode = BaseSchema | string | number | boolean | null | undefined`, whose own doc comment names `'Plain string'` a valid node. Both were exported under one name from packages the same consumers import together, so which declaration a call site got depended on which package it happened to import from — #4548's canary measured 19 of 35 errors as exactly that collision. Core's declaration is now a re-export of types', so there is one declaration left to disagree with. Core's entry surface is unchanged: `dist/index.d.ts` is byte-identical across the change.

  Reconciling it exposed a real defect rather than a mechanical narrowing, which is why the first attempt was withdrawn instead of forced. The spec bridges write `spec.label` — the spec's `I18nLabel`, an INLINE locale map like `{ en: 'Owner', 'zh-CN': '负责人' }` — into `node.label`, and `BaseSchema.label` declared `string`. Under core's old index signature that assignment was invisibly `any`; under one honest `SchemaNode` it is a type error. `BaseSchema.label` and `.description` therefore now accept `string | I18nLabel`, and the two bridge assignments compile with their expressions untouched.

  Resolution happens at READ time, in the renderer, against the display locale — not at the bridge. Resolving at the bridge was measured unimplementable: it is a plain class method that cannot call a hook, `BridgeContext` declares no locale, and `updateContext()` has zero callers, so a bridge-resolved label would freeze one audience's language into the node tree with no re-translation channel. React's own invalidation re-translates for free at the read site.

  The widening turned every blind `schema.label`-as-string read into a named compiler error, and that inventory is the audit: it named four sites repo-wide, all one class — the label reaching a React child position, where a map does not render as `[object Object]` but THROWS `Objects are not valid as a React child`, failing the whole subtree. Three are `@object-ui/components` renderers (`filter-builder`, `sidebar-group`, `dropdown-menu`), which now resolve with the spec's own `resolveI18nLabel` against `useDisplayLocale()`. The fourth is `plugin-dashboard`'s `DashboardGridLayout` heading, which resolves with `pickLocalized` against the active UI language — matching the widget-title resolution already in that same component rather than putting two resolvers and two disagreeing locale channels in one render; the two resolvers are limb-for-limb twins with a parity test pinning them.

  One interface now carries both label vocabularies two properties apart — `label`/`description` are the spec's INLINE map, `ariaLabel` is the KEYED bundle reference — and each accepts the other's shape vacuously. That confusability is objectui#4167's known hazard, inherent to the spec's `I18nLabel` design; both shapes are named with cross-referenced doc comments stating which resolver owns which slot, and a pin asserts the two unions do not collapse into each other.

  Finally, the spec bridges declare their return type as `BaseSchema` instead of the union. Both bridges end in a single `return node` on an object literal, so the union described nothing real while forcing a narrowing at every read — 272 mechanical errors across five suites in the first round. That change is a type annotation only; the emitted JavaScript is byte-identical.

- 2459a3e: Retire `ActionEngine`'s event-mapping API (objectui#3368). `ActionEngine.addMapping()`,
  `ActionEngine.dispatch()`, the private `mappings` registry behind them, and the exported
  `ActionMapping` interface are removed under enforce-or-remove: all four were public surface
  of `@object-ui/core` with zero production callers. Nothing in the repo ever registered a
  mapping, so `dispatch()` had no reachable caller either, and every call site was in the
  engine's own test file.

  Breaking for anyone who typed against or called the removed declarations, marked `minor`
  per this repository's version-alignment convention (the major tracks `@objectstack`, never
  an API-break count). Actions are still entered by name (`executeAction`), by location
  (`getActionsForLocation`), by shortcut (`handleShortcut`) and in bulk (`executeBulk`) —
  only the event-keyed entry point is gone, and no runtime behaviour changes because no
  runtime path reached it.

  The three ways the retired condition gate had drifted from the `visible` contract that
  `getActionsForLocation` implements die with the path rather than being fixed on it: it
  entered on a raw truthy check (`condition: false` dispatched anyway), typed `condition` as
  `string` only (a `{ dialect: 'cel', source }` envelope could not reach the canonical
  `@objectstack/formula` engine), and evaluated without `throwOnError` (a throwing predicate
  failed OPEN, the opposite of `visible`'s fail-closed posture). Aligning the contract of an
  API nobody calls would only have widened behaviour nobody uses.

- fe52a04: `rowHeightToDensityMode` answers only for the five spec row heights — the coerce-to-`comfortable` fallback is gone

  Two surfaces narrow a list view's `rowHeight` onto the renderer's three-step
  density vocabulary, and since objectui#4352 they answered differently for the
  same off-spec input: `@object-ui/react`'s spec bridge declined to answer, while
  `@object-ui/core`'s `rowHeightToDensityMode` rehabilitated anything unknown into
  `comfortable`. One metadata-driven system, two answers for one input
  (objectui#4440).

  The strict answer wins, per AGENTS.md #0.1: a renderer-side rehabilitation of
  off-spec metadata is a second de-facto contract, and one strict contract beats N
  dialects — a bad `rowHeight` gets fixed at the producer, where the schema already
  rejects it. The five mappings themselves are untouched (`compact`/`short` →
  `compact`, `medium` → `comfortable`, `tall`/`extra_tall` → `spacious`), and the
  table keeps its `Record< RowHeight, … >` typing, so a row height added upstream
  still fails the build here.

  **Breaking semantics, deliberately graded `minor`** (this repo never publishes
  `major` — its major tracks `@objectstack`). Two things change:

  - **Published type.** `rowHeightToDensityMode` is exported from
    `@object-ui/core`, and its return widens from `DensityMode` to
    `DensityMode | undefined`. A host assigning the result straight into a
    `DensityMode` now has to say what an off-spec row height should mean to it.
  - **Rendered output, for input the spec already rejects.** `ListView` — the one
    in-repo caller — used to render an off-spec `rowHeight` one step looser than an
    ABSENT one (`comfortable`, 40px rows, vs `compact`, 32px). It now renders it
    exactly like an absent one, `compact`, which is also `ObjectGrid`'s own default.
    A sweep of this repo, the `objectstack` example apps and one downstream app
    found zero authored off-spec values, and the legacy `densityMode` alias cannot
    produce one (`DENSITY_MODE_TO_ROW_HEIGHT` is typed
    `Record< DensityMode, RowHeight >`).

  Also closed while retiring the branch: the lookup guarded membership with `in`,
  which walks the prototype chain, so `rowHeight: 'toString'` returned
  `Object.prototype.toString` — a function — from something typed `DensityMode`. It
  is an own-property check now.

- bb68488: Stop declaring 14 symbols under names `@objectstack/spec` owns at `17.0.0-rc.6`
  (objectui#4167, objectstack#4115).

  The rc.6 bump published nine names this repo already declared locally, on top of
  four that predate it — `check:spec-symbols` reported all thirteen at once, and a
  fourteenth (`GlobalFilterSchema`) appeared during the bump itself. Each was
  triaged on its own rather than blanket-renamed, because the right answer differs
  per symbol: five bind to the spec, three are renamed because the spec's
  same-named export means something else, five arrive by derivation, and one is a
  declared dialect with a written reason.

  **Breaking for importers of `@object-ui/react`, `@object-ui/app-shell` and
  `@object-ui/types`** — three exported names changed, because the spec exports the
  same name for a _different_ thing:

  | package               | was                | now                            | what the spec's same-named export actually is                                                                                                          |
  | :-------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `react` / `app-shell` | `MetadataState`    | `MetadataCacheState`           | a metadata item's LIFECYCLE state — `'draft' \| 'active' \| 'deprecated' \| 'archived'` (`MetadataStateSchema`, `@objectstack/spec/system`)            |
  | `react` / `app-shell` | `resolveI18nLabel` | `resolveKeyedI18nLabel`        | a resolver for the INLINE per-locale map (`{ en: 'Owner', 'zh-CN': '负责人' }`) against a BCP-47 locale                                                |
  | `types`               | `DateRangePreset`  | `FilterBuilderDateRangePreset` | the thirteen HISTORICAL dashboard filter-bar presets; this one is the filter-builder set, which adds eight FUTURE windows the dashboard schema rejects |

  `resolveI18nLabel` is the one where the collision had already started costing
  something. rc.6 widened `I18nLabel` from `string` to
  `string | Record< string, string >`, so the same authored value now reaches
  either resolver — and each answers wrongly, silently, for the other's input: the
  keyed one returns `undefined` for `{ en: 'Owner' }` (no `key`, no
  `defaultValue`), and the spec's reads `key` / `defaultValue` / `params` as locale
  tags. The rc.6 bump PR met this and aliased the spec's import as
  `resolveInlineI18nLabel` in five files, with hand-written comments at two of
  them. That is a review convention, which is what objectstack#4115 exists to
  replace with a rule — so `Keyed` is now the counterpart of that `Inline`, and the
  name says which vocabulary it resolves at every call site.

  **Eleven keep their names and are now imported or derived from the spec** instead
  of re-declared: `DATE_RANGE_PRESETS`, `NavigationMode`, `AddressValue`,
  `BreakpointColumnMap`, `BreakpointOrderMap`, `KanbanConfig`, `CalendarConfig`,
  `GanttConfig`, plus the three renamed above at their new names.

  **Four of the copies were losing information, not just duplicating it.**

  - **`GanttConfig` declared six keys and called itself canonical; rc.6's
    `GanttConfigSchema` declares seventeen.** The eleven it never mentioned —
    `parentField`, `typeField`, `baselineStartField`, `baselineEndField`,
    `groupByField`, `resourceView`, `assigneeField`, `effortField`, `capacity`,
    `quickFilters`, `autoZoomToFilter` — are all read by
    `plugin-gantt/src/ObjectGantt.tsx`, through a local `GanttConfigEx`
    intersection that existed only because this type did not carry them. It now
    derives from the spec, with `timeSegments` (shift segmentation) as the one
    genuinely local extension; the schema is `$loose` upstream, so that key is
    legal metadata rather than a second dialect.
  - **`GanttConfig.tooltipFields` carried the comment "not part of the upstream
    GanttConfigSchema".** It is, as of rc.6, so the key now arrives from the spec.
  - **`AddressValue` declared five of the spec's seven parts** — `countryCode` and
    `formatted` were missing, under a comment already claiming to be "the part
    names of `AddressSchema`". The widget still renders five inputs; binding the
    type stops it from asserting the platform cannot store the other two, and makes
    the `{ ...address }` write-through say so.
  - **`DATE_RANGE_PRESETS` was `Object.keys(PRESET_RANGES)`,** a third copy of a
    vocabulary the spec extracted in objectstack#4614 precisely to collapse — its
    own doc comment names this module as one of the three. It is now the spec's
    array by reference, and the local date-macro bounds table is pinned complete
    against it with `satisfies`, so a preset the schema gains without bounds here
    is a compile error rather than a filter that validates clean and then selects
    nothing.

  `NavigationMode` was one hop from the spec already (`NavigationConfig['mode']`);
  it is bound directly, with a both-directions type pin that it stays the same type
  as the config's own `mode`. `KanbanConfig` / `CalendarConfig` /
  `BreakpointColumnMap` / `BreakpointOrderMap` were exact hand copies of `$strict`
  schemas and are now re-exports — "still exact" is the argument for binding them,
  since a copy with nothing to protect can only drift.

  `GlobalFilterSchema` is the one ALLOW entry. It is the same spread-composition
  dialect as `SelectOptionSchema` next to it, and it collided only because rc.6's
  new refinement forced `.extend()` to be respelled as a `.shape` spread — which
  moved a derivation the guard could see into an object literal it deliberately
  does not descend into. The dialect is unchanged and its three divergences are
  pinned; which side moves on the refinement itself is objectui#4165.

  `@objectstack/spec` moves from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in
  `@object-ui/layout`: its public type surface now references the spec.

### Patch Changes

- ee26e65: Analytics: the dimension label net's fetch-and-memo glue is written once, not once per surface

  PR #4388 (objectui#4330) put the same React glue on two surfaces — the dashboard's `DatasetWidget` and plugin-report's dataset block. The resolution RULES were never duplicated (both call the same `@object-ui/core` helpers), but the wiring around them was: read the object schema through the host's authenticated `apiFetch`, keep the fetched metadata locale-free in state, derive the label maps in a render memo. Two copies meant two statements of the same two bug fixes, which is a drift surface rather than a defect — nothing a user could hit today, filed as objectui#4389 so it was retired deliberately.

  It is now split along the layer that can actually hold each half. `@object-ui/core` gains the React-free parts — `loadDimensionFieldMeta` (the base-object read composed with the dimension walk), `deriveDimensionLabelMaps` (the locale-applying derivation) and `dimensionOptionTranslator` (binding the bundle resolver to the object that OWNS a terminal field, which for a dotted path is the relationship target). `@object-ui/react` gains `useDatasetDimensionLabels` / `useDatasetDimensionMeta`, the React wiring that cannot live in core, beside the `useViewData` / `useElementDataSource` / `useDiscovery` hooks that already read `SchemaRendererContext` the same way. Both plugins consume it; the dashboard keeps its chart-only per-category colour and category-order derivation layered locally, since a table renders no palette.

  The card originally proposed `@object-ui/core` as the whole glue's home. That home was disproven by measurement and retired in the card's PM RULING #2: `SchemaRendererContext` is defined in `@object-ui/react`, which depends on core, so core importing it back is a cycle — and core is React-free by declaration, by content, and by the topology in AGENTS.md. objectui#3367 had already ruled this direction for the same family (core-canonical logic, react re-exports).

  Behaviour is unchanged by construction: same read count, same best-effort fallback, same memoization boundary. The two bug fixes are now stated once and pinned at the shared hook — the read rides the host's authenticated `apiFetch` (objectui#4121, pinned by asserting that a new channel re-issues the read, i.e. that it really is in the effect's deps), and the fetched metadata stays locale-free (objectui#4030 / PR #4324, pinned by switching language at runtime and asserting the labels flip with no second metadata read). All 39 assertions PR #4388 landed across both surfaces pass unchanged, and their files are byte-identical to before.

- 5900ac5: Analytics surfaces now run resolved select-option labels through the locale bundle — the chart legend and the related list on one page stop disagreeing

  A dashboard widget grouped by a `select` field rendered the option's authored English label while the related list beside it rendered the translation. The decisive evidence in objectui#4030 is the stored value `orion`: the chart read `Orion Engineered Carbons`, a string with no resemblance to the value and matching the object's `label` byte for byte. So the analytics path had already RESOLVED the option label — it simply never ran the result through the i18n bundle before display. (`domestic → Domestic` differs from its value by case alone, which is why the first diagnosis, "the report groups by stored value", was wrong.)

  There is exactly one resolution channel and this change reuses it rather than adding a chart-side dialect: `fieldOptionLabel` from `useObjectLabel`, i.e. `{ns}.fieldOptions.<object>.<field>.<value>` — the convention `@objectstack/spec` names objectui as the reader of, and the one list, form, kanban and record-picker surfaces already translate select options through. The bundle is applied ONCE, at the output of the label net that landed in objectui#4053/#4263, on the shared option list every consumer reads: chart axis and legend, the table/pivot cells of a dotted dimension, that table's CSV export, per-category colours and the declared category order. `@object-ui/core` gains `localizeFieldOptions` (the pure mirror of `translateOptions`), an optional translator on `buildDimensionLabelMap`, and `resolveDimensionFieldMeta` — the same single relationship walk `resolveDimensionFieldOptions` performs, now keeping the object that OWNS the terminal field, because for `crm_account.industry` the bundle key is `crm_account`, not the dataset's base object.

  Two properties the fix is shaped around. The rows reach this net keyed either way — by stored value when the server did not resolve the dimension, by the English label when it did (ADR-0021) — and the reported screen is the second case, so the map answers to both keys and lands on the same translated display. And identity is untouched: `relabelDimensions` still rewrites display only, so a drilled chart segment clicked as `欧励隆` filters by `orion`, bucket ids and pivot totals keep their raw keys, and an option with no bundle entry (or an `en` console) renders exactly the authored label it renders today.

  The per-locale work moved from the metadata fetch into the render, so switching language now re-labels in place instead of waiting for a refetch.

  Not covered, and unchanged here: a LOCAL select dimension on a table/pivot, whose label the server resolves and whose client-side net is deliberately off (objectui#4263), and a dashboard global filter's own field label, which has no object name in its metadata to key a bundle lookup with — tracked on objectui#4030.

- aca27fa: The multi-dimension pivot branch buckets a null first-dimension value instead of dropping its bar (objectui#4497)

  `buildChartSeries`' pivot branch (2+ dimensions, single measure) bucketed rows by `String(xRaw ?? '')` but wrote the RAW value into the emitted row, so a null first-dimension value produced `{status: null, Low: 3}` and reached recharts with a null category — which draws no mark. Measured at the DOM: a two-group pivot drew ONE bar, and an all-null pivot drew axes and gridlines with zero bar rectangles and no empty state. That is the same mechanism objectui#4466 fixed one branch below, on the branch that card deliberately left pinned as-is until the pivot's own bucketing had been measured.

  The pivot now maps a null/undefined first-dimension VALUE to the same bucket label the single-dimension branch uses — `ChartSeriesOptions.nullCategoryLabel`, defaulting to `NULL_CATEGORY_LABEL`. One doctrine, one predicate, two call sites; no new export, and every existing call site compiles and behaves identically.

  The bucket KEY is untouched, which is what keeps this a display fix: `String(xRaw ?? '')` still decides which rows share a bar, so every existing grouping is byte-identical and only the label the bucket carries changes. Rows that lack the category key entirely are still not bucketed — that shape is a dimension grouped by but never projected (framework#4033), a different defect with a different answer.

  Drill-through needed no change, which was measured rather than assumed: the pivot's emitted rows are AGGREGATED, so they are not index-aligned with `drillRawRows` and the one production caller (`DatasetWidget.handleChartDrill`) already drills by SEARCHING the raw rows through `findChartSeriesRow`. Those raw rows still carry their null, and objectui#4466's label-matching covers the multi-dimension arm as well as the single-dimension one, so the newly-visible bar resolves to the right record. Pinned at both levels so a regression in either half surfaces as the dead click it would be.

- 613b167: A dataset dimension on a dotted relationship path now renders its option labels instead of the raw stored enum

  A `DatasetDimension` whose `field` is a relationship path (`crm_account.industry`) got no select-option resolution at all: the chart plotted `education`, `finance`, `manufacturing` — the database column, unresolved — while the **same underlying field** reached as a **local** dimension rendered `Education`, `Finance`, `Manufacturing` beside it on the same dashboard. Nothing errored, so the widget just quietly showed database enum values to end users; on a non-English deployment those are words that appear nowhere else in the UI, since every form and list shows the translated label.

  The label lookup read options as `baseObject.fields[<path>]`, which only ever matches the local spelling. For a dotted path the options live on the **related** object, so the lookup missed and the renderer fell through to the stored value.

  The object-resolution step of that one lookup now walks the path: each segment before the last must be a declared relationship (`lookup` / `master_detail`, target read from `reference` / `reference_to` / `referenceTo` / `reference_to_object`), and the terminal field's options are read off the object that actually owns it. This is the same lookup for both spellings rather than a dotted-path variant beside it — a single-segment path never enters the walk and resolves exactly as before, so the local and joined paths cannot drift apart. Multi-hop paths (`crm_account.owner.department`) resolve too, which is the shape the dataset designer already emits.

  Hops ride the caller's existing `GET /meta/object/:name` channel — the same authenticated read that fetched the base object — so no new fetch layer is introduced, and objects are fetched once per resolution even when several dimensions share a prefix. Every failure stays best-effort: a segment that is not a relationship, a target that cannot be loaded, or a terminal field with no options yields no mapping and the raw value survives, exactly as it does today.

  Applies to both surfaces that carried this lookup: dashboard dataset widgets (`DatasetWidget`) and the chart view's dataset path (`ObjectChart`).

  Scope: this ends at "the label is in hand". Whether that label then passes through the i18n bundle is a separate gap tracked upstream as objectstack#5076.

- abb0f81: A dashboard date filter's default has one spelling again — the bare preset name — and the `{ preset }` object becomes a documented legacy alias with a retirement window

  `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0-rc.6 added a cross-field refinement to `GlobalFilterSchema` holding a `type: 'date'` filter's `defaultValue` to three spellings: a preset NAME (`last_7_days`), an ISO date (`2026-01-15`), or a date-macro token (`{today}`). objectui's derived schema had widened `defaultValue` to `z.any()` and did not carry the refinement, so it accepted `{ preset: 'last_7_days' }` — metadata the platform refuses. That is the tolerant-consumer shape where the designer goes green and the save fails server-side, and it is now closed: the refinement is adopted, the widening is retired, and the object form is refused with the spec's own message.

  Per the maintainer ruling on objectui#4165, the spec stays strict and the bare preset name is the single canonical spelling. `{ preset }` is handled as an ADR-0089 legacy alias rather than by a permanently tolerant schema: `liftLegacyGlobalFilterDefault` / `liftLegacyDashboardFilterDefaults` (new exports on `@object-ui/types`) convert it to the bare name, `@object-ui/core`'s `resolveDashboardFilterDefs` applies the lift when it reads a stored dashboard, and the console's dashboard designer applies it as the document enters the editable draft so the next save persists the canonical spelling. The retirement window is recorded at the read site: the alias may be removed in `@object-ui/types` 18.0.0, and every lift warns on the console so a surviving legacy document is visible rather than silently tolerated.

  No stored dashboard has to change for this release. The lift means a document carrying the object form keeps loading and rendering exactly as before — measured, not assumed: a legacy declaration already resolved correctly, because `{ preset }` also happens to be the runtime value shape objectui's own date filters use, and that coincidence is why the object form went unnoticed for so long. What changes is that the declaration is now canonicalized on read and rewritten on save, so the two spellings converge instead of accreting.

  The other two divergences in this schema — the bare-string `options` shorthand and the optional `optionsFrom.labelField` — are unaffected. Carrying the spec's refinement while keeping them needed a new composition: a refined object schema in zod 4 rejects `.extend()` and `.omit()` outright and types every `.safeExtend()` override as `never`, so objectui's schema now spreads the spec's shape and re-attaches the spec's object-level rules by delegating to the spec schema itself. Nothing restates the spec's grammar, and a refinement the spec adds later flows in with no change here.

- 7e4f0e5: fix(dashboard,i18n): KPI cards and dashboard filters resolve authored labels instead of dropping them (#4032)

  A `type: 'metric'` dashboard widget rendered raw English while every other widget
  type on the same dashboard rendered the translation, and dashboard filter chips
  rendered `[object Object]` or the raw stored value. Both come from the same
  cause: authored labels reaching a render site that could not read the
  vocabulary `@objectstack/spec` actually admits.

  - **KPI cards rejoin the widget translation channel.** The self-contained
    `metric` branch built its own label from the raw `widget.title`, so the
    `{ns}.dashboards.{dash}.widgets.{id}.title` value the renderer had already
    resolved was computed and thrown away. It now reads that channel like every
    other widget header.
  - **The three private `resolveLabel` copies** (`DashboardRenderer`,
    `MetricWidget`, `MetricCard`) are gone. Each read the retired
    `{ key, defaultValue }` key-reference form and ended `defaultValue || key`, so
    handed the inline per-locale map the spec admits today they returned nothing —
    a KPI card with a map title rendered the literal string `metric`. All three
    now use `pickLocalized`, the resolver already used for this vocabulary
    elsewhere in the package.
  - **Dashboard filter labels and static option labels resolve per locale.**
    `DashboardFilterDef.label` widens to `string | I18nLabel`, the filter bar
    resolves before rendering (fixing `[object Object]: All` in the trigger, and
    in `aria-label` / `placeholder`), and the `def.label || def.name` gate now
    tests the RESOLVED string — an object is always truthy, so it never reached
    the fallback before.
  - **Option labels are no longer discarded.** `normalizeFilterOptions` coerced a
    map label to the raw stored value in every locale, English included, so
    `{ value: 'domestic', label: { en: 'Domestic', … } }` displayed as `domestic`.
    The pair shape is still normalized; the label vocabulary is preserved for the
    render side to resolve.
  - **`DashboardComponentSchema.globalFilters` is bound to the spec's
    `GlobalFilter`** instead of restated by hand. The restatement was both too
    narrow (`label?: string`, which is what made these read sites invisible to
    `tsc`) and too wide (it declared a bare-string option shorthand the spec
    rejects at publish).

  Plain-string labels are unaffected and render byte-identically.

- 49ae9f4: Pivot buckets encode an empty dimension value as JSON `null`, so it no longer collides with a row whose value is literally the placeholder character

  objectstack#5473 / objectstack#5665 replaced the pivot's delimiter-joined ids
  with `JSON.stringify`, because every delimiter that had been tried — an empty
  string, a plain space, a control character — assumed the data would not contain
  it, and each assumption failed on ordinary data. This closes the last place the
  same assumption survived: the ids were JSON, but the VALUES fed into them were
  spelled `String(row[d] ?? '∅')`, so an absent dimension value became the
  ordinary string `"∅"` and shared a bucket with a row whose value literally is
  that character (U+2205). One bucket, later row overwriting the earlier one — the
  cell showed a different row's measure, the overwritten row was unreachable, and
  drill-through followed the same wrong index into the wrong records, all without
  an error. The trigger requires that character to appear as a dimension value, so
  this is the assumption being removed rather than a defect users hit today.

  An empty value now encodes as JSON `null`, which `JSON.stringify` renders as a
  bare `null` that no string can spell. The normalization lives in
  `@object-ui/core` as `pivotDimensionValue` (absent ⇒ `null`, everything else ⇒
  its string form) rather than at each call site, because a placeholder spelled by
  a caller is a placeholder that can collide again — which is exactly how this one
  survived the previous fix. `pivotBucketId` accepts `Array<string | null>`
  accordingly; that is a widening, so existing callers passing `string[]` are
  unaffected.

  Both renderers' bucket keys move together, which the fix requires: a bucket id
  and the subtotal map keyed by it are built from the same expression, so changing
  one alone would split the headers while the subtotal map still merged, landing
  every column subtotal under the wrong header. In `plugin-dashboard`'s
  `DatasetWidget` that is the row bucket id, the column bucket id, the cell key,
  and both the `rowTotalById` and `colTotalById` lookups; in `plugin-report`'s
  `DatasetReportRenderer` the single `bucketId` helper already feeds all five.

  The dashboard's column bucket id also stops being a bare string and becomes a
  one-element tuple through the same shared encoder. It was the one id in the
  family still built by hand, on the reasoning that a single value needs no
  boundary — true of the boundary, false of everything else the encoder does, and
  it is why the across axis kept carrying this collision after the row ids were
  fixed.

  No display change: these placeholders only ever entered ids, never labels. An
  unset dimension still renders through `formatDimensionValue` exactly as before,
  and data containing neither an absent value nor that character buckets
  identically — the ids are opaque lookup keys, never parsed back into a value,
  never shown, never persisted.

- d6aa172: Retire `params.newTab` on a url action — `openIn: 'new-tab'` is the sanctioned spelling

  `ActionRunner`'s navigator read a legacy `params.newTab` escape hatch below `openIn` and above the external-URL heuristic. That read is removed, executing the objectstack#6828 maintainer ruling of 2026-08-10, whose contract half shipped in objectstack PR #7375: the url-side readings of an object-form `params` are retired, not renamed.

  Nothing that ever validated can regress. `params` is declared as `z.array(ActionParamSchema)`, so an object-form `params` has always failed the props parse — the fallback could only fire on a stack the spec refuses. The removal also closes a collision hazard: a params dialog declaring a field named `newTab` had the user's own collected input silently steering navigation.

  `openIn: 'self' | 'new-tab'`, the legacy `navigate.newTab` modifier on the `navigation` shape, and the external/relative default are all unchanged.

- 9461dd3: Form actions no longer carry a record id across an object boundary (#4292).

  `ActionRunner.executeForm` forwarded `/forms/:name?recordId=<id>` unconditionally,
  and that URL says nothing about which object the id belongs to — so the form route
  resolved it against the FormView's own target object. When an action fired from a
  record of a DIFFERENT object and ids collide across objects (per-table integer
  keys), the form silently prefilled and, since the route learned to honour the param,
  `PATCH`ed a same-id record of the wrong object.

  - **Producer**: the id is forwarded only when the firing context record's object
    (`context.objectName`) matches the target view's object; on a mismatch no id is
    forwarded, preserving create semantics. When it IS forwarded, the object travels
    with it as `?recordObject=`.
  - **Consumer**: `/forms/:name` refuses — no record read, no write — when
    `recordObject` disagrees with the FormView's object. A URL without the param
    behaves exactly as before, so existing deep links are unaffected.

## 17.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c3b01a7: Give composite and grouped field widgets a real accessible name: the form renderer now associates its label by IDREF for widgets that declare `labelling: 'group'`, instead of emitting a `<label for>` that nothing labelable answers (objectui#3961).

  Six widgets rendered a visible group label that named **nothing** in the accessibility tree. Measured in a real form, one field per row, reading each label's `for` against the DOM:

  ```
  address      for=…-form-item -> MISSING            byLabelText=0   role+name=0
  geolocation  for=…-form-item -> MISSING            byLabelText=0   role+name=0
  checkboxes   for=…-form-item -> div                byLabelText=0   role+name=0
  radio        for=…-form-item -> div[radiogroup]    byLabelText=0   role+name=0
  rating       for=…-form-item -> div                byLabelText=0   role+name=0
  file         for=…-form-item -> div[role=button]   byLabelText=0   role+name=0
  ```

  Two shapes, one outcome. `address` / `geolocation` spread the host's id onto their first sub-input and then replaced it with that input's own unique id (objectui#3343, correct in itself), so the `for` named an id no element carried — clicking "Shipping Address" did nothing and the group label was absent from the accessibility tree entirely. `checkboxes` / `radio` / `rating` / `file` kept the id, but on a `div`: a `<label for>` on a non-labelable element is inert HTML — `HTMLLabelElement.control` is `null`, so it activates nothing and contributes no name. A screen reader heard "Street Address", "City", "Alpha", "Beta" — never which group they belonged to.

  The fix is the WAI-ARIA group pattern, driven by a DECLARATION rather than by the host guessing at widget DOM:

  - `@object-ui/core` — `ComponentMeta` gains `labelling?: 'control' | 'group'`. Additive and optional; absent means `'control'`, which is every existing component's behaviour.
  - `@object-ui/components` — the form renderer reads it. For a `'group'` field the `<FormLabel>` publishes an `id` and drops its `for`, and the widget receives `aria-labelledby`. The single-control path is unchanged down to the attribute: no id on the label, no `aria-labelledby` key on the widget, so no field acquires a second naming channel. `ui/form.tsx` is untouched (Shadcn no-touch) — both halves travel as ordinary props, since `<FormLabel>` spreads props after its own `htmlFor`.
  - `@object-ui/fields` — the six audited widgets declare `labelling: 'group'`. `address` / `geolocation` move the host id (and only the id) from their first sub-input to the group container; `checkboxes` / `rating` answer a host-supplied `aria-labelledby` with `role="group"`; `radio` keeps Radix's more specific `radiogroup`; `file` takes the name on its dropzone with no invented group layer, because it has exactly one control that merely happens not to be labelable.

  No new key in the widget props contract: `aria-*` is already declared on it and forwarded by `toDomProps`, the same channel `aria-required` (objectui#3290) travels.

  Deliberately unchanged: sub-labels keep naming their own inputs (`aria-labelledby` overrides `<label for>`, so putting the group name on the first sub-input would have replaced "Street Address" with the field name — the concatenated-name outcome this issue rejected), `aria-describedby` stays on the first focusable sub-input where focus can reach it (objectui#3318), the sub-input ids of objectui#3343 do not move, and standalone rendering — the inline grid editor, a bare SDUI node, where nobody hands down an id and there is no host label to point at — emits no role and no IDREF at all.

  A widget that does not declare itself keeps the old `for`, which the label-association tests report as an association resolving to a non-labelable element. Silence was the failure mode being fixed; the default path stays loud.

- 48132f7: Track the `@objectstack` family at `17.0.0-rc.5` (objectui#3560).

  The pin moves from `^17.0.0-rc.2` to `^17.0.0-rc.5` across all 37 declarations in
  30 `package.json` files, and the sibling `@objectstack/*` packages (`client` /
  `formula` / `lint`) move with it — they pin `@objectstack/spec` **exactly**, so
  leaving them behind would keep a second copy of the spec in the tree and have
  `@objectstack/lint` validating against schemas that still accept the keys rc.3–rc.5
  retire. `pnpm-lock.yaml` now resolves one copy of each of the six family packages
  (`spec` / `client` / `core` / `formula` / `lint` / `sdui-parser`), all at rc.5.

  Bumping the pin and repairing the fallout cannot be split: the pin alone reddens
  CI, and the code alone targets a shape that is not in effect yet.

  ## A live bug this upgrade fixes

  **`ObjectStackDataSource.delete()` never emitted its mutation event, and resolved
  `undefined` instead of a boolean.** `@objectstack/client`'s `DeleteDataResult`
  declared a key called `deleted` — a key no schema has ever declared and no server
  path has ever returned on `DELETE /data/:object/:id`. So `result.deleted`
  compiled and read `undefined` at runtime: the guard never fired, a successful
  delete notified no subscriber, and every consumer's cache stayed stale.
  objectstack#5638 corrected the interface to the schema's `success`; following the
  rename is what restores both behaviours. Nothing in this repo had to change shape
  for it — the code was already asking the right question of the wrong key.

  ## Breaking, in FROM → TO form

  - **The five `@objectstack/spec/ui` interaction-config modules are gone** —
    touch / dnd / keyboard / animation / offline, 32 defs and 64 exports
    (objectstack#4988, PR objectstack#5321). None of them had an authoring door: no
    metadata document could ever carry one of these blocks, so a stack that parsed
    before the retirement parses byte-for-byte the same after it. `@object-ui/types`
    drops the 32 `export type` re-exports. The vocabulary each one's only real
    consumer needs is now declared by that consumer, which is the remedy the spec's
    own retirement ledger prescribes ("declare that union locally — it is your
    client's policy, not the platform's"):

    - `@object-ui/react`'s `useOffline` owns `OfflineStrategy`, `ConflictResolution`,
      `PersistStorageType`, `EvictionPolicyType`, `OfflineConfig`,
      `OfflineCacheConfig`, `OfflineSyncConfig`;
    - `@object-ui/core`'s `DndProtocol` / `KeyboardProtocol` own `DndConfig`,
      `DragItem`, `DropZone`, `DragConstraint`, `DragHandle`, `DropEffect`,
      `KeyboardNavigationConfig`, `KeyboardShortcut`, `FocusManagement`,
      `FocusTrapConfig`;
    - `@object-ui/types`' `mobile` module owns `SpecGestureConfig`,
      `SwipeGestureConfig`, `PinchGestureConfig`, `LongPressGestureConfig`,
      `TouchTargetConfig`, `TouchInteraction` (plus a new `SPEC_GESTURE_TYPES`
      runtime tuple), so `@object-ui/mobile`'s import paths are unchanged.

    Every shape is moved verbatim — same keys, same members, same optionality — so
    no hook or bridge changes behaviour. Consumers importing these names from
    `@object-ui/types` must import them from the owning package instead. Note the
    spec's _surviving_ `ConnectorConflictResolution` (`/integration`, connector sync)
    and `ConflictResolutionStrategy` (`/api`, route merge policy) are **different
    concepts** — do not re-point at them.

  - **`@object-ui/types` no longer re-exports `NotificationAction` or `EmbedConfig`**
    (objectstack#5015, PR objectstack#5300). Both were published `ui` vocabulary with
    no authoring door; no notification action was ever parsed from metadata and no
    iframe route ever read an embed config. The presentation enums
    (`NotificationType` / `NotificationSeverity` / `NotificationPosition`) and
    `SharingConfig` **survive** and are untouched — public form sharing still gates
    the anonymous endpoints on `allowAnonymous` + `publicLink`.
    `@object-ui/core`'s `SharingProtocol` keeps `resolveEmbedConfig` /
    `generateEmbedCode` against a locally declared `EmbedConfig`, so its surface is
    unchanged.
  - **`ThemeEngine` stops emitting nine retired CSS variable groups**
    (objectstack#5021 option 2, PR objectstack#5289). `theme.animation`,
    `theme.zIndex` and five typography groups (`fontSize` / `fontWeight` /
    `lineHeight` / `letterSpacing`, plus `fontFamily.heading` / `fontFamily.mono`)
    are tombstones the schema now rejects by name, so `--duration-*`, `--timing-*`,
    `--z-*`, `--font-size-*`, `--font-weight-*`, `--line-height-*`,
    `--letter-spacing-*`, `--font-heading` and `--font-mono` had become structurally
    dead code — no author could produce the input that reached them.
    `generateAnimationVars` and `generateZIndexVars` are removed from
    `@object-ui/core`, and `@object-ui/types` drops `Animation` / `ZIndex` /
    `AnimationSchema` / `ZIndexSchema`. **`theme.customVars` is the declared — and
    since #5021 the only — door**: each entry is emitted verbatim as
    `--<key>: <value>`, so a `--z-modal` or a `--duration-fast` goes there now.
    LIVE emission is untouched byte for byte: `colors`, `borderRadius`, `shadows`,

    (objectstack#5832, PR objectstack#5976 — objectui#3499). The spec renamed its
    5-value UI subset because `schemaNameFromExportKey` strips the `Schema` suffix,
    so the 5-value and 7-value enums both published as `shared/HttpMethod` and the
    later write won — the emitted JSON Schema and reference page described only one
    of them. **The runtime domain is unchanged and this repo's exported names are
    unchanged**; this follows the rename without touching cross-package semantics.
    Deliberately NOT re-pointed at the spec's bare `HttpMethod`: that is the 7-value
    enum, and widening to it would let `method: 'HEAD'` compile and then throw in
    `HttpRequestSchema.parse()`.
  - **`dashboard.widgets[].actionUrl` / `actionType` / `actionIcon` / `aria` are

    dashboard widget has no action button and never had one — every action the
    dashboard dispatches comes from `header.actions[]` — and no renderer ever applied
    the widget `aria`, so it promised accessibility compliance it did not deliver.
    A stale dashboard now gets a named error telling it where the affordance moved,
    instead of silently losing it. Run `os migrate meta --from 16` to rewrite.

### Patch Changes

- 6719877: `condition: false` now actually prevents the action from executing (objectui#3872)

  `ActionRunner.execute` — the engine's public execution entry, shared by every
  action surface — gated conditional execution on `if (action.condition)`, i.e. on
  the raw value's TRUTHINESS. Truthiness cannot answer the question the gate needs
  answered ("did the author declare a condition?"), and on this key it answered in
  the over-permissive direction: `condition: false` fell on `if (false)`, so the
  whole block was skipped, `evaluateCondition` was never consulted, and the action
  executed. Measured with a call-counting handler:

  - `condition: false` — handler ran: **true**, result `{ success: true }`
  - `condition: { dialect: 'cel', source: 'false' }` — handler ran: false, result `{ success: false, error: 'Action condition not met' }`

  Two spellings of the same statement, opposite outcomes. `false` is the most
  explicit "never execute this" metadata can carry — and what a template that
  switches an action off emits — so the direction matters: the action really ran,
  possibly writing. This is the over-permission half of the objectui#3492 family
  (the `disabled` gate one line below is objectui#3848, whose defect pointed the
  other way).

  The gate now asks whether a `condition` gate is DECLARED before evaluating.
  "Nothing to evaluate" is read from core's single predicate normalizer
  (`toPredicateInput`, which maps `''`, `null`, an empty-`source` envelope and
  non-predicate values to `undefined`), plus the whitespace-only string, which the
  normalizer wraps rather than collapses — objectui#3850's ruling on the scope of
  "empty predicate", the same one the `disabled` gate already applies. Once the
  door asks the right question the verdict needs no boolean branch of its own:
  `evaluateCondition` returns a boolean argument verbatim.

  **Behaviour change surface, deliberately one-directional and one row wide.**
  Exactly one shape changes verdict — a declared boolean `false`, from executing to
  refused (`{ success: false, error: 'Action condition not met' }`, the message the
  key already used). Everything else is byte-identical: `condition: true`, an
  absent `condition`, and truthy expressions/envelopes still execute; falsy
  expressions, falsy CEL envelopes and falsy `${…}` templates are still refused,
  as before; the three empty predicates (`''`, whitespace-only, an empty-`source`
  envelope) still execute, now because nothing was declared rather than because
  `if ('')` happened to be falsy; and non-predicate junk (`0`, `{}`) still
  executes — a value that is not a predicate must not decide an action's fate,
  which is the fail-open posture this module already committed to for `disabled`.
  So this change can only start refusing execution, never start allowing it — the
  mirror image of objectui#3848's fix.

  `ActionDef.condition` is widened to `string | boolean` to match what the gate now
  honours (and the `disabled` key beside it). This is not a lenient consumer
  alias: the boolean was always accepted at runtime through the interface's index
  signature, it was simply ignored.

  The value handed to the evaluator is deliberately left RAW rather than normalized
  first, for the same reason as objectui#3848 with the sign flipped:
  `toPredicateInput` wraps unconditionally, so an already-templated `'${x}'`
  becomes `'${${x}}'`, fails to parse, returns verbatim and coerces to a constant
  `true` — on `disabled` that blocks everything, on `condition` it would EXECUTE
  everything. That normalizer defect is objectui#3871; a tripwire next to the new
  pins goes red the day it is fixed.

- 56ff091: An empty `disabled` predicate no longer refuses to run the action (objectui#3848)

  `ActionRunner.execute` — the engine's public execution entry, shared by every
  action surface — gated on `action.disabled != null && action.disabled !== false`
  and handed the value straight to `evaluateCondition`. That function documents one
  default for "there is no condition here": return `true`, meaning
  _visible/enabled_. On `disabled`, `true` means BLOCKED. So every empty predicate
  was read as "disabled": the handler was never invoked and the caller got
  `{ success: false, error: 'Action is disabled' }` — a state the metadata never
  declared. Measured with a call-counting handler:

  - `disabled: ''` — handler ran: false
  - `disabled: '   '` (whitespace only) — handler ran: false
  - `disabled: { dialect: 'cel', source: '' }` (the empty envelope `objectstack build` can emit) — handler ran: false

  After objectui#3842 / objectui#3849 fixed the renderer halves, this was live
  user-visible behaviour: the button became clickable and clicking it returned
  `Action is disabled` — the renderer and the execution entry disagreeing about one
  predicate value, the shape objectui#3314 already paid for once.

  The gate now asks whether a `disabled` gate is DECLARED — whether there is a
  condition to reach a verdict on — before evaluating. "Nothing to evaluate" is
  read from core's single predicate normalizer (`toPredicateInput`, which maps
  `''`, `null`, an empty-`source` envelope and non-predicate values to
  `undefined`), plus the whitespace-only string, which the normalizer wraps rather
  than collapses and which `evaluateCondition` itself calls "no condition"
  (`evalRowPredicate` applies the same blank-source rule).

  **Behaviour change surface, deliberately one-directional.** Only values with
  nothing to evaluate change, and only from blocked to allowed: `''`,
  whitespace-only, an empty-`source` envelope, and non-predicate junk (`0`, `{}`,
  which previously coerced to "disabled"). `disabled: true`, a truthy expression
  and a truthy CEL envelope still block; `disabled: false` and an absent `disabled`
  still run; no expression- or envelope-valued predicate changes verdict. The
  existing `catch { isDisabled = false }` fail-open posture is untouched, and this
  change can only stop blocking things, never start.

  The value handed to the evaluator is deliberately left RAW rather than normalized
  first. `evaluateCondition(toPredicateInput(x))` is not interchangeable with
  `evaluateCondition(x)` for a string that is already a `${…}` template:
  `toPredicateInput` assumes a bare expression and wraps unconditionally, so
  `'${x}'` becomes `'${${x}}'`, fails to parse, returns verbatim, and coerces to a
  constant `true` — a template-spelled predicate evaluated that way is ALWAYS
  "disabled", whatever it says. That normalizer defect is filed as objectui#3871
  (it is live at the action renderers and `ActionEngine`, while `SchemaRenderer` and
  `page:header` evaluate the raw value and pin the correct verdict); a tripwire next
  to the new pins goes red the day it is fixed. Two rows therefore still differ
  between the execution and renderer paths, each recorded with its owning issue:
  the empty envelope (objectui#3850 owns the renderer half's scope ruling) and the
  `${…}` spelling (objectui#3871).

- 4bc6c23: Converge dashboard widget `compareTo` on the executor's `{ kind, dimension? }` contract, and make the dataset path actually render a comparison

  `CompareToConfig` was a three-branch union (`'previousPeriod' | 'previousYear' | { offset }`). `@objectstack/spec` collapsed it to the shape the analytics executor already implements — `DatasetCompareTo`, a plain strict object `{ kind: 'previousPeriod' | 'previousYear'; dimension?: string }` (objectstack#5011) — so this renderer now reads that one shape:

  - `shiftFilterByCompareTo` / `compareToTrendLabelKey` dispatch on `compareTo.kind`. The `{ offset }` duration shift is gone: `{ offset: '1y' }` is `kind: 'previousYear'`, while `'7d'` / `'1M'` have no faithful target and are restated by the author on the widget's own `filter` plus `kind: 'previousPeriod'`. No trend label key is retired — the offset arm resolved to `vsPreviousPeriod`, which survives as the `previousPeriod` fallback.
  - `DatasetWidget` no longer discards part of `compareTo`. It used to forward only the object form because the two string forms had no meaning downstream; with one shape there is nothing to discard, and a stale string is now invalid metadata rejected where it is authored rather than silently reinterpreted here.
  - **The comparison now actually runs on the dataset path.** A widget states its window in its own `filter` (a date macro, or the dashboard date-range filter merged in), but the executor shifts a `timeDimensions` entry carrying a `dateRange` — so a dataset widget asking for a comparison got "compareTo needs a dated window to shift" and rendered none. When (and only when) a comparison is requested, the resolved filter's bounded date windows are lowered into `selection.timeDimensions[].dateRange` and moved out of `runtimeFilter` (a copy left behind would intersect the shifted window with the current one and empty every comparison column). Which dimension gets shifted stays the executor's decision: every window found is lowered under the name the author wrote, and zero or two candidates surfaces the executor's own error, listing them.
  - The `<measure>__compare` columns that come back are now shown: a delta + window label on KPI widgets, a comparison column on tables, and a `variant: 'comparison'` overlay series on charts — the same treatment and the same `dashboard.trend.*` labels the inline object-provider widgets already use.

- e06810e: `PageComponentSchema.dataSource` is now consumed instead of discarded — a
  `list-view` page component can reference a **saved view by name** for the first
  time, and writing the binding no longer breaks the component
  (objectstack#5576).

  The spec declares a per-element data binding on every page component —
  `dataSource: { object, view?, filter?, sort?, limit? }` — and objectui read none
  of it. `ViewDataProvider.resolveElementDataSource` forwarded
  `filter`/`sort`/`limit` and dropped `view` entirely, and had no caller outside its
  own test; nothing mapped `object` onto the `objectName` a list actually reads. So
  "reference a saved view by name" was published, validated and inert, and every
  page that wanted a saved view's columns/filter/sort had to inline a second copy of
  them — the drift the binding exists to remove.

  Writing the binding also **broke** the block, for a reason unrelated to `view`:
  `SchemaRenderer` spread the schema's `dataSource` metadata onto the component as a
  React prop, and that is the prop name the host uses to inject the data-source
  ADAPTER. The plain `{ object, view }` object shadowed the adapter, so the first
  `dataSource.find(…)` threw `dataSource.find is not a function` and `list-view`
  rendered "Couldn't load records" — a spec-compliant component failing next to
  identical ones that omitted the binding.

  - `@object-ui/react` — `SchemaRenderer` no longer spreads `schema.dataSource` as a
    prop (it is metadata, like `visibleWhen`); renderers read it off `schema`. An
    explicit React `dataSource` prop is unaffected. New
    `useElementDataSource(schema, dataSource?)` hook resolves a binding, fetching
    the named saved view from the object definition's `listViews` and the metadata
    overlay's `listViews()`.
  - `@object-ui/core` — new `isElementDataSourceConfig` / `collectSavedViews` /
    `resolveSavedView` / `composeElementDataSource`, and `resolveElementDataSource`
    now honours `view` through an optional `DataFetcher.fetchViews`, reporting an
    unresolvable view as an error instead of silently returning every record.
    `resolveViewId` moved here from `@object-ui/app-shell` (re-exported there) so
    one matcher serves both the object page and a page component.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-list` — `list-view` maps the binding onto the props
    `ListView` reads. `dataSource.*` keys are authoritative, view-supplied values
    are a baseline the component's own keys override, and `filter` AND-combines at
    every level (the spec calls the binding's filter "additional criteria"), so a
    binding can narrow a saved view but never widen it. A `view` name that does not
    resolve renders a configuration error naming the object's actual views and
    issues no query — it never falls back to the object's default view, because that
    turns a typo into a silently wider answer.

- ab3ad4f: An empty predicate is no longer a declared gate anywhere (objectui#3850, objectui#3862)

  "Is a gate DECLARED on this key — is there a condition to reach a verdict on?" was
  answered three times in this repo, with three different scopes, and the widest
  answers sat on `disabled`, where the mistake is not benign:

  - `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate` (the action face) asked `!= null && !== ''`, so every
    OBJECT counted — including `{ dialect: 'cel', source: '' }`. That envelope is not
    a hand-written curiosity: `@objectstack/spec`'s `ExpressionInputSchema` normalizes
    every authored predicate into one, so "the author left the predicate empty"
    compiles to exactly it. The verdict path normalized the same value back to
    `undefined`, and `evaluateCondition(undefined)` answers `true` — "no condition, so
    visible/enabled". On `visible` that `true` means SHOW, so the two mistakes
    cancelled; on `disabled` it means GREY, so they compounded: a button disabled
    forever that no author asked to disable (objectui#3850, the residue objectui#3842
    left behind).
  - `SchemaRenderer` asked `disabled !== undefined` inline, one notch wider again, so
    `disabled: null` greyed out too — on the GENERIC rendering path, since that block
    runs for every node type, and not as an internal flag either: `_disabled` is
    forwarded to the component as a real `disabled` prop (objectui#3862).
  - `ActionRunner`'s execution gates asked "does this normalize to something
    evaluable?" — the scope that turned out to be right (objectui#3848 / objectui#3872).

  There is now ONE definition, `hasDeclaredPredicate`, exported from
  `@object-ui/core` (`evaluator/declaredPredicate.ts`, beside the `toPredicateInput`
  normalizer it is derived from): a gate is declared when normalization still leaves a
  condition to evaluate. `''`, a whitespace-only string, an empty-`source` envelope
  and any non-predicate value (`0`, `{}`) are NOT declared; `false` IS (a verdict is
  not a missing gate — objectui#3812). `hasDeclaredVisibilityGate` keeps its name as a
  re-export of it, so the five member-action renderer call sites, `DeclaredActionsBar`
  and `record-quick-actions` are unchanged and inherit the scope;
  `SchemaRenderer`'s `disabled` / `disabledOn` chain and `ActionRunner`'s two gates
  read the same function. No consumer got a local "and also check for empty" test —
  that fourth dialect is what objectui#3842 / objectui#3849 spent two PRs merging away.

  Measured behaviour change, `action:button` and the generic path, before → after:

  | value                                                     | `visible`      | `disabled` | `enabled` | `SchemaRenderer` `disabled` prop |
  | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
  | `''`                                                      | shown → shown  | on → on    | on → on   | forwarded → absent               |
  | `null`                                                    | shown → shown  | on → on    | on → on   | forwarded → absent               |
  | `{ dialect: 'cel', source: '' }`                          | shown → shown  | GREY → on  | on → on   | forwarded → absent               |
  | `{ source: '' }`                                          | shown → shown  | GREY → on  | on → on   | forwarded → absent               |
  | `'   '` (whitespace)                                      | HIDDEN → shown | on → on    | GREY → on | forwarded → absent               |
  | `0` / `{}` (not predicates)                               | shown → shown  | GREY → on  | on → on   | forwarded → absent               |
  | `true` / `false` / bare CEL / `${…}` / non-empty envelope | unchanged      | unchanged  | unchanged | unchanged                        |

  Every row moves toward "there is no gate here", never away from it, and no value
  that HAS a verdict changes it — the verdict is still read from the raw value, only
  the gate in front of it narrowed. Two rows are behaviour changes rather than the
  equivalence the ruling expected, and are pinned as such: the whitespace string moves
  on `visible` / `enabled` (it used to normalize to `'${   }'`, which evaluates falsy,
  so a predicate that says nothing HID the action from everyone), and non-predicate
  junk stops greying controls out (fail-open, the posture `ActionRunner` already
  committed to).

  One blank spelling is knowingly still outside the scope: an envelope whose `source`
  is blank but not EMPTY (`{ dialect: 'cel', source: '   ' }`) — the normalizer folds a
  `source` of `''` and does not trim, so the string spelling of a blank predicate is
  trimmed and the envelope spelling is not, and `disabled` still greys out for that one
  value. The ruling enumerated three empty spellings; this is a fourth, measured and
  filed as objectui#3960 rather than widened in here.

  One chain is deliberately untouched: `SchemaRenderer`'s `visible` / `visibleWhen` /
  `visibleOn` / `visibility` / `hidden` / `hiddenOn` legs keep `!== undefined`, because
  narrowing them would change ALIAS PRECEDENCE, not just emptiness. The `hidden` legs
  are not negated and therefore carry this same defect with the polarity that makes the
  node vanish — measured, out of this ruling's scope, filed as objectui#3955.

- c2fd122: fix(actions): forward `bodyShape` end-to-end so a declared body wrap is honoured

  Sibling of the `bodyExtra` fix, same failure shape one key over. `bodyShape` is
  the spec's body-WRAPPING declaration for a `type: 'api'` action — `'flat'` (the
  default) or `{ wrap: key }` to nest the collected params under `key`, the shape
  better-auth's `organization/update` needs. The console `apiHandler` read it
  unconditionally while **no** action renderer forwarded it, so an author who
  declared `bodyShape: { wrap: 'data' }` on an `action:button` / `:group` / `:icon`
  / `:menu` action got a FLAT body on the wire: the endpoint received the params at
  the top level, and the declaration read as honoured because it parsed and
  published.

  The four declared-action renderers now forward the key, and `ActionSchema`
  declares it (typed by derivation from the spec, so the union cannot drift).
  `ActionRunner.executeAPI` — the fallback path taken when no host registered an
  `api` handler — now reads it too, closing a second asymmetry in which the same
  action changed body shape depending on which host executed it. The wrap covers
  the collected params only; `bodyExtra` and other top-level keys stay flat, which
  is the spec's own wording for the key and what both console read-sites already
  did.

  `element:button` deliberately does **not** forward it: its whitelist mirrors
  spec's `InlineActionSchema` pick list field for field, and that pick list does
  not include `bodyShape` — it is not inline vocabulary.

- 1d723e3: fix(core): stop re-wrapping an already-`${…}` predicate, so action-face `visible` / `disabled` finally honour it (objectui#3871)

  `toPredicateInput` — the one normalizer every action surface and the action
  engine share — wrapped **every** string as `${string}`, assuming a bare
  expression. But `${…}` is a spelling this repo documents for a predicate
  (AGENTS.md §4) and one the normalizer's own output type lists as valid, so an
  already-normalized value was wrapped a second time: `'${x}'` became `'${${x}}'`,
  which cannot match the evaluator's single-template fast path and does not parse.
  The author's expression then decided nothing, and which constant came back
  depended on the caller's error policy:

  - **fail-soft** legs (every `disabled` / `enabled` leg; `visible` on
    `action:icon`, `action:group` and the related-list toolbar) got the unparsed
    string back, so `Boolean(…)` was a constant `true`: `disabled: '${…}'` greyed
    the action out permanently, `visible: '${…}'` showed one the author had gated
    away, and `enabled: '${…}'` never disabled anything.
  - **fail-closed** legs (`throwOnError: true` — `visible` on `action:button`,
    `action:bar`, `action:menu`, `DeclaredActionsBar`, and
    `ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation`) got a **throw**, which each site turns
    into "hidden": an action gated with a template predicate was invisible even
    while its gate held, and the fail-closed warning blamed the author's
    expression.

  A string that already carries `${` is now returned untouched (the same guard
  covers the envelope branch, where an unwrapped `source` reaches the identical
  wrap), which makes the normalizer idempotent. Every affected surface goes from a
  constant verdict to the predicate's real one — converging the action face with
  `SchemaRenderer` and `page:header`, which read the raw value and have always
  been right about this spelling (objectui#3314's shape). Bare expressions and
  `{ dialect: 'cel' }` envelopes are untouched.

  `ActionRunner`'s two execution gates already read the raw value and are
  unchanged; the objectui#3871 tripwires they carried have been replaced by pins
  of the now-converged behaviour.

  Whether `${…}` should be _authorable_ on an action predicate at all is a
  separate, spec-side question (`@objectstack/spec`'s `PredicateInput` models a
  bare string and a dialect envelope): if it is to be rejected, that belongs in
  publish-time validation, not in a consumer that silently invents a verdict.

- 0109f54: Blank predicates and non-predicate values are no longer gates, at the last three entries that still judged them (objectui#3955, objectui#3957, objectui#3960)

  objectui#3850 sank "is a predicate gate DECLARED here?" into one definition,
  `@object-ui/core`'s `hasDeclaredPredicate`. Three places were left out of that
  ruling's placement clause, each with the same shape of defect: the evaluator's
  single default for "there is nothing here to evaluate" is `true`, meaning
  _visible/enabled_, and wherever a too-wide "declared" test hands it an empty
  predicate on an INVERTED key, that `true` turns a control off for a value the
  metadata never used to say anything.

  **`SchemaRenderer`'s `hidden` / `hiddenOn` legs (objectui#3955)** asked
  `!== undefined` and did NOT negate the verdict, so an empty predicate meant HIDE
  and the node disappeared — on the generic rendering path, since that block runs
  for every schema type. Harder to diagnose than the `disabled` twin objectui#3862
  fixed: a greyed-out control is still on screen, while a node that never rendered
  is indistinguishable from metadata that meant to hide it. Both legs now read the
  shared definition.

  **The "blank" criterion now covers the envelope spelling (objectui#3960).** The
  definition trimmed a whitespace-only STRING and not an envelope's whitespace-only
  `source`, because `toPredicateInput` folds a `source` of `''` and does not trim.
  So `{ dialect: 'cel', source: '   ' }` was a declared gate whose verdict came from
  core's own CEL entry calling that exact value "no predicate" (`if (!source.trim())
return true`) — `disabled` greyed out forever and `ActionRunner.execute` answered
  `{ success: false, error: 'Action is disabled' }` with the handler never invoked.
  Blankness is now decided once for both spellings, at the definition. The
  NORMALIZER's contract is deliberately unchanged: "what shape does the evaluator
  accept" is not the same question as "is there a condition", and moving the trim
  there would have flipped verdicts for every
  `useCondition(toPredicateInput(…))` call site, including container-level `visible`
  reads that never asked this question at all.

  **`ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation`'s `visible` filter (objectui#3957)** was the
  last consumer answering the question with a range of its own — three empty
  spellings folded by hand, everything else coerced with `Boolean(raw)`. It now reads
  the shared definition and the coercion branch is gone, so one value no longer gets
  two answers depending on whether an action was surfaced by the engine or rendered
  standalone (the invariant objectui#3314 established). Its fail-CLOSED posture on a
  predicate that THROWS is untouched (`throwOnError: true` + `warnHiddenPredicate`):
  "the predicate faulted" and "there is no predicate" are different facts.

  Behaviour changes, before → after. Observation-class: each needs an author to write
  an empty/blank predicate or a non-predicate value, and there is no known user path
  today.

  Every row moves toward "there is no gate here", never away from it, and no value
  that HAS a verdict changes it — a declared `false` is still a verdict, not a
  missing gate (objectui#3812), and blankness is `trim()`, not "short": `{ dialect:
'cel', source: ' x ' }` is a predicate. One alias precedence changes with the
  `hidden` legs and is pinned rather than claimed as an equivalence: an undeclared
  `hidden` no longer short-circuits the chain, so a declared `hiddenOn` is finally
  consulted.

  `SchemaRenderer`'s four `visible*` legs keep `!== undefined` deliberately, as
  objectui#3850 ruled: their `true` is negated, so an empty predicate already lands
  on "shown", and narrowing them would change alias precedence rather than fix
  anything.

- 7e5bb5d: fix(actions): forward `bodyExtra` end-to-end through the action chain

  An action's static request body (`bodyExtra`) was dropped one hop before the
  `ActionRunner`: every action renderer forwards an explicit whitelist of keys, and
  none of them listed `bodyExtra`. Since `@objectstack/spec` 17 made it the only way
  a `type: 'api'` action can carry a payload (`params` keeps its single meaning as
  the parameter definition array), and the ADR-0087
  `inline-action-api-params-to-body-extra` conversion rewrites older object-form
  `params` pages onto it at load, a previously-working published page validated,
  published and then POSTed an empty body.

  `element:button`, `action:button`, `action:group`, `action:icon` and `action:menu`
  now forward the key; `ActionRunner.executeAPI` merges it into the request body
  **last** (so a constant always overrides a same-named user param, matching the
  console `apiHandler`); `ActionSchema` declares it; and a non-array `params` on a
  `type: 'api'` action keeps working for one version window with a dev-mode
  deprecation warning naming `bodyExtra`.

- fbc23e0: Action params that inherit a field's options now keep the keys that field declared

  A field-backed action param (`{ field: 'tier' }`) had its inherited option list
  rebuilt entry by entry as `{ label, value }`, which silently dropped every other
  key the field's options declared — most consequentially the per-option
  `visibleWhen` predicate (ADR-0058). A select field whose options narrow by
  predicate in an object form therefore offered the FULL list in an action dialog,
  including the entries the predicate exists to hide, with no diagnostic on either
  side; `color` / `icon` / `disabled` were lost the same way. Options authored
  inline on the param were never affected — they always passed through verbatim,
  which is the asymmetry this restores.

  The resolver now preserves each inherited entry and only does its two real jobs:
  expanding bare strings into label/value pairs and translating the label through
  `fieldOptionLabel`. The option widgets already filter on `visibleWhen`, so a
  role-gated option (`'admin' in current_user.positions`) inherited by a dialog
  param now narrows the offered set and clears a seeded value the predicate hides.

  `ActionParamDef.options` (`@object-ui/core`) and the resolver's `RawActionParam`
  are widened to match: `ActionParamOption` names the two keys the param layer
  reads and carries the rest of a field's option vocabulary through.

- 6bb454a: `evalRowPredicate`: the fail-closed report now names the engine's failure reason, and the ROW always wins over host scope (objectui#3792, objectui#3796)

  Two defects in one function, `packages/core/src/evaluator/listConditional.ts`,
  shared by every surface that gates on a row predicate: the row kebab, the bulk
  selection bar, kanban conditional formatting, and — since objectui#3521 — the
  record page header.

  **The safest path said the least (objectui#3792).** `evalRowPredicate` has two
  diagnostic routes, and their information content was inverted. The single-eval
  fast route lets the canonical helper warn, so it prints the engine's own reason
  (`Reason: [runtime] No such key: owner_id`). The `warnOnError: true` route — the
  fail-CLOSED one, taken by every caller that makes a button disappear — runs
  `evalFieldPredicate` twice with `{ warn: false }` to tell a fault from a genuine
  `false`, and that silence discarded the reason along with the duplicate warning.
  So the more decisively a surface hid a control, the less it said about why: the
  console line named the predicate but not the defect, and `No such key: owner_id`
  or `no such overload: string == null` is usually the whole answer.

  `FieldPredicateDiagnostic` gains an optional `onFault(reason)` passback:
  `evalFieldPredicate` hands out the engine's verbatim text (kind tag, message and
  source excerpt — the exact string it prints after `Reason:`) even when its own
  warning is suppressed. It fires per fault, deliberately independent of the
  once-per-predicate warning dedupe, so a caller doing its own warn-once
  bookkeeping keeps control of it; the verdict is unaffected, and callers that pass
  nothing are unchanged. `evalRowPredicate` threads that reason into its labelled
  warning, and the legacy-dialect route does the same with the message its engine
  throws (`Reason: [legacy] …`), so both dialect paths report a fault the same way.
  Warn-once semantics are unchanged — the reason is deliberately not part of the
  dedupe key.

  **Wording: not a list function, and not for a long time.** The same message
  called every caller a "**list** conditional predicate". A hidden button on a
  record page header reporting "a list conditional predicate" sends its author to
  the list view to look for a control that was never there. Both messages this
  module emits (evaluation failure and the legacy-dialect deprecation) now read
  "conditional predicate".

  **The row is the subject — on both dialect paths (objectui#3796).** The scope
  merge pinned `data` after the host-scope spread but not `record`, leaving
  `record` to each engine's own binding — and the two engines disagreed. The legacy
  evaluator re-pinned `record` to the row (row won); the CEL engine takes its
  `extra` bag over its `record` binding, so a host scope carrying a `record` key
  won there instead. One function, one predicate text, two subjects — selected by
  whether the string happens to contain `===` or `${…}`, the dialect-routing
  markers, which no author picks deliberately. `record` is now pinned after the
  spread exactly as `data` is, which fixes both paths at the merge site rather than
  relying on either engine's precedence.

  No host injects a `record` key today — `ExpressionProvider` binds
  `current_user` / `user` / `ctx` / `os` / `app` / `data` / `features` — so nothing
  observable changes for existing apps; this closes the edge before a host adds one
  (`ctx.record` already exists, which is exactly how it would arrive). A row FIELD
  named `record` is likewise no longer able to become the row root; it stays
  addressable as `data.record`.

  Shipped as a patch: no new exported symbol, one optional field added to an
  already-exported options interface, and no existing call signature changed.

- 523be48: `object-timeline` and `record:line_items` now apply the filter / sort / row cap they are given, so a named `dataSource.view` narrows them instead of contributing nothing

  These were the two residual gaps in objectstack#7121's per-block coverage table
  (objectstack#7137). Both blocks are object-bound lists, both accepted the spec's
  per-element `dataSource` binding, and neither had a read site for `filter` or
  `sort` anywhere in its fetch:

  - `object-timeline`'s entire query was
    `find(objectName, { options: { $top: 100 } })`.
  - `record:line_items`' was the parent FK plus a fixed `$top: 500`.

  So `dataSource: { object, view: 'hot' }` resolved the view — a typo still reported
  a configuration error, it never degraded into an unfiltered query — and then
  dropped everything the view said. The rendered rows could be **wider than the view
  they named**, silently, which is exactly the class of mistake AI-authored metadata
  hides best: the page looks like it works. objectstack#7121 deliberately left the
  keys unmapped and recorded the gap rather than writing composed values onto schema
  keys nobody read; this closes it at the fetch instead.

  What each block now reads:

  - **`object-timeline`** — `$filter: schema.filter`,
    `$orderby: convertSortToQueryParams(schema.sort)`, and
    `$top: schema.limit ?? 100`, matching the form `object-gantt` / `object-map` /
    `object-calendar` already use. Its registry mapping gains
    `filter` / `sort` / `limit`; `columns` stays unmapped, because a timeline
    projects the fields its `timeline` config names.
  - **`record:line_items`** — the composed filter is **AND-combined** with the parent
    relationship condition through `mergeFilterNodes`, never substituted for it, the
    same way `record:related_list` composes its own since objectstack#7118: a
    line-items panel is always scoped to the record it sits on, so an _additional_
    criterion can only narrow this parent's children and can never surface another
    parent's rows. `sort` becomes the load order and `limit` the row cap (default
    500). `columns` stays unmapped — here they are `GridColumn[]` driving an editable
    grid, not a field-name projection, so a view's column list would be the wrong
    _shape_ rather than merely a wider answer.

  **Behaviour change worth knowing about:** the timeline's default window is now a
  real cap. `{ options: { $top: 100 } }` nested the limit under a key that is not a
  `QueryParams` field and that no adapter in this repo reads (`convertQueryParams`
  maps `params.$top`), so the intended window never reached the wire and a timeline
  over a large object fetched whatever the server chose to return. It is now sent as
  `$top`, and authorable via `limit` or a view's `pagination.pageSize`.

  `@object-ui/core` gains `convertSortToQueryParams`, the sort→`$orderby` lowering
  the three sibling blocks each inline privately. It is shared rather than copied
  twice more, and is slightly more faithful to the declared contract than those
  copies: a sort entry that omits `order` means ascending instead of being dropped
  (the string spelling `"amount"` already meant ascending in the same copies), and
  nothing orderable yields `undefined` rather than a truthy empty `{}`. Migrating
  the three existing copies onto it is objectstack#7148 and is not done here.

### Minor Changes

- 5781fb1: `@object-ui/core` now ships the server-action dispatcher factory —
  `createServerActionHandler({ fetch, baseUrl, resolveObject, ... })` — so any
  consumer of the runner (standalone renderers, SDUI hosts, embedded usage) can
  run `action.body` script actions by registering the produced handler, instead
  of dead-ending on the built-in `executeScript`'s "must be executed server-side"
  error with no supported way to make it run (objectui#2904, the follow-up
  objectui#2896 deferred).

  The factory is deliberately opinion-free about the three things core has no
  business deciding — auth (`fetch` is an injected authenticated wrapper), origin
  (`baseUrl` string or thunk; no bundler env convention), and fallback object
  scope (`resolveObject`) — and owns everything protocol-shaped, once:

  - name-based action identity (ADR-0110 D1 — `target` is a binding expression,
    never an identity);
  - the record-id resolution dance, also exported as
    `resolveServerActionRecordId` (`_rowRecord`, `recordIdField`, toolbar
    selection fallback with its single/zero-select guards, aggregate
    `_selectedIds` bypass), replaceable wholesale via `resolveRecordId` for
    hosts with their own policy (record pages);
  - a re-entrancy guard per action+record;
  - the `/actions` response-envelope rule: `interpretActionResponse`,
    `readActionPayload` and `actionErrorDetail` moved from `@object-ui/app-shell`
    internals into core and are now public exports.

  `@object-ui/app-shell`'s two hand-rolled copies of this POST —
  `useConsoleActionRuntime.serverActionHandler` and `RecordDetailView`'s — are
  collapsed into one console wrapper (`createConsoleServerActionHandler`) that
  layers the browser-only choreography (popup pre-open dance, zero-roundtrip
  `newTabUrl` fast path, `redirectUrl` convention) over the core factory. The
  copies had already drifted twice (objectstack#3913 — envelope; framework#3935 —
  identity, fixed in one copy only): RecordDetailView now also dispatches by
  declarative `name` instead of `target || name`, and no longer leaks the
  client-side `_rowRecord` stash to the server.

- f833d3a: Retire `validation` from the action-param contract — it was declared on both
  halves, read by neither, and rejected outright by the server (objectui#3201).

  FROM: `validation?: string` was declared on the AUTHORING type
  (`@object-ui/types`' `ActionParam`) and on the RESOLVED type (`@object-ui/core`'s
  `ActionParamDef`). TO: it is declared on neither.

  **Breaking for anyone who declared it — but it never did anything.** This is
  marked `minor`, not `major`, per the repo's version-alignment policy (objectui's
  major tracks `@objectstack`'s, so objectui's own breaking changes ship as `minor`
  with the breaking semantics spelled out here).

  **Migration: delete it.** If you authored `validation: '...'` on an action param,
  it never took effect, and publishing that metadata to the server is a hard parse
  failure — so any metadata that reached production either never carried the key or
  never parsed. Removing it changes no runtime behaviour; it only moves the error
  from "silent no-op, then rejected at publish" to a `tsc` error at the keystroke.

  Why it could not work as authored:

  - `ActionParamSchema` in `@objectstack/spec/ui` is `.strict()` and does not list
    `validation`, so an authored key is a PARSE REJECTION on the server:
    `Unrecognized key(s) on this action param: \`validation\``. Meanwhile `tsc`
    against the public type accepted it — the type vouched for a key the platform
    itself refuses.
  - Nothing read it on the resolved side either: it was never a key of
    `resolveActionParams()`'s `RawActionParam`, the runtime field metadata a
    field-backed param inherits from carries no `validation` to source one from,
    and `paramToField()` never mapped it — so it could not reach the field widgets,
    whose rules `buildValidationRules()` builds from `required` / `minLength` /
    `maxLength` / `pattern`.

  Removed rather than implemented, on ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove. Giving it meaning
  would mean first deciding what an "expression" is here (CEL? a formula? a regex?)
  and adding it to `@objectstack/spec`, which is where such a capability has to
  start — not accreted renderer-side around a key the contract does not have.

  This also retires the last named exception in objectui#3174's drift guard
  (`packages/types/src/__tests__/page-nav-misc-spec-parity.test.ts`), which carried
  `validation` as the one key `ActionParam` added on top of the spec's set. The
  rule it pins — **the authoring type declares exactly the spec's authorable
  keys** — is now literal: the guard asserts the local-only key set is empty, so
  any future addition fails the build instead of being waved through.

- d22ae31: Track `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0-rc.2 (objectui#3235, #3208, #3287, #3264).

  The pin moves from `^17.0.0-rc.1` to `^17.0.0-rc.2` across the workspace, and
  the sibling `@objectstack/*` packages (`client` / `core` / `formula` / `lint`)
  move with it — they pin `@objectstack/spec` **exactly**, so leaving them behind
  kept a second copy of the spec in the tree and would have had `@objectstack/lint`
  validating against rc.1 schemas that still accept keys rc.2 retires.

  Breaking semantics, in FROM → TO form:

  - **`app.homePageId` is retired — an app's landing page is now its first
    navigation item.** An app that pinned a landing page with `homePageId` will
    open on the first reachable navigation entry (by `order`) instead; the root
    landing still follows `isDefault`. To restore a specific landing page, reorder
    `navigation` so the intended entry comes first. Stored metadata is migrated by
    `os migrate meta --from 16`. The key is a hard error now, not a stripped one:
    the spec ships a tombstone that names the migration.
    Upstream retired it because of its SHAPE, not its usage — it was an ID
    cross-reference with no referential integrity, so a `homePageId` that pointed
    at nothing silently fell back to the first navigation item anyway
    (objectstack#4667, premise corrected in #4709). If the capability returns, it
    returns as a flag on the navigation item itself, which cannot dangle.
  - **`@object-ui/types`' `HttpMethod` now resolves to the spec's
    `HttpMethodType`.** Shape is verbatim identical — the same 5-value UI subset —
    and `@object-ui/types` still exports it as `HttpMethod`, so no consumer
    changes. The spec renamed its `./ui` export because `HttpMethod` named two
    different types depending on the import path (`./shared` / `./api` carry a
    7-value enum including `HEAD` / `OPTIONS`); objectui deliberately keeps the
    5-value one (objectstack#4691).
  - **`AppContextSelector.includeAll` / `placement` are gone.** Neither ever did
    anything in this renderer: context selectors are mandatory-scope, so no "All"
    row was ever rendered, and `placement: 'topbar'` put nothing in the topbar.
    Both carried schema defaults, which is why the liveness lint structurally
    could not flag them — removal was the only channel that reaches an author
    (framework#4509).
  - **`NavigationArea.visible` / `order` / `requiredPermissions` are gone.** An
    area is a layout grouping, not an access boundary. Gating moved down to the
    navigation ITEM, where `visible` and `requiredPermissions` are unchanged and
    still enforced. `AppSchemaRenderer`'s area switcher no longer hides an area, so
    an area whose items are all gated away renders as visible-but-empty rather
    than disappearing.
  - **`@object-ui/core` no longer exports `NotificationProtocol`**
    (`resolveNotificationConfig`, `specNotificationToToast`, `mapSeverityToVariant`,
    `mapPosition`, `ToastNotification`). It bridged `@objectstack/spec/ui`'s
    `Notification` / `NotificationConfig`, which objectstack#4610 deleted with no
    successor. Use `resolveNotificationConfig` from `@object-ui/react`
    (`NotificationContext`), which owns the live `NotificationSystemConfig` and is
    what every notification surface already read. Note that the spec's _other_
    `Notification` — `@objectstack/spec/api` — is the REST inbox row, a different
    contract, and is deliberately NOT aliased in as a replacement.
  - **The `email_template` client-side validator now uses
    `EmailTemplateDefinitionSchema`.** It was pointing at the removed
    `EmailTemplateSchema`, so authored templates were being checked against the
    wrong contract: the live one is keyed `name` + `locale` (not `id`) and splits
    the body into `bodyHtml` / `bodyText` (not `body` + `bodyType`)
    (objectstack#4616 / #4807).

  Fixes that are not breaking, but were only found because rc.2 stopped being
  lenient — each had been passing vacuously:

  - **`view` drafts are actually validated now.** The client validator named the
    aggregated container schema while this admin authors first-class `ViewItem`s,
    and the container used to strip `viewKind` / `config` in silence — so no view
    draft ever had one of its own keys checked. It now validates each shape
    against its own schema (objectui#3312).
  - **The console's worked examples were wrong**, and being stripped rather than
    refused: `view.list.object` (the container root already declares it),
    `job.concurrency` / `job.timeoutMs` (no such keys; the spelling is `timeout`,
    already in ms), `email_template.from` / `.to` (a template is not a send —
    the sender override is `fromOverride`, an object), and
    `datasource.capabilities` / `.healthCheck` (objectstack#4583 removed the
    former; the latter was never a datasource key). These are the drafts an
    author — or a model generating metadata — copies.
  - Action key inventory re-derived: `ActionSchema` gained the package-lock
    envelope (`_lock*` / `_package*` / `_provenance`), so a packaged action no
    longer reports them as unknown keys.
  - The schema-diff panel labels the new `default_mismatch` finding.
  - Test fixtures pinning the retired `managedBy: 'system'` bucket now use
    `engine-owned`. Protocol 17 split that value (objectstack#3355), so it
    resolved to the default-writable fallback and a batch of "stays locked"
    assertions had quietly stopped asserting anything.

### Patch Changes

- 18cd432: `ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation` now evaluates a `{ dialect: 'cel', source }` action `visible` predicate on the canonical `@objectstack/formula` engine instead of the legacy JS evaluator. The method used to unwrap the envelope into a `${source}` string before calling `evaluateCondition`, which only routes to the CEL engine while its argument is still an envelope — so the engine silently demoted every CEL predicate to the legacy path while every action renderer (`action-button`, `action-menu`, `action-bar`, … via `toPredicateInput`) ran the same predicate on CEL (#2661). Because `ExpressionInputSchema` normalizes even a bare authored string into a CEL envelope, that was the common case, and the two engines disagree: `null < null` faults in CEL (fail-closed hide) but is `false` in JS, and CEL-only builtins such as `today()` do not exist on the JS path at all — so one `visible:` predicate could hide a button in the renderer while the engine kept it (or the reverse). Normalization now goes through a shared `toPredicateInput` helper exported from `@object-ui/core`, pinned to the renderer-side twin by a parity suite. Bare strings, non-`cel` dialects, empty `source`, and boolean predicates all behave exactly as before (#3314).
- d915c47: Relation fields (`lookup` / `master_detail` / `user` / `tree`) are now usable in action and conditional-formatting predicates: they bind as the stored foreign key on every surface, and the fields a predicate reads are included in the query projection (#3501).

  Before this, one predicate over one relation field had four different fates, decided by things its author does not control. `$expand` **replaces** the id in place with the whole related record, and a view expands exactly the relations it shows as COLUMNS — so `record.owner == "U1"` was **true** where the column was absent, **false** where it was displayed, and a **fault** where the field was neither displayed nor projected (a list's `$select` was built from its columns alone, and CEL treats an absent key as a fault, not as null). A fault is fail-CLOSED on the row kebab and the selection bar and fail-OPEN on the lenient paths, so the same authoring mistake hid the button from everyone on one surface and showed it to everyone on the next, with nothing on screen to point at either. The server, meanwhile, only ever sees the id — so client and server could not agree, which is the one thing ADR-0036 / ADR-0058 exist to guarantee.

  Two changes close it. `toPredicateRecord` (new, `@object-ui/core`) collapses expanded relation values back to their ids when a record is bound for evaluation — driven by the object's own field types, not by sniffing for an `id` key, so a `json` field that happens to carry one is untouched. It is threaded through `evalRowPredicate` / `resolveConditionalFormatting` (via a new `fields` option), `useRowPredicate`, `partitionBulkRows`, and both `page:header` evaluators, with the object schema supplied by `ObjectGrid` / `ListView` / `ObjectKanban` / the record context. Kanban card formatting is threaded the same way, so a rule cannot match on the grid view of a list and silently never match on its board. Display is unaffected — a detail-page title still renders the related record's name, and the schema-only `kanban-ui` entry point (which has no object schema to offer) keeps using the payload verbatim. `collectPredicateFieldRefs` / `listViewPredicates` (new) harvest the `record.x` / `data.x` references out of a view's conditional formatting, row-action defs, bulk-action defs, promoted object actions and `userActions` overrides, and add them to `$select` — intersected with the object's declared fields plus the platform columns every object carries (`isProjectableField`), because an unknown key is not ignored by every backend. No `$expand` is added: a predicate wants the foreign key, which is what an unexpanded relation already is.

- 509104a: Fix matrix report cells showing another bucket's numbers when dimension values run together.

  The cross-tab in `DatasetReportRenderer` built its bucket ids by joining dimension values with the EMPTY string, so adjacent values had no boundary at all: `"x"` + `"yz"` and `"xy"` + `"z"` were the same bucket on both axes, and the later row silently overwrote the earlier one. Its cell key then joined the two bucket ids with a plain space, while dimension values contain spaces constantly ("New York", "In Progress"), so `"New"` × `"York Q1"` and `"New York"` × `"Q1"` also met in one key. A merged bucket showed a different row's measure, the overwritten row's value was unreachable, the per-row and per-column subtotals matched the wrong header, and drill-through followed the same wrong index into another record's list — none of it with an error.

  Bucket ids and cell keys are now encoded with `JSON.stringify`, which carries the boundary in its own quoting rather than in a character the data is assumed never to contain. All four lookups in the renderer (row headers, column headers, row subtotals, column subtotals) share the one encoder, so they agree by construction.

  The encoders moved to `@object-ui/core` as `pivotBucketId` / `pivotCellKey` and are now shared with the dashboard `DatasetWidget`, which carried the same defect and fixed it separately: two packages each hand-rolling the same key is why one fix left the other broken. The dashboard keeps its existing exports and behaviour.

- a4cff5b: Conditional-rule predicates that fail to evaluate are no longer silent
  (objectstack#5149, appeal 2). `evalFieldPredicate` — the canonical funnel for
  `visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen`, view-level `visibleOn`, legacy
  `condition`, per-option `visibleWhen`, screen-field predicates and list
  conditional formatting — now logs **one `console.warn` per predicate text**
  when evaluation fails (parse error, unbound identifier, engine fault), carrying
  the predicate source, the engine's failure reason, and the field/rule locator
  the call site provides. Renderer call sites thread that locator
  (`visibleWhen of field 'amount'`), so a broken predicate identifies itself in
  the browser console instead of being indistinguishable from an absent one.

  Verdicts are unchanged: evaluation still fails open to the caller's safe
  default (flipping that default is objectstack#5149 appeal 1, tracked
  separately). Fault-probing callers (`evalRowPredicate`'s fail-closed path,
  `ExpressionEvaluator`'s `throwOnError`) opt out via the new
  `diagnostic.warn: false` and keep their own single diagnostic, so no broken
  predicate ever warns twice.

- 2a9513d: `toFilterNode` now lowers a spec `ViewFilterRule[]` into ObjectQL AST nodes instead of returning the array verbatim, so a saved view's stored filter reaches `$filter` as something the server accepts. It previously did not: `ListViewSchema.filter` / `ViewTab.filter` are declared `z.array(ViewFilterRuleSchema)`, and the whole read path — `ObjectView` → `ListViewSchema.filter` → `buildEffectiveFilter` → `mergeFilterNodes` → `toFilterNode` — carried those rule objects untouched into the query. `isFilterAST` is `false` for an array of objects, so the data API answered `400 INVALID_FILTER` and the list rendered no rows at all. Measured against a real backend on the showcase's shipped `showcase_task.in_progress` view: `$filter=[{"field":"status","operator":"equals","value":"in_progress"}]` returned `400`, while the lowered `[["status","equals","in_progress"]]` returned its 2 rows. Every saved view carrying a filter was affected, on both producers that share this sink — `plugin-list`'s `buildEffectiveFilter` (the grid and its export) and `plugin-view`'s `ObjectView` (calendar / kanban / gallery / timeline).

  Operators are canonicalised through the spec's own `normalizeFilterOperator`, the same exit the write side (`viewFilterFold`) uses, so the two directions cannot drift into two dialects; no second operator table is introduced. An operator the spec does not know is passed through verbatim so the server still refuses it loudly rather than having a misspelling coerced into a valid filter. AST nodes and MongoDB-style object filters are unaffected, mixed arrays (a view's rules concatenated with `?filter[<field>]=<value>` URL triples) fold element-wise with the triples untouched, and a rule with a blank `field` is deliberately left unlowered — `["", op, value]` passes `isFilterAST` and returns an empty list, whereas the unlowered rule keeps the loud `400`.

### Minor Changes

- bca45cc: Declare the 18 spec-owned action keys `ActionDef` had been absorbing silently.

  `ActionDef` ends with `[key: string]: any`, so it accepted any key of any type —
  a typo (`targt`) and a retired spec key (`execute`) both type-checked, then the
  runner silently bound no handler (the #2169 "Mark Done does nothing" shape).
  Step 1 (objectstack#4075) made that audible with a dev-mode warning. This is
  step 2: the keys the warning identified as legitimate are now real fields.

  - **18 keys promoted to explicit optional fields** — `ai`, `aria`, `bodyExtra`,
    `bodyShape`, `bulkEnabled`, `component`, `icon`, `locations`, `mode`,
    `objectName`, `order`, `recordIdField`, `recordIdParam`, `requiredPermissions`,
    `requiresFeature`, `shortcut`, `variant`, `visible`. Every type is **derived**
    from `@objectstack/spec`'s `ActionInput` (`SpecActionInput['locations']`, …),
    never hand-copied: a hand-written duplicate of a spec shape is a second
    contract that drifts, which is the failure this issue is about. Wrong-typed
    values are now compile errors — `order: 'first'`, `variant: 'chartreuse'`,
    `locations: ['nope']` — where before they were absorbed silently.
  - **Derived from `z.input`, not `z.infer`.** `ActionSchema` is a `ZodPipe` whose
    transform narrows `visible` from `string | { dialect, source }` to the
    envelope alone. This runner consumes authored/stored rows, which are
    rehydrated unparsed, so it sees the input shape; deriving from the inferred
    `Action` would have rejected the raw-string predicate `ActionEngine`
    explicitly supports.
  - **Three `as any` casts deleted** in `ActionEngine` — `visible` and
    `requiredPermissions` at the location filter, `locations` at registration.
    They existed only because the fields were undeclared.
  - **Four objectui-dialect keys marked `@deprecated`** with the spec spelling to
    use instead — `actionType` (→ `type`), `api` and `endpoint` (→ `target`;
    `executeAPI` already resolves `api || endpoint || target`), and `navigate`
    (→ flat `target` / `openIn`). Only these four: the remaining dialect keys are
    runner mechanics (chaining, toasts, post-execution reload/close) with no spec
    counterpart, and pointing them at a spelling that does not exist would be
    worse than leaving them declared.

  **Breaking edge, deliberate.** `shortcut` and `bulkEnabled` were retired by
  `@objectstack/spec` 17 as `retiredKey()` tombstones (`z.never()`), so authoring
  either is already a hard parse rejection. Deriving their types rather than
  hand-writing them turns that runtime rejection into a **compile error**: code
  that assigned `shortcut: 'ctrl+k'` to an `ActionDef` compiled before and does
  not now. Such metadata was already refused by the platform — this only moves the
  failure to where it can be fixed. A host may still pass either explicitly via
  `ActionEngine.registerAction(action, { shortcut, bulkEnabled })`; only authored
  metadata stopped carrying them. `bulkEnabled`'s replacement is the list view's
  `bulkActions` / `bulkActionDefs`; `shortcut` has none.

  The index signature **stays** — removing it is step 3, and the inverted pin
  asserting it is still present remains the issue's own completion check.

- 4bf612c: Aggregate single-call mode for bulk actions: `execution: 'aggregate'` (objectui#3139).

  A `bulkActionDefs` entry with `operation: 'custom'` used to have exactly one
  dispatch shape: one action-runner call per selected record (`_rowRecord`
  attached). "Select N rows → ONE call that receives every selected id" — the
  zip-of-QR-codes / merged-PDF / batch-print shape — could not be expressed, so
  downstream projects fell back to per-row `window.open` storms or gave up.

  `BulkActionDef` now carries `execution?: 'perRecord' | 'aggregate'` (default
  `'perRecord'`, existing views untouched). An aggregate def dispatches its
  action exactly once for the whole selection with `params._selectedIds:
string[]` injected and the full records published as
  `context.selectedRecords`. The authored form usually just names a declared
  object action — `{ name, operation: 'custom', execution: 'aggregate' }` —
  and `resolveBulkActions` attaches the declaration. Results are
  all-or-nothing: a failure is attributed to every id with the real error and
  per-row Retry is hidden (re-running the action is the retry; a total failure
  keeps the selection). `batchSize` does not apply; `maxRecords` still gates.

  The executor rides the existing `executeBulkBatch` bulk-first decision tree —
  the aggregate call is its `bulkCall`, and the per-row "fallback" only
  re-throws the captured error for attribution, never fans out N dispatches
  against an endpoint written for one `_selectedIds` call.

  Also: url/api target interpolation now exposes `${ctx.selection.ids}` (comma
  -joined) and `${ctx.selection.count}` from the grid's checkbox selection, so
  a plain `list_toolbar` action can carry the selection without bulk plumbing;
  the console's server-action handler recognizes `_selectedIds` and skips the
  single-record multi-select guard for aggregate dispatches.

- 335041c: Stop declaring 13 `@object-ui/core` symbols under names `@objectstack/spec` owns
  (objectui#3158, objectstack#4115 batch 4).

  **Breaking for importers of `@object-ui/core`** — seven exported names changed,
  because the spec exports the same name for a _different_ thing:

  | was                      | now                               | what the spec's same-named export actually is                                |
  | :----------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `ChartSeries`            | `ChartSeriesBinding`              | the authored dataset-binding descriptor (a measure `name`, no `data`)        |
  | `ActionHandler`          | `ActionRunnerHandler`             | the SERVER-side objectql handler, `(ctx) => unknown`                         |
  | `PluginDefinition`       | `RegistryPluginDefinition`        | the platform PACKAGE manifest (`id`/`slug`/`staticPath`/install hooks)       |
  | `ValidationError`        | `SchemaNodeValidationError`       | plugin-manifest validation, keyed by `field`, no severity                    |
  | `ValidationResult`       | `SchemaNodeValidationResult`      | ditto, with both arrays optional                                             |
  | `defineView`             | `defineSystemView`                | the VIEW-DOCUMENT factory: parses a `ViewSchema`, returns a validated `View` |
  | `resolveCrudAffordances` | `resolveEffectiveCrudAffordances` | the object-level affordance matrix, with no notion of server API operations  |

  The other six keep their names and are now **imported from the spec** instead of
  re-declared: `StyleMap`, `ResponsiveStyles` (ADR-0065), `RowHeight`,
  `CONTEXT_TOKENS`, `CrudAffordances`, `RowCrudPredicates`.

  **The copies were live misdescriptions, not just duplicates.** Three said so in
  their own comments:

  - `CONTEXT_TOKENS` carried a note that the duplication was "temporary until the
    next coordinated release… because the installed `@objectstack/spec` predates
    that export". The installed spec (17.0.0-rc.0) exports it, and the copy was
    byte-identical — so it passed every value comparison and every behavioural
    test for the whole interval in which its stated reason was false.
  - `RowHeight` advertised itself as "the spec's `RowHeightSchema` vocabulary"
    while being a hand-written union. It happened to be correct; nothing would
    have caught the day it stopped being.
  - `managedBy.ts` described itself as a "UI-side mirror of the framework's
    `resolveCrudAffordances()`" and carried its own `DEFAULTS` table — a
    line-for-line copy of the spec's `CRUD_AFFORDANCE_DEFAULTS`, plus a copy of
    its override parser.

  `resolveEffectiveCrudAffordances` now **delegates** the bucket/`userActions` half
  to the spec's `resolveCrudAffordances()`, so the bucket table has exactly one
  definition on the platform. What stays objectui's is the part the spec has no
  notion of: intersecting that matrix with the server-resolved effective API
  operation set (#3391), so the UI never offers a button the server would 405 —
  and the name now says that instead of claiming to be the spec's function.

  Deriving `RowCrudPredicates` also **tightens** it: the local copy typed
  `visibleWhen`/`disabledWhen` as `unknown`, where the spec types them as
  `Expression | ExpressionInput`. That was imprecision, not a deliberate dialect.

- b414983: fix(dashboard): a date globalFilter's preset-name default becomes a range, not an equality

  Setup → System Overview rendered EVERY KPI tile as 0 while its period selector
  read "All time" (objectstack#4475). Every request was `200 OK`, the widgets
  rendered normally, and nothing in the UI signalled a failure — zeros read as
  "nothing has happened yet" rather than as an error, which is why this survived
  to an RC.

  Both symptoms are one missing normalization. `resolveDashboardFilterDefs` lifts
  the built-in `dateRange` declaration's preset NAME to `{ preset }`, but passed a
  `globalFilters` entry's `defaultValue` through raw. `@objectstack/spec`'s
  `GlobalFilterSchema.defaultValue` is `string | number | boolean`, so a bare
  preset name is the ONLY spelling an author can write — and nothing ever mapped
  it. System Overview declares
  `{ field: 'created_at', type: 'date', defaultValue: 'last_7_days' }`, so:

  - `buildFilterCondition` fell through to its "a bare string date means equality
    on that day" branch and the widget sent
    `runtimeFilter: { created_at: 'last_7_days' }`. The backend compiled
    `SELECT COUNT(*) AS "user_count" FROM "sys_user" WHERE created_at = $1`
    — verified against a live server, byte-for-byte the SQL in the issue. The
    actual `sys_user` count is 4; that equality matches no row.
  - `DateRangeFilter` derives its selected item from `value.preset` / `.from` /
    `.to`, all `undefined` on a bare string, so the control fell through to its
    ALL sentinel and displayed "All time" while sending that equality. The tiles
    therefore looked deliberately unfiltered and merely empty.

  `normalizeDateDefault` now applies the same lift the sibling `dateRange`
  declaration already receives, for `date`/`dateRange` filters whose default names
  a preset this module actually knows. This is not consumer-side leniency: it is
  one normalization function completing the same conversion for the sibling
  declaration, and the spec admits no other spelling for an author to fix at the
  producer. A genuine ISO date string still means equality on that day (the
  documented behaviour), and numbers, booleans and unrecognised strings are left
  exactly as declared.

  No backend change is needed: given a real range the dataset path already lowers
  it correctly (`WHERE (created_at >= $1 AND created_at < $2)` → 4). The
  framework's dashboard metadata needs none either — it is spec-compliant as
  written, and editing it would only hide the defect.

  Levelled `minor` rather than `patch` because the change is visible in rendered
  dashboards rather than internal: any dashboard declaring a date-typed
  `globalFilters` default now emits a different query shape, its numbers change
  (from 0 to real values), and its filter control's displayed label changes with
  them. Anything asserting on the previously-emitted condition will see it move.

  Known residual, filed separately rather than widened into here: a `date` filter
  whose value is neither a known preset nor a parseable ISO date still degrades
  silently to an equality that matches nothing, producing the same
  healthy-looking zero. Preset names are covered by this change; a misspelled
  custom value is not.

- 256f8cc: fix(dashboard): an unrecognised date filter value is skipped and named, not compared

  The residual the preset-name fix (objectui#3150 / objectstack#4475) left behind,
  and the more deceptive half of it: a `date`/`dateRange` filter value that is
  neither a known preset name nor a parseable date used to fall through to the
  "a bare string date means equality on that day" branch. A misspelled default —
  `defaultValue: 'last_7_dayz'` — therefore reached the widget query as
  `runtimeFilter: { created_at: 'last_7_dayz' }`, which the backend faithfully
  compiled to `WHERE created_at = $1`. `200 OK`, widget renders, count is 0 —
  indistinguishable from "this range genuinely has no data". No 4xx, no console
  warning, no UI signal. objectstack#4475 took a full RC cycle to catch for
  exactly this reason: **0 looks like a legitimate answer**.

  `buildFilterCondition` now holds a date value to three spellings, and only
  three:

  1. a known preset name → range bounds (unchanged, objectui#3150);
  2. an ISO date (`2026-01-15`, `2026-01-15T08:30:00Z`) or a date-macro token
     (`{today}`, `{7_days_ago}`) → equality on that day (the documented
     behaviour, unchanged);
  3. **anything else → the filter is skipped and `console.warn` names the filter,
     the offending value, and the accepted spellings.**

  The `{ preset: '<unknown>' }` object form gets the same voice. It already
  dropped the filter — silently — because the preset lookup missed and no
  `from`/`to` remained; that drop is now announced. When explicit bounds ride
  along with an unknown preset the bounds are still honoured, and the warning says
  which of the two won.

  Rule 3 is deliberately the same strictness `buildWidgetScopedFilter` already
  applies to a _default binding on a field the object does not have_ — skip and
  warn, with the same rationale spelled out there: never emit a query the backend
  can only empty-match. Field _names_ had that guard; field _values_ did not.

  The macro-token check asks `resolveDateMacros` itself whether it recognises the
  string, rather than restating its token grammar in a second place. One
  vocabulary, no dialect to drift — and a token that resolver does not know
  (`{last_7_dayz}`) is precisely the typo this guard exists to catch.

  Levelled `minor`, matching objectui#3150, because the emitted query shape
  changes: a dashboard carrying a misspelled date value stops sending a
  never-matching equality and instead sends no constraint for that filter (its
  numbers go from 0 to unfiltered) while the console says why. Anything asserting
  on the previously-emitted equality will see it disappear.

  Note the direction of the relaxation is chosen, not incidental: skipping widens
  the result set, so the number visibly changes and the warning explains it —
  whereas the old behaviour narrowed it to zero, which is the one outcome an
  author cannot tell from a correct answer. Author-time rejection (validating
  `GlobalFilterSchema.defaultValue` at publish, in `@objectstack/spec`) is the
  stricter complement and belongs on the platform side; it is filed separately.

- d3584c6: Bring the whole `@objectstack` family to `17.0.0-rc.1`, so the dependency graph resolves a
  single copy of `@objectstack/spec`.

  #3178 bumped **only** `@objectstack/spec` to `17.0.0-rc.1`. The rest of the family —
  `client`, `core`, `formula`, `lint` (and `sdui-parser`, reached through `lint`) — stayed on
  `17.0.0-rc.0`, and each of them depends on spec at an **exact** version rather than a
  caret:

  ```
  @objectstack/client@17.0.0-rc.0  -> spec "17.0.0-rc.0"
  @objectstack/core@17.0.0-rc.0    -> spec "17.0.0-rc.0"
  @objectstack/formula@17.0.0-rc.0 -> spec "17.0.0-rc.0"
  @objectstack/lint@17.0.0-rc.0    -> spec "17.0.0-rc.0"
  ```

  So `main` carried **two** spec copies: objectui's own code read `17.0.0-rc.1` while every
  `@objectstack/*` package read `17.0.0-rc.0` from its own nested `node_modules`. That breaks
  the single-contract invariant this repo's guards are built on, and it breaks them
  _silently_ — the affected checks depend on identity, not on version strings:

  - `spec-subschema-parity.test.ts` distinguishes a genuine re-export from a fork by
    **reference identity** of the zod schema object. Two spec copies make every schema a
    distinct object, so a real re-export starts reading as a fork (or a fork slips through,
    depending on which copy each side resolved).
  - `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs` and `spec-symbol-parity.test.ts` use
    `createRequire` to resolve spec's `.d.ts` and run it through the TS checker. With two
    copies installed, _which_ declaration file the checker sees is a function of resolution
    order rather than of intent.

  The declared ranges were already `^17.0.0-rc.0`, which technically admits rc.1 — the pin
  lived in the lockfile. Raising the remaining ranges to `^17.0.0-rc.1` makes the floor
  explicit and forbids a future install from silently sliding back onto a family member that
  drags rc.0 along with it. The rc.1 family members pin spec at `17.0.0-rc.1` exactly, so the
  graph now converges on one copy by construction, not by luck.

  No product behaviour changes here. `check:spec-symbols` reconciliation was already
  completed by #3178 and stays green under the unified graph; this changeset is `minor`
  per the repo's fixed-group version policy.

- 444457c: feat!: follow the framework's `managedBy: 'system'` → `'system-data'` retirement (objectstack#3355)

  **FROM → TO: `managedBy: 'system'` → `managedBy: 'system-data'`.** The framework
  retired the residual `system` bucket in protocol 17; this is the UI half of that
  change, landing with it so the closed `ManagedByBucket` union stays a mirror
  rather than a fork.

  ADR-0103 split the overloaded `system` bucket additively in v16 — the
  engine-owned objects moved to the explicit `engine-owned`, the admin/user-writable
  ones stayed on `system` — which left that value named after the half that had
  already moved out. `system-data` names what it actually holds: the SCHEMA is the
  platform's, the DATA is the admin's or the user's.

  **The derivation this deletes is the point.** Because v16's `system` doubled as
  both the engine-owned default and the writable set, three UI surfaces had to
  RECOVER the distinction from `userActions` at render time:

  - `isSystemWritable()` probed `userActions` for any opted-in write. It is now
    `managedBy === 'system-data'` — the bucket answers directly.
  - `ManagedByBadge` derived a synthetic `'system-writable'` variant key. The
    variant map is now 1:1 with the bucket union, so a new bucket is a compile
    error to miss instead of a silent fallthrough. The `systemWritable` /
    `system` i18n keys are **unchanged**, so no locale bundle moves.
  - `resolveManagedByEmptyState()` asked the resolved `create` affordance whether a
    `system` list should read "entries appear automatically" or show the New
    button. `system-data` now falls through to the generic empty state by
    definition; `engine-owned` keeps the automatic-entries copy.

  **Breaking (UI API):** `ManagedByBadge`'s `userActions` prop and the exported
  `ManagedByUserActions` interface are **removed**. The bucket alone selects the
  variant now, so the prop had become metadata nothing read — the exact defect the
  framework change exists to remove; shipping it as an accepted-but-ignored prop
  would have reproduced it one layer up. Drop the prop from call sites; no other
  change is needed.

  `MANAGED_BY_BUCKETS` and `ManagedByBucket` no longer contain `'system'`.

- 850033c: Stop offering the retired `action.shortcut` / `action.bulkEnabled` keys.

  `@objectstack/spec` 17 retired both as `retiredKey()` tombstones: authoring
  either one is a hard PARSE REJECTION, so a draft carrying it cannot be saved
  at all. The designer still offered controls for both — a "Bulk — apply to
  multiple selected rows" checkbox and a "Shortcut" text field — which meant the
  Studio action inspector let an author build a draft the platform would then
  refuse, with the rejection arriving later and nowhere near the checkbox.

  - **Action inspector**: both controls removed. The keys stay hidden from the
    fallback form (the server's live schema still advertises them, so dropping
    them from the hidden list would put the inputs straight back) — now under a
    `RETIRED_FIELDS` list that says why, so nobody "restores the missing
    control". `bulkEnabled`'s replacement is the list view's `bulkActions` /
    `bulkActionDefs`; `shortcut` has none.
  - **Action preview**: the `shortcut` and `bulk` pills are gone — they could
    only ever render for metadata the platform now refuses.
  - **`ActionEngine.registerActions`**: no longer harvests the two retired keys
    from authored metadata, which made two dead registration options look
    load-bearing. Both are still accepted on the single-action
    `registerAction(action, options)` overload, where a HOST passes them
    explicitly.

- 009e25d: Report / chart / query symbols stop wearing `@objectstack/spec`'s names
  (objectui#3155, objectstack#4115).

  **Breaking for TypeScript imports** — six exported names change. Each was a
  different concept than the spec export it collided with, so an author reading
  the objectui declaration as "the spec's" was reading a false claim:

  | was                 | now                      | why they were never the same thing                                                                                                                               |
  | :------------------ | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `ChartSeries`       | `ChartDataSeries`        | ours is a display name plus literal `data: number[]`; the spec's is a dataset-bound series descriptor (`type`/`stack`/`yAxis`/`variant`) with no data at all     |
  | `ChartSeriesSchema` | `ChartDataSeriesSchema`  | zod twin of the above                                                                                                                                            |
  | `QueryAST`          | `SqlQueryAST`            | ours is a compiled SQL syntax tree (`select`/`from`/`join`/`group_by`); the spec's is the ObjectQL request descriptor (`object`/`fields`/`where`/`expand`)       |
  | `QuerySchema`       | `DriverQueryConfig`      | ours is the high-level config `QueryASTBuilder` compiles; the spec exports that name as a zod schema value                                                       |
  | `DriverInterface`   | `SqlDriverInterface`     | ours is objectui's SQL-oriented client abstraction (`query(sql, params)`); the spec's is the platform runtime driver contract                                    |
  | `DatasourceSchema`  | `DatasourceRegistration` | ours is the in-memory record `DatasourceManager` holds — its `driver` is a live instance; the spec's is the authored metadata document, where `driver` is a name |

  Three more are now DERIVED from the spec instead of hand-restated, which fixes
  live silent-stripping defects, since a `z.object()` drops unknown keys:

  - **`DashboardWidgetSchema`** declared 10 of the spec's 22 keys, so
    `objectui validate` deleted the other 12 without a word — `chartConfig`,
    `colorVariant`, `filter`, `responsive`, `aria`,
    `actionUrl`/`actionType`/`actionIcon`, `compareTo`, `suppressWarnings` and the
    `requiresObject` / `requiresService` capability gates the dashboard renderer
    honours at runtime. The TS interface had declared most of them all along, so a
    widget could type-check and still lose half its configuration on validation.
    Pinned divergences kept: `id` stays optional, `type` stays widened for the
    objectui-only `list` / `custom` families, and the legacy `component` envelope
    stays.
  - **`GlobalFilterSchema`** took `scope` as a free-form string (any typo
    validated); it now uses the spec's `widget | dashboard` vocabulary. The three
    objectui widenings that back a real runtime normalizer are kept and pinned:
    the bare-string `options` shorthand, the normalized `{ preset }` date default,
    and an optional `optionsFrom.labelField`.
  - **`AppContextSelectorSchema`** was a full restatement; spec keys and their
    defaults now flow in by reference, with `label` widened for objectui's i18n
    label envelope — which `AppContextSelectors` already renders.

  `ListViewSchema`'s zod node now names the spec in its own initializer rather
  than one hop away through a local const, so its long-standing derivation is
  visible where it is declared.

  Drift guard: `packages/types/src/__tests__/report-chart-query-spec-parity.test.ts`.

- 726b89c: `@object-ui/types` stops declaring sixteen symbols under names `@objectstack/spec` owns (objectui#3156, objectstack#4115).

  Seven are now **derived** from the spec, nine are **renamed** to the local
  dialect they always were. Both halves remove the same hazard: a local
  declaration under a spec export's name reads as the spec's own definition to
  the next reader, so a copy that is merely _correct today_ is a planted premise
  tomorrow.

  **Derived** — the spec now supplies the keys, by reference:

  | symbol                   | derivation                                                                        |
  | :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `ActionParam`            | `z.input<typeof ActionParamSchema>`, `type` widened to the local legacy spellings |
  | `CreateExportJobRequest` | `Omit<CreateExportJobInput, 'object'>` (`object` is the method argument)          |
  | `CreateExportJobResult`  | re-export from `@objectstack/spec/contracts`                                      |
  | `ImportRowResult`        | re-export from `@objectstack/spec/api`                                            |
  | `NavigationArea`         | spec keys, with `navigation` / `visible` pinned locally                           |
  | `NavigationAreaSchema`   | `specFieldsExcept(NavigationAreaSchema.shape, …)`                                 |
  | `Theme`                  | re-export of the spec's `ThemeInput` (the authoring shape)                        |
  | `ExportJobFormat`        | re-export of the spec's `ExportFormat`                                            |

  Four of these close real gaps rather than tidy names. `ActionParam` never
  declared `reference` — the key `resolveActionParams()` actually reads for an
  inline lookup target — nor `defaultFromRow`, which the metadata designer's own
  inspector writes; it also narrowed `visible` to a bare string although the
  resolver has always accepted the `{ dialect, source }` envelope too.
  `CreateExportJobResult.createdAt` and `ImportRowResult.action` were optional
  here and required by the server, leaving every consumer a branch that could
  never run. And `NavigationArea`'s `id` now carries the spec's own length rule
  instead of accepting any string.

  **Renamed** — same word, different concept:

  | was                | now                      | why                                                                                                                            |
  | :----------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `FileMetadata`     | `UploadedFileMetadata`   | field-VALUE payload (`url`, `original_name`), not the storage file record                                                      |
  | `GestureType`      | `TouchGestureType`       | direction-fused (`swipe-left`), not the spec's type+direction pair                                                             |
  | `GestureConfig`    | `TouchGestureConfig`     | gesture→`action` binding, not per-gesture tuning                                                                               |
  | `OfflineConfig`    | `PWAOfflineConfig`       | service-worker route caching, not the offline data/sync model                                                                  |
  | `PageRegion`       | `PageNodeRegion`         | region of the renderer page NODE, holding `SchemaNode`s                                                                        |
  | `PageRegionSchema` | `PageNodeRegionSchema`   | zod twin of the above                                                                                                          |
  | `ResponsiveConfig` | `MobileResponsiveConfig` | mobile box config, not the spec's SDUI grid contract                                                                           |
  | `WidgetManifest`   | `RuntimeWidgetManifest`  | SDUI component manifest, not the field-widget plugin manifest                                                                  |
  | `WidgetSource`     | `RuntimeWidgetSource`    | `module`/`inline`/`registry` loader union — and its `inline` carries a resolved component where the spec's carries source code |

  **Migration**: the old names are gone, not deprecated — an alias would preserve
  exactly the ambiguity being removed. Import the new name; nothing about the
  shapes changed. `@object-ui/types` already re-exports the spec's own
  `SpecResponsiveConfig`, and `@object-ui/react`'s `useOffline` config remains the
  spec-shaped `OfflineConfig`, so both concepts stay reachable under
  distinguishable names.

  Each rename carries a bidirectional tripwire
  (`packages/types/src/__tests__/page-nav-misc-spec-parity.test.ts`): it fails if
  the spec ever claims the new name, and also if the spec retires the old one —
  at which point the natural name can be taken back rather than the workaround
  outliving its reason.

### Patch Changes

- d9668a7: Honor the server's declared percent scale, so a ratio of exactly 1 renders as 100.0% (#3136)

  A dataset measure declared `format: '0.0%'` rendered every ratio below 1
  correctly and got the single most consequential one wrong: a rate of exactly
  `1` printed as **`1.0%`**. On an SLA / pass-rate dashboard that turns
  "everything met the SLA" into "1% met the SLA", on both surfaces the issue
  names — the KPI card and the dataset-bound table (they share `formatMeasure`).

  The cause was never a bad multiplier; it was a missing fact. `formatMeasure`
  scaled by magnitude — `percentDisplayValue` multiplies by 100 only strictly
  inside `(-1, 1)` — because the column arrived with a `%` format string and
  nothing saying what scale its numbers were on. That guess is undecidable at
  exactly 1, which is both a full-compliance ratio ("100%") and one percentage
  point ("1%"), and it resolved to the reading almost nobody means.

  The server now answers the question instead (framework: `percentScaleOf` +
  `AnalyticsResult.fields[].percentScale`, the sibling of the ADR-0053 currency
  chain): a `derived: { op: 'ratio' }` measure is a `fraction` by definition, and
  a measure over a `percent` field inherits that field's scale. `formatMeasure`
  takes the declared scale as a fourth argument and, when present, scales by it —
  `fraction` ×100, `whole` verbatim — instead of inspecting the value. Every
  dataset-bound call site passes the column's `percentScale`: the dashboard
  metric/table/pivot cells, the report renderer's cells, totals and KPI, and the
  dataset preview.

  `percentDisplayValue` is untouched and still the fallback for a column that
  arrives without the annotation (an older server, or a non-dataset percent cell
  in a list view), so nothing that renders correctly today changes.

- a8ad6c0: A required boolean must be savable in its UNCHECKED state — `false` and `0` are values.

  Reported against an AI-built task tracker whose 任务 object has a required
  `是否完成` boolean: the create form showed the switch OFF, answered "是否完成不能
  为空", and saved instantly once the switch was turned ON. The app could only ever
  create ALREADY-DONE tasks — the one state the control shows by default was the
  one value it refused to save (cloud#972).

  Two defects stacked, and either alone is enough to break it:

  **The `required` verdict read truthiness, not presence.** `@objectstack/spec`
  FieldSchema.required (ADR-0113) is "an insert must provide a NON-NULL value",
  and objectql's record validator implements exactly that. react-hook-form's
  built-in rule instead fails whenever `isBoolean(value) && !value` — its
  accept-the-terms checkbox heritage — silently redefining every required boolean
  as "must be TRUE", including a select whose chosen option value is `false`. It
  also disagreed the other way, letting a whitespace-only string through for the
  server to reject with a 400. The form renderer no longer hands RHF its own
  `required`: the check is now a `validate` entry keyed `required` (so the error
  still surfaces as `type: 'required'`, which the conditional-required cleanup
  keys on) backed by a new shared `isMissingForRequired` in `@object-ui/core`, a
  deliberate mirror of objectql `record-validator.isMissing` — `undefined`,
  `null`, blank-after-trim string, empty array. Deleting the inherited rule also
  stops a `required` that rode in on `validation` from outliving a `requiredWhen`
  that resolved to FALSE.

  **A boolean field held `undefined` while displaying "off".** A two-state control
  has no third state, but a field with no entry in `defaultValues` rendered an OFF
  switch backed by nothing: the create payload omitted the column (it lands null,
  which reads as unchecked but isn't) and the presence check above would still
  refuse it. The form renderer now folds `false` into `defaultValues` for every
  boolean-widget field the caller left unset — in `defaultValues` itself, not
  per-Controller, because that object is also the dirty-check baseline and what
  the defaults-reset window replays. Every surface gets it, including the
  modal/drawer create dialogs that start from a bare `{}`. An authored default
  (or a loaded record, `null` included) still wins.

  `WizardForm`'s cross-step gate had its own copy of the empty-value predicate; it
  now imports the shared one so it cannot drift from the per-field verdict. And
  the field-demo renderer read `schema.defaultValue || schema.value`, throwing
  away an authored default of `false` / `0` / `''` — same falsy-as-empty class,
  now `??`.

  Verified end to end on a local stack against the exact metadata shape
  `apply_blueprint` materializes (`{ type: 'boolean', required: true }`, no
  default): a 是否完成 = 否 task with 工时 = 0 now creates and persists as
  `{ hours: 0, is_done: false }`, turning the switch on still stores `true`, and a
  blank required text is still refused.

### Minor Changes

- 62311b6: feat(core): inventory `ActionDef`'s keys and warn on the ones nothing reads — objectstack#4075 step 1

  `ActionDef` ends with `[key: string]: any`, so it accepts any key of any type.
  Deleting `ActionDef.execute` produced **zero** compile errors even though the
  field had just been removed (objectui#2990), and stale metadata still authoring
  `execute: 'markDone'` type-checks today. The same deletion against
  `@object-ui/types`' `ActionSchema` — which has no index signature — correctly
  produced `TS2353` at the authoring site. One of the two readers can catch a
  retired key; the other is structurally incapable, which is how a typo (`targt`)
  and a tombstoned key both reach a runner that then silently does nothing.

  This is the non-breaking first step of the staged narrowing: it makes the key set
  **visible** and warns on anything outside it, without changing a single type.

  New exports from `@object-ui/core`:

  - `ACTION_DEF_KEYS`, `SPEC_ACTION_KEYS`, `NAVIGATION_ALIAS_KEYS`,
    `RETIRED_ACTION_KEYS`, `KNOWN_ACTION_KEYS` — the inventory.
  - `classifyActionKeys(action)` — splits an action's own keys into `unknown` and
    `retired`.
  - `warnOnUnknownActionKeys(action)` — dev-mode only, warn-once. Called by
    `ActionRunner.execute`, so no consumer wiring is needed.

  A retired key gets a louder, more specific warning than an unknown one: an
  unknown key is probably a typo, a retired key is metadata that used to work.
  `execute` is not simply gone from the spec — it is a live **tombstone**, still
  present in `ActionSchema` so the parser can reject it by name with the rename
  prescription.

  Nothing is rejected and no types changed, so existing metadata behaves exactly as
  before. Promoting the legitimate keys to explicit optional fields, then removing
  the index signature so `tsc` catches both typos and retired keys, are steps 2 and
  3 of objectstack#4075.

- 9e7349e: **`target` is the only action handler slot — the `execute` alias is gone from the renderer (framework#3856).**

  `ActionRunner.executeScript` read `action.target || action.execute`. That fallback
  is unreachable against `@objectstack/spec` 17: `execute` is now a tombstoned key
  (framework#3855) that the parser **rejects** with the rename prescription, so no
  parsed action can carry it and the `||` could only ever yield `target`. Verified
  against 17.0.0-rc.0 — an action declaring `execute` fails `ActionSchema.safeParse`,
  and a `target` action's parsed output has no `execute` key at all.

  Deleted rather than left as harmless residue: two handler slots is what let one
  action run one script server-side and a different one client-side (framework#3713,
  where this renderer preferred the alias while the spec transform preferred
  `target`). A dead slot still reads as a live contract to the next maintainer.

  `execute` is also **removed from the types**, which is the part that had never
  landed. framework#3856 predicted a compile error here; there wasn't one, because
  neither reader was typed against the spec's `z.infer`:

  - `@object-ui/types` `ActionSchema` hand-declared `execute?: string`. Removed, so
    `execute: '…'` now fails `tsc` at the authoring site (TS2353).
  - `@object-ui/core` `ActionDef` hand-declared it too. Removed — but `ActionDef`
    carries a `[key: string]: any` index signature, so stale hand-authored metadata
    that never passed through the parser still compiles. For that path
    `executeScript` now returns the rename prescription instead of a bare
    "No script provided", matching the spec tombstone's rule that removing an
    authorable key must be audible: silently binding no handler is the
    "Mark Done does nothing" shape (framework#2169).

  The four action renderers (`action:button`, `action:icon`, `action:menu`,
  `action:group`) no longer forward `execute` into the runner, and Studio's
  `ActionPreview` no longer falls back to it — previewing an alias-only draft as
  "bound" contradicted the parse that rejects it on save.

  Requires `@objectstack/spec` 17. Metadata still on the alias is rewritten by
  `os migrate meta --from 16`.

- 6ae818e: feat(core): one column identity per column — `field` stamped at ingestion (#3104)

  A column's field identity was resolved twice, with two different precedences
  over the same `schema.columns` array, and the two halves disagreed:

  - **request path** — `ListView`'s `$expand` and `$select` builders, and
    `ObjectGrid.getSelectFields`, read `f?.field` and only `f?.field`.
  - **render path** — the FLS gate, the hidden-field filter, `fieldOrder`, both
    export branches and the hide-fields popover read
    `f.name || f.fieldName || f.field` — name FIRST.

  So `{ field: 'account', name: 'account_name' }` fetched `account` while the
  renderer keyed off `account_name`, and `{ name: 'account' }` rendered a column
  the request dropped entirely — neither `$select` nor `$expand` carried it. That
  is the mechanism behind the "relation column shows a bare id / column is empty
  / sort does nothing / export is missing a column" defect class.

  Per AGENTS.md #0.1 the fix is not another `?? name` at the read sites. Legacy
  acceptance moves to the one boundary that already folds this view's vocabulary,
  `normalizeListViewSchema`, which now also canonicalizes each column's identity.

  New in `@object-ui/core`:

  - `columnIdentity(entry)` — the single reader. Resolves `field` → `name` →
    `fieldName`, canonical-first, so it agrees with `buildExpandFields` instead
    of racing it. Handles bare-string columns.
  - `normalizeColumnIdentity(entry)` / `normalizeColumnIdentities(columns)` — the
    fold. Stamps `field`; a legacy key that is **already present** is mirrored
    onto the same identity so name-first readers resolve what the request asked
    for; a legacy key that is **absent is never invented**, and an
    already-canonical column is returned by reference.
  - `hasConflictingColumnIdentity(entry)` — true when a column's keys disagree.
  - `CANONICAL_COLUMN_IDENTITY_KEY`, `LEGACY_COLUMN_IDENTITY_KEYS`,
    `TABLE_ADAPTER_COLUMN_KEY`.

  The fold **mirrors** rather than deleting the legacy key, unlike the other
  folds in `normalizeListViewSchema`. Deleting would work inside this repo (every
  name-first read falls through to `field`), but `columns` entries cross the
  package boundary into host renderers and dropping `name` from under them is a
  breaking change with no inventory. Deletion is a later call, once the in-repo
  consumers read `columnIdentity()`.

  Behaviour is unchanged for any column carrying a single identity key — every
  read site resolves the same string it did before. The entries whose resolution
  moves are exactly the ones where two sites already disagreed.

  `accessorKey` is deliberately untouched: it is TanStack Table's own column key
  (`TableColumn.accessorKey`), not ObjectStack metadata identity, and folding
  across that boundary would fossilize the merge.

- 746dd00: feat(sdui): curate the page:\*, element:\* and action:\* families into the public contract

  The AI-authoring vocabulary and the Studio page designer disagreed by thirteen
  blocks: `PUBLIC_BLOCKS` carried one `page:` tag and one `element:` tag while
  the designer palette — and @objectstack/spec's page schema — offered the whole
  families. A block a human can drag in Studio was invisible to a model writing
  the same page, which is the objectui#3006 state at 10× the scale.

  Fifteen tags join the contract (36 → 42 → **57**), every one shipping a
  renderer with declared inputs (objectui#3065):

  - `page:` — tabs, card, accordion, section, footer, sidebar
  - `element:` — text, number, button, definition-list, repeater
  - `action:` — button, group, menu, icon

  Five stay out, each with its reason recorded and guarded: `action:bar`
  (`record:quick_actions` covers the record action strip; the spec blesses the
  other four), `element:image` (duplicates the curated `image` — one spelling
  per concept), and `element:record_picker` / `element:text_input` /
  `element:metadata_viewer` (mirroring the Studio palette's own exclusions, so
  the two vocabularies stay out for the same reasons rather than by
  coincidence).

  The console's reverse-coverage guard now sweeps all four semantic namespaces
  instead of `record:` alone — checking only the namespace you just fixed is
  exactly how the last 22 doubled keys went unnoticed (objectui#3037). A new
  prop-less allowlist (`element:divider`, `page:section`, `page:footer`,
  `page:sidebar`) keeps "declares no inputs" a pinned decision in both
  directions: those four must stay at zero, everything else curated must declare
  a surface.

- 38ca8be: refactor(fields): `requiredWhen` is the only required-predicate slot — drop the retired `conditionalRequired` alias

  `@objectstack/spec` 17 (objectstack#3855) **retired** `Field.conditionalRequired`,
  the long-deprecated alias of `requiredWhen`. ObjectUI carried a back-compat read
  for it in seven places; all of them are removed.

  The removal is safe because the spec did not merely _stop emitting_ the key — it
  made authoring it **fail loudly**. `retiredKey()` declares the key as
  `z.never()`, so:

  - `z.input` types it as `never` — writing it is a `tsc` error at the authoring site;
  - the parse **rejects** it (verified against `17.0.0-rc.0`), at both `FieldSchema`
    and `ObjectSchema`, with the prescription as the message:

    > `conditionalRequired` was removed in @objectstack/spec 17 (#3855) — use
    > `requiredWhen`. Rename the key; the value (a CEL predicate) is unchanged.
    > Run `os migrate meta --from 16` to rewrite it automatically.

  So spec-parsed metadata cannot carry the key — an object declaring it fails to
  load rather than loading with the rule silently dropped. Keeping a renderer-side
  `requiredWhen ?? conditionalRequired` would have re-created exactly the second
  de-facto contract the tombstone exists to prevent: the key would have kept
  working in the UI while being rejected everywhere else, hiding the producer's bug
  (AGENTS.md #0.1). "Backend-agnostic" (#1) does not argue for keeping it either —
  `conditionalRequired` is an ObjectStack-spec-ism, so the only producers that ever
  emit it are ObjectStack producers on ≤16, and the spec ships them a converter.

  Removed from:

  | package                  | site                                                                                                      |
  | :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `@object-ui/types`       | the `conditionalRequired?:` member on `FormField`                                                         |
  | `@object-ui/core`        | the `??` fallback + rules-param member in `resolveFieldRuleState`                                         |
  | `@object-ui/components`  | three pass-throughs in the form renderer                                                                  |
  | `@object-ui/plugin-form` | `ObjectForm`, `ModalForm`, `sectionFields`, `deriveMasterDetail` (×2)                                     |
  | `@object-ui/app-shell`   | the field inspector's legacy read/auto-migrate, and the key's entry in `clientValidation`'s CEL lint list |

  **Studio authors lose nothing.** The object designer's draft validation parses
  against the spec's own `ObjectSchema`, so a draft carrying the key now surfaces
  the tombstone's rename prescription under the same `fields.<name>.conditionalRequired`
  path the CEL lint used to report — a better message than the inspector's silent
  auto-migration, and one the server agrees with. That behavior is pinned by a test.

  **Migrating:** rename the key to `requiredWhen` (the CEL value is unchanged), or
  run `os migrate meta --from 16`.

- 02aef0c: fix(sdui): a `kind:'html'` page can use lazily-registered blocks, and recovers when one registers late

  objectui#2953 had a twin one tier over, unreported. The whitelist a
  `kind:'html'` page's source compiles against was built from `getAllTypes()` +
  `getConfig()` — both loaded-only — so any block registered via `registerLazy()`
  was rejected as _"not an allowed component"_.

  The blast radius is worse than the react tier's. There, a missing block cost one
  identifier; here a compile diagnostic fails the **whole page**, so a single
  `<object-kanban>` replaced the entire page with `HTML page failed to compile (2)`.
  And it never recovered: `layoutElement` was memoised on `[schema, pageType]` with
  no registry signal, so the cached error panel outlived the plugin actually
  landing — permanently broken for the session.

  `ComponentRegistry` gains three lazy-aware reads:

  - `getKnownTypes()` — loaded registrations **plus** pending lazy stubs, deduped.
    The set a whitelist or manifest should be built from. `getAllTypes()` keeps its
    loaded-only meaning ("what can render right now") and now says so.
  - `getMeta(type, namespace?)` — metadata from the loaded registration, else from
    a pending stub. `getConfig()` stays loaded-only, since callers read
    `.component` off it.
  - `getVersion()` — monotonic counter of changes to the known set, bumped on
    register / unregister / registerLazy. A cache key that a type _count_ cannot
    substitute for: one registration plus one unregistration leaves the count
    untouched while the set changed.

  `getJsxManifest()` builds from those, and `PageRenderer` subscribes to the
  registry so a page that could not compile retries when the registry grows.

  A stub carries no `inputs` yet, so its props surface as `unknown-prop` warnings
  rather than errors — the page compiles and renders, and the inner
  `SchemaRenderer` triggers the loader and swaps in the real block. Authoring-time
  prop validation is unaffected: `sdui.manifest.json` is generated with every
  plugin eagerly loaded, and asserts as much.

- c4db402: refactor(views): ListView's `aria` and `sharing` are the spec sub-shapes (#2890 scope A step 5)

  Last rename batch in the ListView vocabulary migration.

  **`aria`** is now the spec's `AriaPropsSchema`: `label` → `ariaLabel`,
  `describedBy` → `ariaDescribedBy`, folded at the ListView boundary like every
  other legacy key. Two things fall out of adopting the spec shape:

  - `role` becomes authorable. The list region hardcoded `role="region"`; it now
    reads `aria.role` and falls back to `region`.
  - `aria.live` stays as a documented local extension — it has no spec
    counterpart, and dropping it would silently disable a shipped capability.
    Promote it rather than growing that extension.

  **`sharing`** is now the spec's `ViewSharingSchema` (`{ type, lockedBy }`),
  imported by reference — the local four-key object is gone. The legacy pair folds
  in: `visibility` collapses onto the two ownership kinds the spec models (only
  `private` is `personal`; `team` / `organization` / `public` are all
  `collaborative`), and a bare `enabled: true` maps to `personal`, which is the
  badge the user already saw (the old title fell back to `'private'`).

  _Visible change_: the share badge's tooltip shows the spec ownership type, so a
  view authored with `visibility: 'team'` reads "Sharing: collaborative" instead
  of "Sharing: team". The four-value audience has no spec home and nothing but
  that tooltip consumed it; keeping a second audience enum alive would re-open the
  fork this issue closes.

  Also fixes the **spec bridge**, which was doing the opposite of its job: given a
  spec-shaped `sharing`, `transformListView` _downgraded_ it — inventing a legacy
  `visibility` audience and an `enabled` flag that the renderer then had to fold
  back. Both sides speak `ViewSharing` now, so it passes through.

  `conditionalFormatting` and `exportOptions` are deliberately **not** folded.
  Both objectui shapes are supersets carrying capability the spec cannot express —
  the `{ field, operator, value }` rule form, and `maxRecords` / `includeHeaders`
  / `fileNamePrefix`. Folding them onto the narrower spec shapes would delete
  working features; they want promotion upstream, not a rename.

- 5319bf1: feat(views): the list toolbar speaks one vocabulary — `userActions` (#2890 scope A step 3)

  The seven bare `show*` toolbar flags fold into the spec's `userActions`, and the
  renderer reads nothing else. `showDescription` folds into
  `appearance.showDescription` at the same boundary.

  | legacy                                                    | canonical                                                 |
  | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `showSearch` / `showSort` / `showFilters` / `showDensity` | `userActions.search` / `.sort` / `.filter` / `.rowHeight` |
  | `showGroup` / `showHideFields` / `showColor`              | `userActions.group` / `.hideFields` / `.rowColor`         |
  | `showDescription`                                         | `appearance.showDescription`                              |

  **The last three are new keys, and they close a capability hole rather than just
  renaming one.** `@objectstack/spec`'s `UserActionsConfigSchema` documents itself
  as "which interactive actions are available to users in the view toolbar — each
  boolean toggles the corresponding toolbar element on/off", and already carries
  `rowHeight` (objectui's `showDensity` under its spec name). Grouping, column
  visibility and row coloring are the same kind of toggle: the spec models all
  three as _configuration_ (`grouping`, `hiddenFields`, `rowColor`) but has no
  "may the user change it" switch for any of them.

  The consequence was visible in the product. With no `userActions` key to read,
  the two list surfaces **hardcoded opposite policies**: `InterfaceListPage` (the
  author-curated interface page) pinned all three OFF, `ObjectDataPage` pinned two
  ON — and an interface-page author could not turn grouping back on for end users
  at all. Both surfaces now express their policy as `userActions` defaults, which
  an author can override.

  Until the keys land in `@objectstack/spec`, `@object-ui/types` carries them as a
  documented `.extend()` on `UserActionsConfigSchema` (the same shape
  `ListColumnSchema` uses while waiting on objectstack#3761); it collapses into a
  plain re-export once they do. Note the spec schema is not `.strict()`, so before
  this an author writing `userActions: { group: false }` had it **silently
  stripped** — valid on parse, no effect at render.

  Defaults are unchanged and deliberately asymmetric, matching what these flags
  have always done: `search` / `sort` / `filter` / `rowHeight` / `group` are on
  unless turned off; `hideFields` / `rowColor` are off unless turned on. Making
  them uniform would grow two buttons on every existing view, so it is left as its
  own product decision rather than smuggled into a vocabulary migration.

  Also drops a dead relay in app-shell's `ObjectView`, which forwarded
  `showDescription` onto the node although `ListView` has only ever read
  `appearance.showDescription`.

- f59f2c1: refactor(actions): `navigation` becomes a named alias of the spec's `url`, sharing one navigator (#2944)

  The last open item of #2944: `ActionRunner` dispatched a seventh action type,
  `navigation`, that `@objectstack/spec`'s `ActionType` does not contain. The issue
  asked for a decision — promote it upstream or delete the case. Neither, as stated.

  - **Promoting it is wrong.** The spec already has `url` for "go to a location",
    with `openIn` for the new-tab/same-tab choice. A seventh type would put a
    second spec name on one operation, which is the exact failure the #2901 audit
    is named after: _a second definition of the vocabulary exists, and the renderer
    is faithful to the wrong one_.
  - **Deleting it is worse, because it is silent.** `{ type: 'navigation', to: … }`
    is authored today (`element:button` CTAs). Without the case the action falls
    through to `executeActionSchema`, which returns `{ success: true }` — a green
    toast that navigates nowhere. That is #2960's trap.

  So it stays, but stops being dialect. `ObjectUiLocalActionType` /
  `OBJECTUI_LOCAL_ACTION_TYPES` in `@object-ui/types` declare it as objectui's own
  alias of `url` — the same treatment #2985 gave `PageVisualizationAlias` — and the
  runner routes both names through one navigator.

  **The alias had already drifted, which is the point.** `executeNavigation` was
  quietly the weaker of the two implementations: no `${param.X}` / `${ctx.X}`
  interpolation, `openIn` ignored, and no `/api/…` full-page short-circuit (the
  redirect-dance case `url` exists to handle). An author who wrote
  `{ type: 'navigation', to: '/x?p=${param.p}' }` shipped the literal `${param.p}`,
  while the identical `url` action resolved it. Both names now behave identically;
  `url` in turn gains `replace` pass-through, the one modifier only the alias had.

  Additive only. `replace` is omitted from the `NavigationHandler` options object
  when unset, so hosts see the option shape they already saw.

  The new guard is structural rather than another assertion. The runner's built-in
  dispatch is a table typed `Record<RunnableActionType, …>` instead of a `switch`,
  so an `ActionType` the spec **adds** stops compiling until an executor exists for
  it — the Tier-2 "validates at save, renders nothing at run time" failure (#2942)
  becomes a build error for actions. `spec-derived-unions.test.ts` additionally
  asserts `navigation` is _absent_ from the spec enum, so the day it is adopted
  upstream, the test fails and names the alias to retire.

- ce08d55: chore(deps): upgrade `@objectstack/*` to 17.0.0-rc.0, and let the spec take back what it now owns

  `spec` / `client` / `formula` / `lint` move from `^16.x` to `^17.0.0-rc.0`. Two
  groups of v17 changes reach this repo, and they pull in opposite directions —
  the spec pruned surface objectui re-exported, and adopted surface objectui had
  been carrying locally.

  **The spec pruned dead Theme config (objectstack#3494), so the re-exports went
  with it.** `ThemeSchema` dropped `spacing`, `breakpoints`, `logo`, `density`,
  `wcagContrast`, `rtl`, `touchTarget` and `keyboardNavigation` — authorable but
  never enforced, so authoring them was already a silent no-op. `@object-ui/types`
  re-exported those sub-schemas _by reference_ (issue #2231), so they could not
  survive the prune without becoming hand-written mirrors — exactly the second
  de-facto contract AGENTS.md #0.1 forbids. Removed from the public surface:

  - Types: `Spacing`, `Breakpoints`, `DensityMode`, `WcagContrastLevel`,
    `ThemeLogo`, and the deprecated `SpacingScale` alias
  - Schemas: `SpacingSchema`, `SpacingScaleSchema`, `BreakpointsSchema`,
    `ThemeLogoSchema`, and the `SpacingSchemaType` / `BreakpointsSchemaType` helpers
  - `Theme.spacing`, `Theme.breakpoints` and `Theme.logo`

  `mergeThemes` no longer merges the three dropped keys. `generateThemeVars` is
  unaffected — it never emitted them, which is why the liveness audit called them
  dead. The one real consumer was `ThemeProvider`, which set the favicon from
  `theme.logo.favicon`; that path is gone, because v17 strips the key at parse and
  it could never arrive again. The live favicon is unaffected: it comes from
  operator branding (`getFaviconUrl()`), applied in the console's `index.html`,
  `main.tsx`, and on route change.

  Nothing else read the pruned types. In particular the list-density feature is
  untouched — `useDensityMode` and `rowHeightToDensityMode` use `@object-ui/core`'s
  own local `DensityMode`, which never came from the spec.

  **The spec adopted objectui's ListColumn extensions (objectui#2231), so the
  extension collapsed.** `ListColumnSchema` used to `.extend()` the spec with two
  fields, each carrying a note to promote it upstream rather than grow the
  extension; v17 did exactly that. `summary` is now the spec's
  `union([ColumnSummarySchema, ColumnSummaryConfigSchema])` — the same enum ∪
  `{ type, field }` form `useColumnSummary` reads — and `prefix` is the spec's
  `ColumnPrefixSchema`. `ListColumnSchema` is now a plain by-reference re-export.
  One behavior change rides along: `prefix.type` defaults to `'text'` on parse
  instead of staying `undefined`, so the cell renderer always gets a value.

  **Node 22 is now the floor.** Every `@objectstack` package declares
  `engines.node: ">=22.0.0"` (objectstack#3825; Node 20 reached EOL 2026-04-30).
  This repo claimed `>=20` and ran CI on Node 20.x, so it promised — and validated
  — a runtime its own core dependency does not support. `engines.node` is now
  `>=22`, CI runs Node 22.x, and the CI/deployment docs say so.

  The major stays 17: per AGENTS.md the major tracks `@objectstack`'s major, which
  is also 17, and that convention deliberately outranks semver purity — so the
  removals above ship as a minor rather than desyncing the two.

- 390c071: feat(record): declare inputs for the seven configurable record:\* blocks, and curate six

  Seven `record:*` blocks shipped with renderers that read props but declared no
  `inputs`. That combination is the worst of both: the renderer honours
  `limit`, `severity`, `location` …, while every authoring surface — the designer
  panel, the AI vocabulary, the generated manifest — reports the block takes no
  configuration. objectui#3013 recorded them as deliberately uncurated for
  exactly that reason.

  The declarations mirror what each renderer actually reads:

  | block                                  | inputs                                                                       |
  | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `record:activity`                      | 11 — from `RecordActivityComponentProps`                                     |
  | `record:chatter` / `record:discussion` | 5 — from `RecordChatterComponentProps`                                       |
  | `record:alert`                         | 8 — severity, title, body, visible, icon, action, dismissible, dismissKey    |
  | `record:quick_actions`                 | 7 — actionNames, requiredPermissions, location, align, inline, variant, size |
  | `record:history`                       | 3 — limit, emptyText, unknownUserText                                        |
  | `record:reference_rail`                | 1 — hideEmpty                                                                |

  `inputs` describe what an AUTHOR writes, which is a subset of what the renderer
  reads. `entries`, `loading` and resolved `actions` are injected by the host
  shell off RecordContext; declaring them would invite a model to hand-write the
  data the page is supposed to fetch. `aria` is omitted for the reason it is
  omitted on `record:details` — an accessibility escape hatch, not a layout
  choice. `location` takes its enum from the spec's `ACTION_LOCATIONS` rather
  than restating it, per objectui#3019.

  Six of the seven are now in `PUBLIC_BLOCKS`: configurable and absent from the
  contract is the state objectui#3006 was about. The contract goes 36 → 42 tags,
  all resolving.

  `record:chatter` stays out — it is the same renderer as `record:discussion`
  under a Salesforce-familiar name, kept for schemas already in the wild. Two
  spellings of one block is ambiguity an authoring model cannot resolve, so the
  vocabulary carries the spec's name. A test compares the two input lists, so the
  day they diverge the exclusion stops being justified and fails.

  A companion assertion requires every curated `record:*` tag to declare inputs.
  A curated tag with none reads as "takes no configuration" when the renderer in
  fact reads props — the same gap objectui#3006 opened, pointed the other way.

- 912496d: feat(types,core): the `*Validation` rule types derive from spec 17, and the engine agrees with the server — objectstack#4115

  The five spec-named rule variants in `data-protocol.ts` were hand-written
  interfaces, each labelled `(ObjectStack Spec v2.0.1)` while the installed spec
  was `17.0.0-rc.0`. Nothing bound them to the spec, so fifteen majors of drift
  accumulated with `tsc` silent throughout and the comment still vouching for it.
  They are now `z.input` derivations of `ScriptValidationSchema` /
  `StateMachineValidationSchema` / `CrossFieldValidationSchema` /
  `ConditionalValidationSchema` / `FormatValidationSchema`, and canonicity is
  carried by that binding plus a parity gate rather than by a comment (#3017).

  `z.input`, not `z.infer`, because objectui consumes **authored** metadata as it
  arrives over `/meta` — before the spec applies its defaults and canonicalizes
  expressions. That is the shape actually in the JSON.

  **Breaking, in the shape of the rule types** (minor per this repo's version
  policy — see AGENTS.md §9):

  |                                   | was                                         | is                                                      |
  | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `ConditionalValidation`           | `condition` + `rules[]`                     | `when` + `then` / `otherwise`                           |
  | `FormatValidation`                | `pattern` + `flags`, 8 named formats        | `regex`, the 4 formats the server implements            |
  | `Script`/`CrossField` `condition` | `string`                                    | `string \| { dialect, source }`                         |
  | `StateMachineValidation`          | —                                           | gains `initialStates` (objectstack#3165)                |
  | `BaseValidation`                  | no `priority`, `events` included `'delete'` | gains `priority`; `'delete'` retired (objectstack#3184) |

  `UniquenessValidation` / `AsyncValidation` / `RangeValidation` are now
  `@deprecated`. They have no spec counterpart — the spec removed the first two
  deliberately (uniqueness → a unique index, since SELECT-then-INSERT is racy;
  async → the form layer) — and the spec's `ValidationRuleSchema` rejects all
  three, so no rule in those shapes can ride in `ObjectSchema.validations`.

  **`ObjectValidationEngine` now agrees with `objectql`'s rule-validator.** It is a
  client PRE-CHECK of rules the server enforces, so every disagreement cost the
  user something real. Fixed:

  - **Polarity was inverted.** The server violates a rule when the predicate is
    TRUE; the engine violated it when the predicate was FALSE. Every
    spec-authored `script` / `cross_field` rule produced the opposite verdict.
  - **Envelope conditions were a silent no-op.** `{ dialect, source }` reached
    `expression.trim()`, threw, was caught, and read as "passes".
  - **`conditional` was a silent no-op**, reading `rule.condition` / `rule.rules`
    where the spec says `when` / `then`; `otherwise` was never evaluated at all.
  - **`format` produced FALSE REJECTIONS** — it read `rule.pattern`, and
    `undefined.test(...)` threw into a catch that reported a violation, blocking
    writes the server accepts.
  - **An absent `active` disabled the rule** and an absent `events` threw; both
    arrive absent from `/meta` because the spec defaults them at parse time.
  - `priority` now orders execution; `initialStates` is enforced on insert;
    `format`/`state_machine` only fire when the write touches the field; a broken
    predicate or an uncompilable `regex` fails OPEN with a warning; and a rule type
    the engine cannot evaluate (the spec's `json_schema`) warns instead of
    reporting the record as valid.

  The default `SimpleExpressionEvaluator` is not CEL and never was; it now binds
  both the spec's `record.x` scope and objectui's historical bare `x`, and
  documents that richer predicates need a CEL-backed evaluator. `validateRecord`'s
  `event` parameter no longer accepts `'delete'`.

  Gates: `packages/types/src/__tests__/validation-rule-spec-parity.test.ts` (key
  sets, wire shapes, the pinned `then`/`otherwise` divergence with an inverted pin
  that fails when objectstack#4171 is fixed upstream) and the rewritten engine
  suite. objectstack#4115's ledger drops 120 → 115.

### Patch Changes

- b41f401: **Authoring types are input types (framework#4074 steps 2–3): `ActionParam` takes the spec's declaration forms, `ListViewSchema` stops promising parse-output defaults, and `FormField.dependsOn` matches its runtime reader.**

  Three public types said something different from what the platform accepts. All
  three divergences were found by making `packages/types`' tests compile (#3009)
  and then resolving the declared `p1-spec-alignment.test.ts` debt site-by-site
  instead of papering over it.

  **`ActionParam` is now the authoring shape, aligned with the spec's input.**
  `name` / `label` / `type` become optional and `field` / `objectOverride` appear:
  the spec's primary way to declare a param — a bare field reference that inherits
  label/type/validation/options from an object field — was unrepresentable while
  all three were required. The _resolved_ shape the dialog consumes (after
  app-shell's `resolveActionParams()` inlines the reference) remains
  `@object-ui/core`'s `ActionParamDef`, with all three required. Authoring and
  resolved are different types on purpose. `label` and option labels take the
  spec's `I18nLabel` by import — which the new compile-time guard promptly
  revealed to be aliased to plain `string` in the current spec (the per-locale
  record is the separate `I18nObject`), so this is not a behavioural widening
  today; importing the alias means objectui tracks any future widening
  automatically.

  **Breaking:** code destructuring `param.name` / `param.label` / `param.type` as
  guaranteed must now handle the field-backed form (or consume the resolved
  `ActionParamDef` instead, which is what dialog-side code should be doing).

  **`ListViewInferred` is `z.input`, not `z.infer`.** The spec sub-schemas that
  flow into the list-view surface (`userActions`, `tabs` → `ViewTab`, `sharing`)
  carry `.default()`s, so the inferred output type made fields like
  `userActions.refresh` or a tab's `pinned`/`visible` _required_ — but nothing on
  the render path ever runs `.parse()`: `normalizeListViewSchema` deliberately
  applies no defaults ("an absent flag stays absent", its own suite). The output
  type therefore rejected valid authored metadata (`userActions: { sort: true }`)
  while promising renderers defaults that never arrive. Typing the surface as
  input matches both the author and the runtime object. Code that _trusted_ those
  phantom defaults now gets an optionality error — which is a latent bug surfacing,
  not a regression: the value really could be absent.

  **`FormField.dependsOn` is `DependsOnInput`.** The runtime reader
  (`resolveCascadingOptions`) has always accepted a bare name, a list of names, or
  lookup-parameter entries `{ field, param }` — its parameter type says so. The
  public property said `string`, so array-authored metadata type-errored while
  working, and the form renderer read the key through `(f as any).dependsOn` to
  get past its own type. The shape now lives in `@object-ui/types` (single source
  of truth next to `FormField`), `@object-ui/core` imports and re-exports it, and
  the two `as any` reads in the components form renderer are typed.

  **The `p1-spec-alignment.test.ts` exclusion is gone.** Its 14 errors resolved:
  the two "sharing in ObjectUI format" tests and the legacy-ARIA-spelling fixture
  are deleted/rewritten — those dialects are _normalizer input_, folded by
  `normalizeListViewSchema` and asserted branch-by-branch in core's
  `normalize-list-view.test.ts`, the seam where the fold actually runs; asserting
  them on the canonical type only ever "passed" because nothing compiled the file.
  One fixture claimed a shape no surface ever admitted (an ObjectQL triplet as a
  spec `ViewTab.filter`) and was corrected to the rule-object form. Every test
  file in `@object-ui/types` is now compiled, with no exclusions.

  Discrimination-checked: reverting `ListViewInferred` to `z.infer`, `dependsOn`
  to `string`, or `ActionParam.name` to required each produces the expected
  compile error in the now-compiled test files (`TS2739` / `TS2322` / `TS2741`);
  restored, all projects are clean.

- 95b7214: fix(list,grid,detail,tree,core): every column resolver reads one key (#3104 PR2)

  PR1 (#3119) put a canonicalizing fold at ListView's ingestion boundary. This
  converges the 22 read sites themselves onto `columnIdentity()` from
  `@object-ui/core`, so a surface that is NOT downstream of that fold resolves
  the same identity anyway.

  That distinction is the user-visible part. A standalone `object-grid` node —
  authored directly on a page, with no `list-view` above it — never passed
  through `normalizeListViewSchema`. Its `getSelectFields` read `c.field` alone
  while the `ensureId` probe one line above read `f?.name || f?.field`, so a
  legacy `{ name: 'account' }` column reached `$select` as a literal `undefined`
  hole: the server never returned the field and every cell in that column came
  back empty. Same for `ObjectTree`, `RelatedList` and the `record:details` /
  `record:related_list` renderers.

  Converged:

  | Surface                                  | Was                                            | Now                                 |

  `accessorKey` keeps its precedence in `RelatedList` — it is TanStack Table's
  column key, not ObjectStack metadata identity, and only the `field || name`
  tail was converged. `key` stays a tail fallback in `ObjectTree` and
  `record-related-list` for the same reason: it is a generic entry key.

  Two incidental fixes that TypeScript surfaced once the resolver stopped
  returning `any`: ListView's filter-field options and its hide-fields popover
  both built entries keyed `undefined` for a column with no resolvable identity.
  Those entries could never match a column; they are now dropped.

  **Inventory re-triage.** PR1 recorded 24 family members. Two were mis-classified
  and are reclassified here rather than converged — reading what they actually
  feed shows they are not column reads at all:

  - `ViewPreview.tsx` adapts a ViewItem **form** section to what `object-form`
    selects by (`field` → `name`) — the #3090 two-layer join.
  - `SchemaForm.tsx` renders an arbitrary metadata **array** into a popover
    summary and guesses at a display key; the entries are validations, actions,
    or whatever the JSON schema declares.

  So the family was 22, and it is now **0**. The ratchet asserts that, asserts
  each converged surface actually routes through the shared reader (a surface
  that dropped identity resolution instead of converging it goes red), and pins
  `accessorKey`'s precedence in `RelatedList`.

- 7d9734d: feat(core): say which column identity key won, out loud (#3104 PR3)

  Closes the battle opened in #3104. PR1 (#3119) put the canonicalizing fold at
  ingestion; PR2 (#3122) converged all 22 read sites onto `columnIdentity()`.
  This is the audible half.

  A column carrying two identity keys that **disagree** — `{ field: 'account',
name: 'account_name' }` — now logs a one-time dev-mode warning naming which key
  won and what to change:

  ```
  [ObjectUI] Column carries two identities: `field: 'account'` and
  `name: 'account_name'`. `field` wins — it is the only key `ListColumnSchema`
  declares — and `name` has been rewritten to match, so the rendered column and
  the requested field agree. Fix the producer: drop `name` and author `field`
  only. (objectui#3104)
  ```

  The fold making the two halves agree is what stops the bug, but silently
  rewriting `name` to match `field` also hides that the producer is emitting a
  contradiction. The renderer recovering is not the same as the metadata being
  right, so the recovery says so.

  Deliberately narrow:

  - **Only contradictions.** A legacy-only column (`{ name: 'stage' }`) is legacy,
    not conflicting — it is stamped without noise.
  - **Warn once per (identity, conflicting spelling).** Columns are re-normalized
    on every render; a warning that floods the console is a warning that gets
    muted. Keyed by the pair rather than the identity alone, so a column carrying
    two different stale spellings reports both — the author needs to fix every
    producer, not just the first one seen.
  - **Silent under `NODE_ENV=production`**, and the fold still runs there.

  `resetColumnIdentityWarnings()` is exported for tests.

  **No lint rule, and that is a measured decision.** #3104 asked for
  `no-restricted-syntax` on `.field ?? .name` to be evaluated on its
  false-positive rate first. With the family at zero, all 12 remaining scanner
  hits are legitimate — a syntactic rule cannot tell a two-layer join from a dual
  read, because the distinction is what the keys mean in that layer, not how the
  expression is spelled. Adopting it would mean 12 inline disables on correct
  code, which trains the next author to reach for the disable. The ratchet carries
  a `verdict` and a `why` per site instead, so a new hit gets triaged rather than
  silenced. The evaluation is written into the ratchet's header.

  **Ledger item resolved with no change needed.** #3104 flagged `ListColumn` for
  disposition under objectstack#4115 (spec-named symbols must be imports, not
  declarations). `ListColumnSchema` is already a by-reference re-export of
  `@objectstack/spec/ui`, and `spec-subschema-parity.test.ts` already pins it by
  reference identity — the only check that distinguishes a re-export from a
  faithful fork. Already compliant; nothing to do.

- aebfa4f: chore(core): deprecate `ObjectValidationEngine` — rule enforcement stays single-implementation on the server (#3110)

  `ObjectValidationEngine` / `defaultObjectValidationEngine` / `validateRecord` are
  now `@deprecated`. **Nothing is removed and no behaviour changes** — existing
  callers keep working exactly as they did after #3103.

  **Why.** Object-level validation rules are _enforcement_, and enforcement is
  single-implementation on the server (`objectql`'s rule-validator). objectui
  already draws that line for the predicates it _does_ evaluate client-side:
  `evaluator/fieldRules.ts` handles the presentation predicates (`visibleWhen` /
  `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen`) by delegating to the canonical
  `ExpressionEngine`, "rather than re-implementing a parallel evaluator"
  (ADR-0036). This engine was that parallel evaluator, on the enforcement side.

  #3103 converged its semantics onto the server rule-for-rule, with eight
  mutation-tested gates — and still left a known divergence: the server carries
  ADR-0113's legacy-violation exemption (reject only when the merged state violates
  _and_ this write makes it worse), which this engine does not implement. Editing
  an unrelated field on a legacy row would be blocked here and accepted there. One
  careful pass still left a gap, which is the argument: mirroring cross-repo
  behaviour is structurally unreliable, not unreliable-this-time.

  **What to use instead.** Let the write fail and render the server's rejection —
  it is already structured (`field` / `code` / `message`, plus a label since
  objectstack#3957). For pre-submit feedback, the answer is a validate-only
  (dry-run) write on the server: identical UX, zero parity risk, and it covers the
  two rule kinds a client can never check — `unique` (needs the database) and
  `json_schema` (ajv lives server-side).

  **The decision is a mechanism, not a comment.** What #3103 removed was a doc
  comment claiming spec canonicity that had been false for fifteen majors;
  shipping its successor as another comment would repeat the mistake one level up.
  `validation-engine-stays-unwired.test.ts` scans `packages/*/src` and fails if a
  production module starts referencing the engine, naming the file and the issue to
  reverse first. Barrels still re-export it — publishing a deprecated API is not
  wiring — and host applications are free to keep importing it.

  The five spec-derived rule TYPES in `@object-ui/types` are unaffected: they are
  the anchor for objectstack#4115's ledger and are independent of whether objectui
  ships an engine.

- c4d7b20: fix(view,list,core): a view's filter no longer disappears, or arrives as a predicate on columns that don't exist

  Sweeping the other `$filter` producers after #3078 turned up two live defects in
  `ObjectView`, which fetches its own data for calendar / kanban / gallery /
  timeline (grid delegates to `ObjectGrid`).

  **1. An object filter was dropped, and only for non-grid views.**
  `table.defaultFilters` is declared `Record<string, any>`, and the merge tested
  `baseFilter.length > 0` — `undefined > 0` for an object. So the filter vanished
  and the view returned **every record**. `ObjectGrid` assigns the same value
  straight to `params.$filter`, so one view definition filtered correctly as a
  grid and returned everything as a calendar.

  **2. Rule objects were spread into the `and`, not wrapped.**
  `['and', ...baseFilter, ...userFilter]` is only correct when the source is an
  array of AST nodes. `activeView.filter` is a spec `ViewFilterRule[]`, so
  spreading put bare rule objects where the AST expects nodes:

  ```js
  isFilterAST([
    "and",
    { field: "stage", operator: "eq", value: "won" },
    ["owner", "=", "me"],
  ]);
  // false → 400 since objectstack#4121
  parseFilterAST(same);
  // {$and:[{field:'stage',operator:'eq',value:'won'}, {owner:'me'}]}
  ```

  That second line is a predicate over three columns named `field`, `operator`
  and `value` — which don't exist.

  > **Correction.** The first version of this note said the spread was "reachable
  > whenever a view with a filter meets a user filter value". That was wrong for

  New in `@object-ui/core`: `toFilterNode` normalizes one source (rule array / AST
  / MongoDB object) and `mergeFilterNodes` combines sources as siblings under one
  `and`. `ObjectView` and `ListView.buildEffectiveFilter` both use them, so the
  three filter shapes are reconciled in one place instead of by hand at each
  renderer.

  `ObjectStackAdapter` also now translates a bare rule object sitting directly
  under a logical node — the chokepoint defence for any producer still emitting
  the spread shape. Only rule-_shaped_ objects are touched; a child with no
  `field` is a genuine MongoDB condition and passes through untouched.

  **Correcting a comment shipped in #3078.** `buildEffectiveFilter` documented the
  dropped-object case as unreachable, "nothing in this repo produces one for a
  list view". That was wrong: `ObjectView` passes `mergedFilters` straight into
  that schema's `filter`, and its last fallback is `table.defaultFilters`. The
  case is now handled rather than explained away.

  Verified with 19 tests across the four packages; reverting each source file
  fails the ones that cover it. Emitted filters are asserted against the spec's
  own `isFilterAST` / `parseFilterAST`, including an executable pin on what the
  old spread shape produced.

- 6f29aa5: fix(grid): a legacy string row action runs instead of green-toasting a no-op — objectui#2960

  A list view declaring `rowActions: ['convert_lead']` rendered a menu item that
  performed **zero network requests** and reported success. Where the object also
  declared the same action with `locations: ['list_item']`, the row menu showed a
  working entry and a dead duplicate of it side by side.

  **The name never became an action.** `ObjectGrid` dispatched the legacy form as
  `{ type: <action name>, params: { record } }` — the action _name_ landing in the
  runner's `type` slot, never resolved against the object's action defs. It
  matches no built-in type and (absent a handler registered under that exact name)
  no handler either, so it fell through to `ActionRunner.executeActionSchema`,
  which returned `{success: true, reload: true, close: true}` for a schema with
  nothing in it. `handlePostExecution` then fired the green "Action completed
  successfully" toast.

  Two changes, either of which would have surfaced the bug:

  **① `ObjectGrid` resolves legacy names against `objectDef.actions`.** A name
  that matches a declared action is promoted to that def and dispatched through
  the same path as a `list_item` action — so it actually runs, and it picks up the
  def's label, `visible`/`disabled` predicates, param dialog and capability gate,
  none of which the string form could carry. A name that matches an action already
  rendered as a def is dropped, which is what removes the dead twin. Names that
  resolve to nothing are still dispatched by name, since a consumer may have
  registered a runner handler under exactly that name.

  **② `ActionRunner`'s empty-schema fallthrough fails loudly.** It no longer
  reports success for an action it never ran: a dispatch with no registered
  handler and no `api`/`endpoint`/`navigate`/`redirect`/`onClick` returns a
  failure naming the action. Schema-only shapes that _do_ declare something — a
  bare `redirect`, an explicit `reload`/`close` — run exactly as before.

- ad0183a: fix(data-objectstack,core): an object filter no longer depends on whether the query expands a lookup

  #3072 single-sourced the ARRAY branch of the adapter's two `find()` routes. The
  object branch was left as it was: `convertQueryParams` converted a MongoDB-style
  filter to AST while `translateFilterToAST` returned it verbatim — so the same
  `$filter` went out in two formats, decided by whether the query happened to
  expand a lookup.

  Measured across 21 operator shapes, **four diverged**. Most of the gap turned
  out to be harmless — `{$and: […]}` survives the plain route as a
  `['$and','=',[…]]` comparison that `parseFilterAST` reads back as a real `$and`,
  and `$exists` vs `$null` is a difference the server treats identically. Two were
  not harmless:

  - **The unknown-operator guard only ran on one route.** `convertFiltersToAST`
    throws on an unrecognised operator, with a comment saying it does so "to avoid
    silent failure" — but the expanded route never called it, so a typo'd operator
    threw on a plain read and shipped silently whenever a lookup was expanded.
  - **`$regex` was silently rewritten to `contains`.** `$regex: 'a.c'` matches
    "abc"; `contains 'a.c'` matches only those three literal characters. That is a
    _different question_, not a weaker version of the same one, and neither result
    looks wrong on screen. The rewrite sat behind a `console.warn`, which is not
    an error channel in a deployed app — and the function's own unknown-operator
    message never listed `$regex` among the supported set. The spec has no
    `$regex` (`FILTER_OPERATORS`, `data/filter.zod.ts`), so there is nothing to
    translate it into: it is now refused, the same treatment the neighbouring
    unknown operator already got. Nothing in the repo depended on the conversion.

  Both refusals now throw `FilterOperatorError`, carrying `code: 'INVALID_FILTER'`
  / `httpStatus: 400`. The pre-existing unknown-operator throw was a bare `Error`,
  which `classifyLoadError` classifies as a network fault — so a malformed filter
  told the user to check their connection (#3066), the one thing it definitely
  was not.

- aa1240a: fix(sdui): lazily-registered public blocks reach a `kind:'react'` page's scope, and ReactRunner keeps the errors it catches

  Two defects in the trusted `kind:'react'` page tier.

  **objectui#2953 — the contract skipped lazy blocks.** `getPublicConfigs()`
  resolved every curated `PUBLIC_BLOCKS` tag through `getConfig()`, which reads
  loaded registrations only, so a block registered with `registerLazy()` was
  absent from the contract until its plugin chunk happened to be imported. In
  `apps/console` that silently dropped `object-kanban`, `object-calendar`,
  `object-gantt`, `object-timeline`, `object-map` and `markdown` from every react
  page's scope — writing `<ObjectKanban/>` threw `ReferenceError` even though the
  tag is a first-class contract member, and whether it threw depended on load
  order. `getPublicConfigs()` now resolves pending lazy stubs too, returning them
  with `lazy: true` and no `component` (new `PublicComponentConfig` type); the
  injected wrapper renders through `SchemaRenderer`, which triggers the loader and
  shows its placeholder. `getConfig()` stays loaded-only by design.

  **objectui#2954 — ReactRunner discarded its own error state.**
  `getDerivedStateFromProps` re-transpiled and re-evaluated the page source on
  every render and unconditionally set `error: null`. React runs it before the
  re-render that follows `getDerivedStateFromError`, so the boundary threw away
  the error it had just caught, rebuilt an identical throwing element, and the
  throw escaped past its own `fallback` to the renderer's generic panel; `onError`
  was gated on state that had already been cleared and never fired for a
  compile-time error at all; and each compile minted a fresh page function — a new
  element type — that remounted the subtree and wiped the page's `useState`. The
  transpile+eval is now memoised on `(code, scope)`, errors persist until the
  inputs actually change, and `onError` reports each error exactly once.

- d10f526: fix(sdui): the curated contract lists `record:line_items`, the tag that actually resolves

  `PUBLIC_BLOCKS` carried `line_items` — the bare tag. `@object-ui/plugin-form`
  registers the block as `record:line_items` with `skipFallback: true`, which
  exists precisely so the bare name is _not_ claimed, so that key never existed
  and the curated entry could never resolve. Its four siblings in the list are all
  `record:`-prefixed, and plugin-form's own comment says "Register
  record:line_items"; the bare spelling was a slip.

  The effect was a block that has shipped all along — a full renderer, a label,
  five declared `inputs` — being absent from the public contract, from the JSX
  type surface, from the generated manifest, and from every `kind:'react'` page's
  scope. It read as an unimplemented aspirational entry, which is how it was
  recorded when objectui#2979 added the contract-coverage guard.

  With the tag corrected the contract has no gaps left: all 36 curated tags
  resolve in the console, `record:line_items` among them with its full `inputs`.
  The guard's known-unimplemented list is now empty and stays asserted, so the
  next entry that cannot resolve surfaces instead of being explained away.

- 2d5d594: fix(list,detail): sorting a lookup column no longer orders by an invisible key — #3096

  A relational column (`lookup` / `master_detail` / `user` / `tree`) never holds
  the string its cell shows: it holds the `$expand`-ed record, or a raw foreign-key
  id whose label was resolved separately. Every sort path took that raw value as
  its key, so the column of names came back in an order with no relation to the
  names — sorting looked broken, with nothing saying the key was something else.

  The two halves are fixed differently, because they can order by different things:

  - **Client-side sorts** (grid column headers, any `data-table`, a non-windowed
    related list) now key off the label the cell renders, via the new
    `getSortValue` / `compareSortValues` in `@object-ui/core` — which resolves an
    expanded record through `getRecordDisplayName` (ADR-0079), so the sort key and
    the lookup cell agree on which field names a record. This replaces two broken
    comparators: `a[col] < b[col]` is always false between two objects (the
    comparator collapsed to a constant and permuted the rows), and
    `String(a[col])` is `"[object Object]"` (every row compared equal, so the sort
    silently did nothing).
  - **Server `$orderby` sorts** cannot be fixed here — the key is the stored id by
    construction, and `objectstack#4256` settled that no relation join is coming.
    So those entry points stop offering the illusion: the ListView toolbar sort
    picker withholds relational fields and explains why (pointing at a formula
    field as the supported way to sort by a related name), and a windowed related
    list renders no sort button for them.

  A relational field the view's CURRENT sort already uses stays listed, labelled
  `(by ID)`, so view metadata authored or saved with such a sort round-trips
  instead of rendering a blank row and losing the sort on the next edit.

- 7f23cd0: fix(form): a numeric/boolean select option survives selection with its type intact — #3090

  `SelectOptionSchema.value` has accepted `string | number | boolean` for as
  long as it has existed, but the Radix controls underneath speak strings:
  picking `{ value: 2 }` silently submitted `"2"` — a wrong-typed write into a
  number field that nothing on the client ever reported. (Display half-worked:
  a numeric default matched its numeric item; only SELECTION morphed the type.)

  The renderers now stringify on the way into the control and map the selection
  back to the AUTHORED option value on the way out (`matchOptionValue`), across
  the in-form select, the standalone `type: 'select'` component, and the
  standalone `type: 'radio-group'` component. The TS types stop lying to match:
  `SelectOption.value` / `RadioOption.value` and the corresponding
  `value`/`defaultValue`/`onChange` channels widen to what the zod schemas
  always accepted — a call site treating `option.value` as `string` is now a
  compile error pointing at a real latent crash, not a false comfort.

  The ripple the widening named, handled at each boundary: `@object-ui/core`'s
  `OptionLike.value` widens (the option engines compare by identity, so values
  flow opaquely; the option-lint's CEL-literal domain stringifies at its
  boundary), and the multi-value field widgets (checkboxes / multiselect /
  radio) stringify at theirs — multi-value fields store string arrays.

  Round-trip pinned by real Radix interactions in jsdom: the in-form select
  submits `2` (number), the standalone select hands its handler `false`
  (boolean).

### Minor Changes

- f9bbddb: feat: gate detail/form edit & delete on the server's effective operation set (#3546)

  PR-4 (#3391) wired the **list/toolbar** surface (ObjectView Import, ListView /
  ObjectGrid Export) to the server-resolved effective API operation set
  (`/me/permissions` `apiOperations`, intersected via
  `resolveCrudAffordances(obj, effectiveApiOperations?)`). The **detail / form**
  surfaces still gated edit/delete on the bucket + `userActions` alone. This
  extends the same intersection to them, so the record page and its forms never
  offer an operation the server would 405.

  - **core** `isObjectInlineEditable(obj, effectiveApiOperations?)` gains the same
    optional second argument as `resolveCrudAffordances` — inline-edit is now
    additionally ANDed with the server allowing `update`.
  - **app-shell** `RecordDetailView` threads the object's effective operations into
    the synthesized Edit/Delete header actions and the record-body inline-edit
    gate (`canEdit`); `RelatedRecordActionsBridge` intersects each **child**
    object's Create/Edit/Delete handlers with that child's own effective set.
  - **plugin-detail** `record:details` ANDs its inline-edit affordance with the
    object's effective `update`.
  - **plugin-form** `ObjectForm`'s blanket managed-object field lock also engages
    when the server denies `update` (edit mode) / `create` (create mode).

  Backward-compatible: a missing effective set (unrestricted object, older
  backend, or no `PermissionProvider`) leaves the resolved affordance untouched —
  the bucket/`userActions` decision wins, exactly as today. Layers on top of the
  existing per-object `check('edit')` / `check('delete')` permission gates
  (intersection, never union).

- 2735de6: feat: render the server's effective API operation set (#3391 PR-4)

  The frontend now consumes the per-object **effective API operation set** the
  server resolves (from `/me/permissions` `apiOperations`, framework #3391) —
  never the raw `apiMethods` — so Import/Export/New/Edit/Delete buttons match what
  the server will actually admit, and a 405 import refusal shows a dedicated
  message instead of silently falling back.

  - **core** `resolveCrudAffordances(obj, effectiveApiOperations?)` — new optional
    second argument intersects each affordance bit with its API operation
    (create/import→create/import, edit→update, delete→delete, exportCsv→export).
    Omitting it (old backend / no effective set) leaves affordances unchanged.
  - **permissions** — `/me/permissions` response carries per-object
    `apiOperations`; `PermissionContextValue.getObjectApiOperations(object)`
    exposes it (undefined when absent → callers keep current behavior); `check()`
    maps `import→allowCreate`, `export→allowRead`.
  - **app-shell** `ObjectView` intersects its toolbar affordances with the object's
    effective operations (Import); the platform-admin identity-import bypass is
    unaffected.
  - **plugin-list** `ListView` / **plugin-grid** `ObjectGrid` gate the Export
    button (and export handler) on effective `export`; `plugin-grid` gains the
    `@object-ui/permissions` workspace dependency.
  - **plugin-grid** `ImportWizard` — a 405 / `OBJECT_API_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`
    import refusal is detected by a new `isImportNotAllowed` predicate at every
    catch site (async, sync, dry-run) and STOPS with a dedicated
    `grid.import.notAllowed` message (10 locales + fallback dict) — it never falls
    back to the sync/legacy path (which 405s too), distinct from the 404
    route-absent fallback.

  Backward-compatible: a missing effective set (unrestricted object, older
  backend, or no permission provider) preserves the current default-allow
  behavior everywhere.

- cd09a7b: refactor(views): ListView reads the spec-canonical `columns`, with legacy `fields` folded in one normalizer (#2890 scope A step 1)

  `ListViewSchema` has been derived from `@objectstack/spec/ui` since #2231, but
  the renderer still spoke objectui's own vocabulary for the same concepts. First
  rename closed: **`fields` → `columns`**.

  Legacy acceptance does not disappear — stored view metadata in user databases
  carries `fields` — but it now lives in exactly one place instead of being
  re-implemented per read-site:

  - **New `normalizeListViewSchema` (`@object-ui/core`)** folds `fields` into
    `columns` (canonical wins when both are present) and drops the legacy key, so
    a read-site that was missed fails loudly instead of quietly taking the legacy
    path. It also absorbs the `viewType` renderability default ListView applied
    inline. Non-mutating, idempotent, and returns its input by reference when
    there is nothing to fold, so ListView's downstream memos keep a stable
    dependency identity.
  - **`ListView` normalizes once at the component boundary**, before anything
    reads the schema. This is what guarantees the fold runs: nothing on the render
    path parses view metadata through zod (the zod schemas serve the CLI
    validator, the VS Code extension and tests), so a `z.preprocess` on
    `ListViewSchema` — spec-side or local — would never execute.
  - **Producers emit `columns`**: `ObjectView`'s `renderListView` payload,
    `ObjectDataPage`, `InterfaceListPage` and the `list-view` registry defaults
    had been _downgrading_ already-canonical `columns` config back to `fields`.

  Two latent inconsistencies go away with it: the filter builder's
  objectDef-not-loaded fallback now resolves `ListColumn.field` (it read only
  `name`/`fieldName`, so object-form columns produced unnamed filter entries), and
  the column list no longer depends on which of the two keys a host happened to
  emit.

  `fields` stays declared on `ListViewSchema` and in the drift guard's sanctioned
  set — it is still valid input, and `@objectstack/spec`'s `react-blocks.ts`
  sanctions it as the React-tier `<ListView fields>` prop — but it is input-only.

- f1abf0e: fix(views): ListView reads the spec-canonical `filter`, so a view's base filter reaches every visualization (#2890 scope A step 4)

  Third rename in the ListView vocabulary migration: **`filters` → `filter`**. Unlike
  the first two this closes a live bug, because the fork was asymmetric.

  `ListView` was the **only** surface in the repo reading `filters`. Every child
  view — `ObjectGrid`, `ObjectGallery`, `ObjectKanban`, `ObjectCalendar`,
  `ObjectGantt`, `ObjectMap`, `ObjectTree`, `ObjectChart` — reads `filter`, and
  `ListView` handed them `filters`. Wherever a child fetches its own rows instead
  of receiving `ListView`'s, the view's base filter was silently dropped:

  - **a `chart` list view aggregated the whole object.** The chart branch built an
    `object-chart` node with `filters:`; `ObjectChart` reads `schema.filter` and
    never read `filters`, so a chart view with a base filter charted unfiltered
    totals.
  - the same applied to any of the other view components rendered standalone from
    a list-view-shaped config.

  Conversely, a **spec-authored** list view — one carrying `filter`, which is what
  the spec says and what `runtime-metadata-persistence` and "Save as view" already
  persist — rendered **unfiltered** in `ListView`, because nothing read that key.

  The fold is a key rename only. Both keys carry an ObjectQL FilterNode array
  everywhere in objectui; every consumer passes the value straight to `$filter`.
  (The spec types `filter` as `ViewFilterRule[]` — `{field, operator, value}`
  objects — so objectui's field is typed from the spec but used as something else.
  That mismatch is real and left alone here: converting formats inside a
  vocabulary fold would change what reaches the data source.)

  Also collapses a duplicated computation in `app-shell`'s `ObjectView`, which
  computed the same effective filter **twice** — once as `filter` for the child
  views, once as `filters` for `ListView` — with the two copies subtly different
  (only one fell back to `listSchema.filter`; only the other ran token
  substitution over the URL filters). There is now one computation, keeping both
  behaviors.

  `filters` stays declared on `ListViewSchema` and in the drift guard's sanctioned
  set — stored views carry it and it is still valid input — but it is input-only.

- f05b84e: refactor(views): ListView resolves density from the spec-canonical `rowHeight` (#2890 scope A step 2)

  Second rename in the ListView vocabulary migration: **`densityMode` → `rowHeight`**,
  folded in the same `normalizeListViewSchema` that step 1 introduced.

  Unlike `fields`/`columns` this is not a pure alias — the two vocabularies are
  different sizes. The spec has five row heights (`compact`/`short`/`medium`/
  `tall`/`extra_tall`); ListView's toolbar offers three densities
  (`compact`/`comfortable`/`spacious`). Both directions now live in one place as
  `DENSITY_MODE_TO_ROW_HEIGHT` / `ROW_HEIGHT_TO_DENSITY_MODE`, chosen so a fold
  followed by a read is a round trip (`spacious` → `tall` → `spacious`), with the
  narrowing collapse (`short` → `compact`, `extra_tall` → `spacious`) stated once
  instead of being re-derived per call site.

  Two behavior fixes fall out of it:

  - **Precedence is no longer inverted.** `ListView` read `densityMode` _first_, so
    a view carrying both keys rendered the legacy value — backwards from every
    other legacy/canonical pair in the schema. The canonical key now wins.
  - **The toolbar stops re-seeding the legacy key.** `ObjectView`'s
    `onDensityChange` persisted `densityMode` into stored view metadata on every
    density toggle, so the legacy vocabulary kept regrowing underneath the
    migration. It persists `rowHeight` now.

  `densityMode` stays declared on `ListViewSchema` and in the drift guard's
  sanctioned set — stored views carry it and it is still valid input — but it is
  input-only.

### Patch Changes

- 7b35e4b: fix(dashboard,charts): resolve `{current_user_id}` in widget filters (framework #3574)

  A dashboard widget filtered on `{current_user_id}` rendered `0`. The token
  reached SQL as a literal, matched no row, and nothing was logged on the client
  or the server — a silent zero that reads as "you have no work" rather than
  "this filter did not resolve". The same token in a list-view filter resolved
  correctly, so a user-scoped list and a user-scoped widget over the same data
  disagreed.

  There was no shared resolver. Three ad-hoc implementations had grown up
  independently — `ObjectView` for list views, `ObjectDataPage` for URL filter
  triples, `NavigationRenderer` for hrefs — and each understood only the filter
  shape its own surface used. `ObjectView`'s opened with
  `if (!Array.isArray(filter)) return filter`, so it could not have been reused
  by dashboard widgets even in principle: widget filters are MongoDB-style
  objects. Widgets therefore got no resolution at all — `DatasetWidget` called
  `resolveDateMacros` and nothing else, which is why `{today}` worked in a widget
  and `{current_user_id}` silently did not.

  - **`@object-ui/core`** — new `utils/filter-tokens.ts` with
    `resolveContextTokens` and `resolveFilterPlaceholders`. The latter expands
    _every_ placeholder vocabulary in one call and is what surfaces should use;
    resolving only some of them is the whole defect. The walk handles arrays and
    plain objects uniformly, so one resolver covers both platform filter shapes.
  - **`@object-ui/react`** — new `FilterScopeProvider` / `useFilterScope`. The
    renderer packages deliberately do not depend on `@object-ui/auth`, so the
    shell supplies the session values. This is a separate context from
    `PredicateScopeContext`, which is the expression evaluation scope and carries
    no organization.
  - **`@object-ui/plugin-dashboard` / `@object-ui/plugin-charts`** — all six
    widgets that previously resolved date macros only now resolve both
    vocabularies: `DatasetWidget`, `ObjectMetricWidget`, `ObjectDataTable`,
    `ObjectPivotTable`, and `ObjectChart` (dataset-bound and inline paths). The
    chart's `compareTo` comparison filter gets the session pass too — otherwise
    the overlay series silently ignored the owner clause the primary series
    honoured.
  - **`@object-ui/app-shell`** — `ObjectView`'s local `substituteFilterTokens`
    and `ObjectDataPage`'s inline `=== '{current_user_id}'` ternary now delegate
    to the shared resolver, so both also gain `{current_org_id}` and date macros.
    Two of the three ad-hoc implementations are gone rather than joined by a
    fourth.

  An unresolvable token is left intact rather than dropped: leaving it yields an
  empty result, whereas dropping the clause would _widen_ the result set and show
  a signed-out viewer everyone's data. It is no longer silent — the resolver
  warns, naming the token, and suggests the intended spelling for known
  near-misses (`{current_user}`, `{user_id}`, `{organization_id}`). Authoring-time
  enforcement lands separately as `filter-token-unknown` in `@objectstack/lint`.

- e16ed2d: fix(dashboard,charts): send widget `dateGranularity`/`sortBy`/`limit` to the query, and give funnels a real stage order (framework#3588)

  `DatasetWidget` never read `widget.options`. Four keys an author writes there
  change the query the server compiles, so a widget declaring
  `options: { dateGranularity: 'month' }` grouped by the raw timestamp and drew
  one bar per record, and `sortBy`/`sortOrder` produced no ordering at all.

  - `DatasetWidget` lowers `options.dateGranularity`, `options.sortBy` +
    `options.sortOrder`, and `options.limit` into the `DatasetSelection` it posts.
    A `sortBy` naming something the widget does not project is dropped rather than
    sent, so a stale sort key left by an edit degrades to "unordered" instead of
    failing the widget against the server's stricter validation. These keys also
    join the refetch signature, so editing one in the designer refetches instead
    of re-rendering the previous grid.
  - Funnel stages follow a **declared order**. `AdvancedChartImpl` sorted funnel
    segments by value descending, unconditionally — which overrode any server
    ordering and rendered a sales pipeline as a tidy narrowing shape whatever the
    stages' real sequence, hiding the very anomaly (a bulge at Proposal) the chart
    exists to show. It now honours a `categoryOrder`, which `DatasetWidget`
    derives from the dimension field's picklist option order — the pipeline order
    an author already declared on the object — or from an explicit
    `options.stageOrder`. With no declared order the value-descending default is
    unchanged, and a category missing from the order is kept (after the declared
    ones), never dropped.
  - New `@object-ui/core` helpers `buildCategoryOrder` / `buildCategoryRank`,
    keyed by both the stored value and the display label like the existing
    `buildOptionColorMap`, so ordering works whether or not the server resolved
    the dimension's labels.

  Requires the framework-side fix in objectstack#3588 for the selection keys to
  take effect server-side.

- 53642d4: fix(core,fields): a string `$orderby` is a clause, not a character array — and localize the sharing-rule widgets (objectstack#3821)

  **The recipient picker listed nothing, ever.** `QueryParams['$orderby']` was
  typed as `Record | string[] | SortObject[]`, so `queryParamsToRecord` sent any
  non-array value through `Object.entries`. Handed the clause string `'name asc'`
  — which callers do build by hand — it walked the string index by index and
  emitted `$orderby=0 n,1 a,2 m,3 e,4 ,5 a,6 s,7 c`. The server sorted by columns
  that don't exist and every row was filtered out, so
  `sys_sharing_rule.recipient_id` rendered "No matches" for every recipient type
  and no sharing rule could be created from the Console. `ObjectGrid` builds the
  same shape from a schema-level `sort` in three places, so grids with a string
  sort silently showed an empty table.

  A string `$orderby` is now passed through verbatim (the server's OData
  normalizer has always parsed `'name asc'`), and the type admits `string`.
  `RecipientPickerField` additionally switched to the structured
  `{ name: 'asc' }` form so it can't regress this way against any data source.

  **The three sharing-rule authoring widgets never had translations.**
  `ObjectRefField`, `RecipientPickerField` and `FilterConditionField` hardcoded
  their English copy — a Chinese Console showed "Select an object", "Select a
  user", "Search…", "No matches", "Edit as JSON". They now go through
  `useFieldTranslation` like every other widget, with keys added under `fields.*`
  in all ten locales.

  The recipient placeholder was the interesting one: it read
  `` `Select a ${recipientType.replace(/_/g,' ')}` ``, interpolating the enum
  value into an English sentence — a shape no locale can translate. It is now a
  per-type key (`fields.recipient.selectUser`, `…selectBusinessUnit`, …), so
  "选择业务单元" and "Select a business unit" no longer have to share a structure.

  **Editing a rule silently dropped its recipient.** The picker resets the stored
  id when `recipient_type` changes, because an id valid for a user is meaningless
  for a team. It treated the edit form's `'' → 'user'` hydration as such a change:
  opening any saved rule blanked the recipient, and saving persisted the blank.
  Only a non-empty predecessor now counts as a type switch.

  **Building a filter submitted the surrounding form.** None of `FilterBuilder`'s
  controls declared `type="button"`, and a bare `<button>` inside a `<form>`
  defaults to `type="submit"`. Adding, removing or clearing a condition therefore
  submitted the sharing-rule dialog — firing validation mid-edit, and on an
  already-valid form saving the record before the admin was done.

  **A rejected write showed the user raw server diagnostics.** The form rendered
  `error.message` verbatim, so a sharing / RLS denial reached the dialog and the
  toast as `FORBIDDEN: insufficient privileges to update showcase_private_note
pi-TgoJ4_DM55Fqz` — untranslated, and leaking the object's machine name and the
  record id to whoever hit it. Permission failures now render localized copy
  (`form.noPermissionToSave`, added in all ten locales), with the server text kept
  on the console for debugging; other failures still show the server's message,
  which is the useful part, and fall back to `form.submitFailed` when there is
  none — replacing the previously hardcoded English "An error occurred during
  submission".

  **The detail header offered "Edit" on records the user may only read.** Object
  permissions can't express "this one record is read-only" — a read-only sharing
  grant sits inside an object the user may otherwise edit — so the header showed
  the primary Edit CTA, opened the form, and let the user retype a field before
  the server rejected the save. `DetailView` now gates Edit / Delete on the
  object-level check AND on the explain engine's record-grained verdict
  (`POST /api/v1/security/explain` with a `recordId`, ADR-0090 D6 / ADR-0095 C2 —
  the same pipeline the enforcement middleware runs, so button and server cannot
  disagree). Explaining oneself needs no special permission. The probe is one
  cached request per record, skipped entirely when the object-level check already
  says no, and **fails open** on every uncertainty — an unanswered hint must never
  be the reason a permitted user cannot act; the server stays the authority
  (ADR-0057 D10).

  **A long option rendered straight past the combobox border.** `Combobox`'s
  trigger pinned itself to the component's `w-[200px]` default while the fields
  around it ran the full form column, and the selected label was a bare text child
  of a flex button — flex items need `truncate` AND `min-w-0` to clip, and it had
  neither. So "成员 (showcase_project_membership)" in the object picker overflowed
  the control and collided with the field beside it. The label now truncates, the
  trigger can shrink, the dropdown matches the trigger's width instead of a
  hardcoded 200px (a widened combobox used to clip its own options), and the two
  sharing-rule pickers ask for `w-full` so they line up with every other input.

  Hardens `evaluatePermission` while there: a role config carrying only
  `fieldPermissions` (no `actions`) made `check()` throw a TypeError that
  propagated out of the render. A permission check must not be able to crash a
  view.

  Browser-verified against the framework showcase Console in Chinese: object /
  criteria / recipient copy is fully localized, the recipient dropdown lists real
  users, business units and positions, a saved rule reopens with its recipient and
  criteria intact, editing the filter no longer submits, and a rule created
  end-to-end stores a real record id rather than free text. The criteria authored
  in the builder is honored by the evaluator: `{"pinned":true}` on an owner-private
  object granted the recipient exactly the matching records and nothing else.

### Minor Changes

- 1c8935a: feat(app-shell): render ActionParamDialog params through the shared form field-widget renderer (ADR-0059, #2700)

  `ActionParamDialog` no longer hand-rolls a per-type ternary chain (select /
  lookup / textarea / number / boolean, everything else → text input). Every
  declared action param now renders through the same `fieldWidgetMap` the object
  form uses, so a param of ANY form-supported field type — `file`, `image`,
  `richtext`, `markdown`, `color`, `address`, `code`, `date`, … — gets its real
  widget, lazily loaded behind `Suspense`. Subsumes the single `file` branch ask
  in #2698: `type: 'file'` params render the real `FileField` upload control via
  the ambient `UploadProvider`, honoring `multiple`/`accept`/`maxSize`.

  - `@object-ui/fields`: new exports `resolveFormWidgetType(type)` (widget-key
    resolution incl. spec aliases, text fallback) and `getLazyFieldWidget(type)`
    (per-type-cached `React.lazy` over the form's own widget loaders).
  - `@object-ui/core`: `ActionParamDef` gains `accept`/`maxSize`; `multiple` is
    now general widget config (was lookup-only).
  - `@object-ui/app-shell`: new pure `paramToField()` adapter (param → field
    shape) with a drift test pinning param support ⊇ form support (`FORM_FIELD_TYPES`),
    mirroring the FieldEditWidget parity guard; `resolveActionParams()` inherits
    `multiple`/`accept`/`maxSize` from the referenced field for every type.
    `required` validation, `visible` CEL gating, helpText, error styling, and
    value shapes for previously-supported types are unchanged.

- 2e7d7f0: feat(evaluator): route `{ dialect: 'cel' }` component/action predicates to the canonical CEL engine (#2661)

  Component and action `visible` / `disabled` / `hidden` predicates were evaluated
  by the home-grown JS `ExpressionEvaluator`, while field rules
  (`visibleWhen`/`readonlyWhen`/`requiredWhen`, via `fieldRules.ts`) and row/list
  conditionals (via `evalRowPredicate`) already delegate to the canonical
  `@objectstack/formula` engine. That split meant a `{ dialect: 'cel' }` predicate
  in a renderer/action surface was executed as **JavaScript** — CEL-only forms
  (`x in list`, `has()`, typed `==`, the `today()`/`daysFromNow()` catalog) behaved
  differently from, or faulted against, the server's enforcement.

  This converges the remaining tier onto the same engine:

  - **`@object-ui/core`** — `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluateCondition` now detects a
    `{ dialect: 'cel', source }` envelope and evaluates it on `@objectstack/formula`
    (via `evalFieldPredicate`), binding the `record` namespace plus the whole
    context bag as top-level scope (`record.*`, `features.*`, `user.*`, `app.*`).
    Fail-soft to visible/enabled to match the legacy default; `throwOnError`
    callers still fail closed on a _faulting_ predicate (a genuine `false` never
    throws). This fixes every `SchemaRenderer` visibility/disabled read at once.
  - **`@object-ui/react`** — `toPredicateInput` preserves a CEL envelope instead of
    collapsing it to a `${source}` string, and `useCondition` accepts and forwards
    the envelope (keyed on a stable `(dialect, source)` so it doesn't re-evaluate
    each render). Action buttons (`action-icon`/`group`/`bar`/`button`) therefore
    evaluate CEL `visible`/`enabled`/`disabled` on the canonical engine.

  **Back-compat:** bare strings and `${…}` templates stay on the legacy JS path
  (deprecation window); only an explicit `{ dialect: 'cel' }` envelope is rerouted.
  `{ dialect: 'template' }` is unaffected.

  Together with the `^15.1.1` alignment (#2662), a renderer CEL predicate now
  reaches the identical verdict as the server — including the framework's
  `dateField == today()` equality fix (objectstack-ai/objectstack#3205) once it
  lands in a published 15.x. The broader home-grown-vs-canonical divergence
  motivation is #2661.

- 31b77d4: **Add the explicit `engine-owned` lifecycle bucket (tracks framework ADR-0103 addendum / #3343).** The framework split the overloaded `managedBy: 'system'` bucket by promoting the engine-owned case to its own enum value; this mirrors it in the UI type + runtime + badge.

  - **`@object-ui/types`** — `ManagedByBucket` union and `MANAGED_BY_BUCKETS` gain `'engine-owned'` (canonical order: `platform, config, system, engine-owned, append-only, better-auth`). The union stays closed, so every consumer that missed the new value is a compile error.
  - **`@object-ui/core`** — `resolveCrudAffordances` gains the `engine-owned` default row (identical all-locked matrix as `system`/`append-only`), so `isObjectInlineEditable` / the grid + form gates treat it as read-only automatically.
  - **`@object-ui/app-shell`** — the `ManagedByBadge` renders `engine-owned` with the same read-only "System-managed" copy as a locked `system` object (reuses the existing `managedByBadge.system` i18n key — zero translation churn; the distinction is at the schema level, not the user-facing string), and `resolveManagedByEmptyState` reuses the `system` engine-owned empty state.

  Behaviour-preserving: `engine-owned` resolves to the same locked affordances `system` did by default, so nothing about how a locked object renders changes — the value just makes the schema self-documenting. New unit coverage for the bucket in `resolveCrudAffordances` / `isObjectInlineEditable` / `MANAGED_BY_BUCKETS` / the empty-state helper.

- 62b9ab5: feat(data): unify master-detail saves behind `DataSource.batchTransaction`, isolate the non-atomic fallback in the adapter (#2679)

  Master-detail saves (`MasterDetailForm`, `LineItemsPanel`) now always persist
  through `dataSource.batchTransaction(operations)` — one ordered cross-object
  operation list, with `{ $ref: <op index> }` linking a child to a parent created
  in the same batch. The form no longer contains any client-side orchestration or
  best-effort compensation-delete; that atomicity anti-pattern is gone from the UI
  layer (framework #1604 / framework ADR-0034 item 4).

  - **`@object-ui/types`** — `batchTransaction?` is now a first-class (optional)
    method on the `DataSource` contract, typed via `BatchTransactionOperation` /
    `BatchRef`. Replaces the previous `(dataSource as any).batchTransaction`
    method-sniffing.
  - **`@object-ui/core`** — new `emulateBatchTransaction(dataSource, operations)`
    (sequential writes, `$ref` resolution, best-effort reverse-order compensation)
    and `runBatchTransaction(dataSource, operations)` (prefers the adapter's method,
    emulates otherwise). `ApiDataSource` / `ValueDataSource` implement
    `batchTransaction` via the emulation.
  - **`@object-ui/data-objectstack`** — `ObjectStackAdapter.batchTransaction` uses
    the server's atomic `POST /api/v1/batch`, prefers the typed
    `client.data.batchTransaction` SDK method when the installed client exposes it,
    and degrades to the client-side emulation ONLY when the endpoint is missing
    (404/405) or the runtime can't do transactions (501). Real errors (400/401/403/
    409/500) still surface. This is the isolated, tested home of the non-atomic
    fallback.
  - **`@object-ui/plugin-form`** — removed `applyDetail` / `createMany` /
    `ApplyDetailResult` from `masterDetailTx.ts`; `MasterDetailForm` and
    `LineItemsPanel` build ops and call `runBatchTransaction`. `LineItemsPanel`
    saves are now atomic on a capable backend, with the rollup folded into the same
    batch.

  No behavior change on a current ObjectStack backend (it has `/api/v1/batch`);
  older/limited backends keep a working — now clearly non-atomic — save path.

- 1629313: feat(fields): RadioField per-option `visibleWhen` cascading + `dependsOn` gating; single-source the option resolver

  Brings `RadioField` to parity with `SelectField` / `MultiSelectField` for ADR-0058
  cascading & role-gated options, and collapses the three copies of the
  gate-then-filter logic onto one shared resolver.

  - **`@object-ui/core`**: new pure `resolveCascadingOptions(rawOptions, record, dependsOn, scope)`
    → `{ options, gated, dependsOnFields }` — the single source of truth for
    `dependsOn` gating + per-option `visibleWhen` filtering.
  - **`@object-ui/fields`**: `RadioField` now narrows its offered radios against
    the live record + `current_user`, gates behind a "select the parent first"
    hint while a `dependsOn` field is empty, and clears a value no longer offered
    (scalar cascade clear). The `useCascadingOptions` hook is refactored to a thin
    React wrapper over `resolveCascadingOptions`.
  - **`@object-ui/components`**: the form renderer's inline option pre-filter and
    cross-field cascade-clear effect now call `resolveCascadingOptions` instead of
    re-deriving gating/filtering, so they can't drift from the widgets (no
    behavior change).
  - Tests: `RadioField.cascade.test.tsx` mirrors the select cascade tests; core
    gains `resolveCascadingOptions` unit coverage.

- 2331ac9: feat(report): drill a date-bucket cell into its time range, not a superset (#1752)

  Clicking a report/dashboard cell grouped by a `dateGranularity` date dimension
  ("2026-Q2") used to drill into a **superset** — the date dimension was skipped,
  so the record list spanned every time bucket. It now scopes to the clicked
  bucket's half-open range, consuming the framework's new `drillRanges` sidecar.

  - **`@object-ui/core`** — `buildDatasetDrillFilter` accepts the per-row
    `drillRanges` and emits an ObjectQL range operator object
    (`{ [field]: { $gte, $lt } }`) alongside the equality dims.
  - **`@object-ui/plugin-report` / `@object-ui/plugin-dashboard`** — the report
    renderer and dashboard widget forward `drillRanges`, and a **date-only**
    report (no equality drill dim) is now drillable via the range alone.
  - **`@object-ui/app-shell`** — the "Open in list →" escape hatch
    (`useOpenRecordList`) now targets the ADR-0055 **bare data surface**
    (`/:object/data`, "the URL is the view" — no baked-in view filter to
    over-narrow the drill) and serializes a range to the
    `filter[field][gte|lt]` operator contract. `ObjectDataPage` parses those
    operators (equality shorthand unchanged), renders a range as a single chip,
    and removes both bounds together. A new `drillUrlFilters` module owns the
    write/read serialization so both sides can't drift (round-trip tested).

  Companion to the framework analytics change (objectstack-ai/objectstack#3256).

### Patch Changes

- 8b8b744: chore(deps): align `@objectstack/formula` / `lint` / `client` to `^15.1.1`

  These three were still pinned to `^14.6.0` while `@objectstack/spec` was already
  `^15.1.1` — a version skew from the v15 upgrade (formula/lint/client publish in
  lockstep with spec, and their own 15.0.0 entries are pure dependency bumps, so
  this is alignment, not a behavioral migration).

  Practical effect: the client-side field-rule evaluation
  (`visibleWhen`/`readonlyWhen`/`requiredWhen` via `fieldRules.ts`, which delegates
  to `@objectstack/formula`'s `ExpressionEngine`) now tracks the 15.x engine — and
  will pick up the framework's `dateField == today()` equality fix
  (objectstack-ai/objectstack#3205) automatically at the next 15.x release via the
  caret range. Renderer/action `visible`/`disabled` predicates are unaffected (they
  use the home-grown JS evaluator — tracked separately in #2661).

- 7cf4051: chore(deps): align every `@objectstack/*` dependency to `^16.0.0-rc.0`

  Bumps `@objectstack/spec` / `client` / `formula` / `lint` from `^15.1.1` to the
  `16.0.0-rc.0` pre-release across the workspace (root + `apps/console` +
  `apps/site` + all consuming packages). ObjectUI's own packages are already on
  major 16, so this closes the 15↔16 skew between ObjectUI and the `@objectstack`
  contract libraries (which publish in lockstep with `spec`).

  This is a dependency alignment, not a behavioral migration: the full workspace
  build (43/43) and the `@objectstack`-consuming package test suites
  (`core` / `app-shell` / `data-objectstack` / `plugin-form` / `types`) are green
  against `16.0.0-rc.0` with no source changes required.

  Practical effect: `@objectstack/client@16.0.0-rc.0` now ships
  `data.batchTransaction` (framework #3271), so `ObjectStackAdapter`'s feature
  detect (`typeof client.data.batchTransaction === 'function'`) routes
  master-detail cross-object saves through the typed SDK method instead of the
  raw `fetch('/api/v1/batch')` fallback — realizing the "verify SDK path" half of
  #2694. The raw-fetch branch stays as a defensive fallback (removal tracked in
  #2694).

- 6d4fbe6: **Consolidate the `managedBy` lifecycle-bucket logic into one shared source of truth (follows framework ADR-0103).** The bucket taxonomy was hand-mirrored in several places — `crudAffordances.ts`, `ManagedByBadge.tsx` (its own `Bucket` union + `isWriteOptedIn` + the writable-system derivation), and `plugin-detail`'s `record-details.tsx` (`NON_EDITABLE_BUCKETS`, duplicated because it can't depend on app-shell) — a drift risk, and the object-schema `managedBy` type was open-ended (`(string & {})`) so unknown buckets slipped through and silently defaulted to fully-editable.

  - **`@object-ui/types`** now owns the closed `ManagedByBucket` union (+ `MANAGED_BY_BUCKETS`), and `ObjectSchema.managedBy` is tightened from `'platform' | 'better-auth' | (string & {})` to that union — unknown buckets are now a type error at authoring time.
  - **`@object-ui/core`** now owns the React-free runtime logic — `resolveCrudAffordances`, `isWriteOptedIn`, `isSystemWritable`, `isObjectInlineEditable` — reachable by every UI package including `plugin-detail` (which could not import app-shell).
  - **`app-shell/utils/crudAffordances.ts`** is now a thin re-export of `@object-ui/core` (existing imports keep working); `ManagedByBadge` consumes the shared `isSystemWritable`; `plugin-detail` `record-details.tsx` replaces its hand-mirrored `NON_EDITABLE_BUCKETS` with `isObjectInlineEditable`.

  Behavior-preserving — all existing affordance/edit-gate tests stay green; the shared module adds direct unit coverage (including the previously-untested `isSystemWritable` derivation). Translated copy (badge variants, empty-state messages) stays in app-shell.

- 0a3710b: **Finish the `managedBy` / `userActions` de-dup — one parser for the override shape (completes objectui#2712, framework#3343).** #2712 consolidated the bucket _union_ + affordance _set_ mirrors but left four surfaces still parsing the `userActions.{create,edit,delete}` override shape by hand. They now all route through the shared `@object-ui/core` policy, so no package re-implements the boolean / #2614-object-form parse locally.

  - **`@object-ui/core`** promotes the internal `normalizeOverride` to the exported **`normalizeUserAction(v, base)`** (the one parser) and adds **`userActionPredicates(v)`** for per-record CEL predicate extraction.
  - **`app-shell/utils/managedByEmptyState.ts`** — the writable-`system` create check and its local `EmptyStateUserActions` interface are replaced by `resolveCrudAffordances({ managedBy, userActions }).create`.
  - **`plugin-grid/rowCrudAffordances.ts`** — the local `isOptedOut` / `predicatesOf` helpers (and duplicated `RowCrudUserAction` / `RowCrudPredicates` types) fold into `normalizeUserAction`; the historical type names stay re-exported for compat.
  - **`plugin-detail/RelatedList.tsx`** — its inline `predicatesOf` fold into `userActionPredicates`.
  - **`plugin-form/ObjectForm.tsx`** — the hand-rolled `managedBy !== 'platform'` blanket lock + `userActions` unlock is replaced by the resolved affordance for the current mode (`edit` / `create`), the **same** `resolveCrudAffordances` contract the detail (`isObjectInlineEditable`) and grid surfaces use.

  Behavior-preserving for `platform` / `system` / `append-only` / `better-auth`, with one deliberate alignment: an admin-editable **`config`**-bucket object (e.g. `sys_webhook`, `sys_permission_set`) is now editable in `ObjectForm` — it was previously over-locked as "non-`platform`", while detail/grid already treated it as editable (`config` resolves `edit: true`). New unit coverage for the shared parser and the config / create-mode form gate; all existing affordance/edit-gate tests stay green.

- eee4ded: feat(fields): render `select` + `multiple` through the multi-value chip picker; restore fields/core lint gates

  - **Multi-value select** — a `select` field/param declared `multiple: true`
    now renders the multi-value chip picker (the `multiselect` widget) and stores
    a `string[]`, instead of collapsing to a single-value dropdown that could
    hold only one value. The delegation lives inside `SelectField`, so the object
    form, the inline grid editor, and the app-shell `ActionParamDialog` all
    inherit it from the one `select` widget with no per-surface drift. Single
    selects keep the cascading dropdown (multi + per-option `visibleWhen`
    cascading is not a combination in use today).
  - **`autonumber` mapping is unchanged** here; this change is orthogonal.
  - **Lint gates restored** — fixed the pre-existing baseline lint errors that
    had left the `@object-ui/fields` and `@object-ui/core` package lints red (so
    the gate could not catch new violations): `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` in
    `ImageField` / `TextAreaField` / `index.tsx` (hooks hoisted above early
    returns; the `useFieldTranslate` hook no longer wrapped in try/catch), plus
    `no-useless-assignment` / `no-useless-escape` / `no-control-regex` /
    `prefer-const` / `preserve-caught-error` in the core evaluator and utils. No
    behavior change from the lint fixes.

### Minor Changes

- 0890fa7: feat(core): build-time guardrail for cascading select option predicates (#1583)

  `@object-ui/core` now exports `lintOptionPredicates(fields)` — a static,
  conservative validator for the per-option `visibleWhen` CEL predicates that
  drive cascading / role-gated `select` options (#2284). An option predicate fails
  _closed_ — a wrong one makes its option silently never appear — so this catches
  the class of bug runtime fail-open can't surface:

  - `syntax` — invalid CEL, delegated to `@objectstack/formula`'s
    `validateExpression` (no schema hint, so a legitimate `current_user.roles`
    reference is never mistaken for an error);
  - `unknown-field` — a `record.<name>` reference to a field the form never
    declares (a sibling typo);
  - `option-literal-not-in-domain` — a literal compared against an _enum_ sibling
    that is outside its declared option values, e.g. `record.country == 'chna'`
    when `country` is `cn`/`us` (the AI-authoring typo #2284 called out).

  It only flags what it can statically prove — non-`record.` roots
  (`current_user.*`), open-domain fields, and unrecognized shapes are left alone,
  so there are no false positives. The schema catalog runs it over every shipped
  example. Design recorded in ADR-0058.

- 5523fc4: Dashboard-level filters — the three #2578 item-5 enhancements (framework#2501):

  - **react**: nested `PageVariablesProvider`s now MERGE instead of shadowing
    wholesale. A filtered dashboard embedded in a Page with its own `variables`
    keeps the outer page variables readable inside widget subtrees (`page.*`);
    an inner definition shadows only the SAME name; writes route to the scope
    that defines the variable (writing an outer-defined name from inside the
    nested subtree updates the outer provider); `resetVariables` stays local.
    Names defined nowhere still write locally, exactly as before.
  - **core**: `buildWidgetScopedFilter` accepts an optional `knownFields` set —
    a DEFAULT binding whose target field is not on the widget's object is
    skipped with a console warning instead of emitting a query the backend
    empty-matches. Explicit `filterBindings` strings are always honoured (a
    typo surfaces as a visibly empty widget, never a silently dropped filter).
    Omitting `knownFields` preserves the previous unchecked behaviour.
  - **plugin-dashboard**: `DashboardRenderer` feeds `knownFields` from
    `dataSource.getObjectSchema` for inline `object` widgets (best-effort —
    unchecked while metadata loads or when the source can't describe objects).
    `optionsFrom` dynamic filter options now resolve DISTINCT values
    server-side via a dataset GROUP BY (`queryDataset` with an inline draft)
    when the data source supports it, falling back to the previous client-side
    top-200 dedupe otherwise.

- 887062c: feat(dashboard): dashboard-level filters (date / region) driving multiple charts (framework#2501)

  A dashboard's `dateRange` + `globalFilters` declarations are now wired end to
  end: the filter values live as dashboard-level variables (the page variables
  primitive, so they're also readable as `page.<name>` in widget expressions),
  a filter bar renders above the widgets, and at render time the dashboard
  broadcasts the active values into every bound widget's inline query —
  `AND`-merged with the widget's own `filter`. Charts stay inline and
  self-contained; each widget maps a filter to **its own** field.

  - **`@object-ui/types`** — `globalFilters[].name` (stable filter/variable key,
    defaults to `field`) and `DashboardWidgetSchema.filterBindings`
    (`Record<string, string | false>`: per-widget field override / `false`
    opt-out). Zod mirrors included. **Pending paired `@objectstack/spec`
    alignment (framework#2501)** — same precedent as `dataset` /
    `categoryGranularity`.
  - **`@object-ui/core`** — new pure `dashboard-filters` module
    (`resolveDashboardFilterDefs`, `dashboardFilterVariableDefs`,
    `buildFilterCondition`, `buildWidgetScopedFilter`); `mergeFilters` lifted
    from plugin-report (re-exported there unchanged). Date presets emit
    date-macro tokens (`{30_days_ago}` …) so widgets resolve them at query time
    like hand-authored filters.
  - **`@object-ui/plugin-dashboard`** — `DashboardFilterBar` (date presets +
    custom range calendar, select with static `options` or `optionsFrom`,
    text/number inputs, reset); `DashboardRenderer` mounts a
    `PageVariablesProvider` when filters are declared and merges the
    widget-scoped condition into inline widgets' `filter` and dataset widgets'
    `runtimeFilter`. Dashboards without filters render exactly as before.

  Binding precedence: explicit `filterBindings` string/`false` → legacy
  `targetWidgets` allow-list → the filter's own `field` (dateRange defaults to
  `created_at`). Static-data widgets are not filtered.

- dea65f7: Unify the list-view conditional tier onto the canonical CEL engine (#1584).

  Conditional formatting (list / grid / kanban) and row-action `visible` /
  `disabled` predicates are now evaluated by `@objectstack/formula`'s
  `ExpressionEngine` — the same engine the server uses — instead of the legacy
  JS-dialect `ExpressionEvaluator`, matching how `@objectstack/spec` already types
  these surfaces (`ExpressionInputSchema` / CEL). The whole platform now speaks one
  expression dialect (framework ADR-0058).

  - `@object-ui/core`: new `evalRowPredicate` + `resolveConditionalFormatting`
    helpers (next to `evalFieldPredicate`). One implementation of all three
    formatting rule shapes; dialect routing (a `{ dialect: 'cel' }` envelope is
    always CEL; a bare string is CEL unless it carries legacy-only syntax
    (`${…}` / `===` / `?.` / `.includes()`), which routes to the old engine with a
    one-time deprecation warning); the native `{ field, operator, value }` form is
    translated to CEL.
  - `@object-ui/react`: new `useRowPredicate` hook (canonical CEL, ambient
    predicate scope merged).
  - Consumers converged: `ListView.evaluateConditionalFormatting` (thin wrapper,
    export kept), `ObjectGrid` row styling (inline copy removed), kanban card
    styles, and the grid / data-table row-action menus. `plugin-view`'s kanban
    branch now forwards top-level `conditionalFormatting` (previously dropped).
  - Row-action `visible` fails **closed** (broken predicate → hidden + warn);
    `disabled` fails soft. The CEL `in` operator (and list membership) now work in
    row predicates — the legacy engine could not parse them.
  - The legacy `FormField.condition: { field, equals/notEquals/in }` is retired to
    a CEL translation (back-compat preserved); `FieldDesigner` migrated to
    `visibleWhen`.

  Fully back-compat: existing conditional-formatting rules, row-action predicates,
  and form `condition` metadata keep working (translated / routed as needed).

### Patch Changes

- 2ded18c: Fix: a dashboard filter declaring its static `options` in the
  `@objectstack/spec` object form (`options: [{ value, label }]` — the shape
  the spec validates and what framework-authored dashboards ship) crashed the
  whole dashboard with "Objects are not valid as a React child". Caught driving
  the showcase Revenue Pulse dashboard in a real browser.

  `resolveDashboardFilterDefs` now normalizes both the spec object form and the
  bare-string shorthand (`options: ['EMEA']`) to `{ value, label }` pairs —
  `DashboardFilterDef.options` is typed accordingly — and the filter bar's
  select renders labels (the trigger now shows the selected option's label, not
  its raw value). `@object-ui/types` aligns the `GlobalFilterSchema.options`
  shape with the spec union.

### Patch Changes

- 443360a: Action params support a `visible` CEL predicate — the param dialog omits a param
  when it evaluates false, against the same scope as action `visible` (features /
  user / app / data). Fixes the create-user form offering a **Phone Number** field
  the default backend rejects ("Phone numbers require the phoneNumber auth plugin"):
  paired with the framework gating that param on `features.phoneNumber`, the form
  now follows the plugin — no phone field unless the opt-in phoneNumber auth plugin
  is loaded. `filterVisibleParams` is exported + unit-tested (feature-off hides,
  feature-on shows, malformed predicate fails open).
- 05e56ca: 导出/导入模板的下载文件名与内容本地化。

  **导出文件名**:CSV/Excel/JSON 导出下载不再是 `<对象名>.<扩展名>`(如 `contracts.csv`),改为「对象显示名-视图名-时间戳.扩展名」(如 `任务-In Progress-20260714-153045.xlsx`);`exportOptions.fileNamePrefix` 配置仍优先(且作为完整前缀,不再追加视图名)。视图名与对象名重复时自动省略;`@object-ui/core` 新增 `buildExportFileName(ext, { prefix, label, objectName, viewLabel }, now?)` 与 `sanitizeFileNameBase(raw)`,ObjectGrid 与 ListView 的所有导出路径(服务端流式与前端兜底)统一走它。app-shell/plugin-view 的 ObjectView 现将当前视图的显示标签写进传给 ListView 的 schema(`label`),使导出文件名能区分同一对象的不同保存视图。

  **导入模板**:「下载模板」修复两处英文漏出——示例行的 select/多选取值改为优先取选项**显示标签**(如 `准备中`)而非 ASCII slug(`prepare`,服务端导入两者都接受);模板文件名本地化为 `{{object}}-导入模板.csv`(新增 i18n key `grid.import.templateFileName`,英文回退 `{{object}}-import-template.csv`)。

### Minor Changes

- 226fde9: Cascading & role-gated `select` options (#2284).

  `select` options now accept a per-option `visibleWhen` CEL predicate — the option
  is offered only when it evaluates TRUE against the live record **plus
  `current_user`** (same engine/env as a field-level `visibleWhen`). Combined with a
  field-level `dependsOn`, this drives dependent selects (country → province → city)
  and role/context gating with no bespoke matrix — the same primitives dependent
  lookups (#2215) already use.

  - `@object-ui/core` exposes `resolveVisibleOptions` / `isOptionGroupGated` /
    `resolveDependsOnFields` / `isValueStillOffered` (evaluator), reusing the
    canonical `evalFieldPredicate`.
  - The form renderer narrows a dependent select's option list, gates the control
    with a "Select {parent} first" hint while a `dependsOn` field is empty, and
    clears a now-invalid value when the parent changes.
  - The standalone `SelectField` widget applies the same resolution via
    `dependentValues` + the global predicate scope.

  Client-side hiding is UX, not authorization: gate authorization-sensitive option
  values on the server too. Aligns with `@objectstack/spec` `SelectOption.visibleWhen`.

### Minor Changes

- d23d6eb: Three-tier AI page authoring: `kind:'html'` and a trusted `kind:'react'` tier.

  - **`@object-ui/react-runtime`** (new) — the trusted runtime-React tier for
    `kind:'react'` pages (vendored react-runner: Sucrase transpile + scope-eval,
    no sandbox). Renders real JSX/TSX (any HTML + JS + hooks/useState/map/onClick)
    in the main React tree with an injected scope (React, the public data blocks,
    page data) and a built-in error boundary.
  - **`@object-ui/core`** — new runtime capability gate (`enableCapability` /
    `disableCapability` / `isCapabilityEnabled`, `CAP_REACT_PAGES`). `react-pages`
    defaults **ON** (the platform trusts reviewed, draft-gated authors); a
    deployment turns it OFF server-side (the runtime injects the disable global
    when `OS_DISABLE_REACT_PAGES` is set). Never controlled from authored metadata.
  - **`@object-ui/components`** — PageRenderer now routes `kind:'react'`
    (capability-gated, lazy-loads the runtime) and renders `kind:'html'` (the
    former `kind:'jsx'`, still accepted as a deprecated alias). The `html` tier
    now resolves the full safe native HTML tag set (h1–h6, p, a, ul/ol/li, img,
    blockquote, pre, strong/em, …) so authored HTML lives up to its name.

- 9e7a986: ADR-0080: AI-authored UI pages.

- 1311749: ADR-0080 M5: curated PUBLIC block contract (capability ≠ contract). Adds `PUBLIC_BLOCKS` — the single, reviewable list of ~36 object-aware + layout/content blocks that form the AI/contract surface (Salesforce-App-Builder-shaped). `getPublicConfigs()` now returns the curated set (plus any `tier:'public'` opt-in), keyed by bare tag and deduped across the registry's dual-key registrations. The full ~244 registered types remain a rendering capability.

- 08c47da: feat(dashboard): dataset chart widgets paint select/lookup dimensions in their option colors

  A dashboard `DatasetWidget` chart grouped by a select/lookup dimension (e.g.
  project `health`) painted its categories from the generic `--chart-1..5`
  palette — the same gap the chart view (`object-chart`) had before #1932. It now
  resolves the dimension field's option colors (using the dataset's base `object`

  - dimension→field map the query already returns) and threads them to the
    renderer as a per-category `categoryColors` map, so health green/red/yellow
    paints semantically.

  The value/label→color resolution is extracted into a shared `buildOptionColorMap`
  (`@object-ui/core`) now used by both `DatasetWidget` and `ObjectChart`.

### Minor Changes

- f7f325d: feat: action progress state + Undo affordance

  - **core**: `ActionResult.undo` (an `UndoableOperation`) and `ActionDef.undoable`.
    On success the `ActionRunner` pushes the operation onto the global UndoManager
    and the success toast carries an "Undo" affordance (`ToastHandler` gains an
    `undo` option).
  - **app-shell**: the console action runtime mounts `useGlobalUndo` (Ctrl+Z /
    Ctrl+Shift+Z) and renders the toast's "Undo" button; its `apiHandler` resolves
    the row id from the list row record and, for `undoable` actions, captures the
    changed fields' prior values so the update can be reverted.
  - **plugin-detail**: record-header quick-action buttons show a spinner + disable
    while the action runs (a visible progress state for slow/flow actions).

- c12986e: Add resultDialog + target interpolation for one-shot action reveals

  Some platform actions return values the user MUST copy now because the
  server will not surface them again — 2FA TOTP URI + backup codes, freshly
  minted OAuth client_secret, regenerated recovery codes. Previously these
  had to ship as bespoke pages in `apps/account` because actions only
  emitted a fire-and-forget toast.

  **`@object-ui/core` — ActionRunner**

  - New `ActionDef.resultDialog: ResultDialogSpec` field. When set on a
    successful action, the runner suppresses the `successMessage` toast and
    awaits the registered `ResultDialogHandler` instead. Missing handler is
    non-fatal (logs a warning); rejected handler is treated as acknowledged.
  - New `setResultDialogHandler(handler)` setter.
  - New types: `ResultDialogSpec`, `ResultDialogFieldSpec`,
    `ResultDialogHandler`.
  - `executeUrl` and `executeAPI` now run `${param.X}` and `${ctx.X}`
    interpolation against `target` before fetching / navigating. Values are
    `encodeURIComponent`'d, missing keys resolve to empty string. `ctx`
    exposes `origin`, `user`, `org`, `recordId` by default; consumers can
    inject more via `context.ctx`.

  **`@object-ui/react`**

  - `ActionProvider` and `useActionRunner` both gained an `onResultDialog`
    option that wires straight through to the runner.

  **`@object-ui/app-shell`**

  - New `ActionResultDialog` component — promise-based, blocks click-outside
    and Escape (the user MUST click acknowledge), renders five field
    formats: `qrcode` (client-side via the `qrcode` package — never sent
    off-device, so 2FA URIs stay secret), `code-list`, `secret`, `text`,
    `json`. Falls back to `json` when a value's shape doesn't match its
    declared format.
  - `ObjectView` and `RecordDetailView` install the handler and mount the
    dialog automatically, so any action with `resultDialog` declared in
    metadata now works without code changes.
  - New dependency: `qrcode@^1.5.x` for client-side QR rendering.

  Pairs with the framework-side `Action.resultDialog` schema added in
  `@objectstack/spec` and the `sys_two_factor` / `sys_oauth_application` /
  `sys_account` updates in `@objectstack/platform-objects`.

- 053c948: feat(app-shell): zero-roundtrip `newTabUrl` fast path for `opensInNewTab` actions

  Actions that declare `newTabUrl` (a path template with a `{recordId}` placeholder
  whose target endpoint performs all auth/authz itself) now drive the pre-opened
  popup straight to that URL on click, skipping the action POST entirely — applied
  to both server-action paths (list rows via `useConsoleActionRuntime`, record
  header via `RecordDetailView`). The popup paints the existing spinner page until
  the (possibly slow) endpoint commits its redirect; the URL is resolved absolute
  because `about:blank` gives a bare-relative href no reliable base. The
  popup-blocked toast fallback is unchanged. Removes one full round trip of
  white-screen latency from every such Open click.

- ddbe4a2: B2 step 3: client-side field-level conditional rules (`visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen`). The form renderer now evaluates these CEL predicates reactively against the live record and gates each field's visibility, read-only state, and required-ness accordingly. Evaluation delegates to the canonical `@objectstack/formula` `ExpressionEngine` — the _same_ dialect the server enforces (`requiredWhen` in the rule-validator, `readonlyWhen` in `stripReadonlyWhenFields`) — so the UX and the persisted verdict always agree. New core helpers `evalFieldPredicate` / `resolveFieldRuleState` (zero-React, fail-open). `FormField` gains `visibleWhen` / `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` (+ deprecated `conditionalRequired` alias), and `ObjectForm` carries them through from object metadata.
- d54346c: feat: action/flow completion messaging

  - **core**: `ActionResult.silent` — a handler sets it when the action only
    HANDED OFF to a follow-up UI (rather than completing), so `ActionRunner`
    skips the automatic success toast. Fixes the misleading "Action completed
    successfully" toast that fired the moment a `flow` action opened its wizard.
  - **app-shell**: both flow handlers now return `silent: true` when the flow
    pauses at a screen (the wizard only opened — it hasn't completed). `FlowRunner`
    renders the flow's declared `successMessage` / `errorMessage` (from the
    terminal `AutomationResult`) instead of a generic "Done" / the raw error.

- 2270239: feat: scoped style-object rendering (ADR-0065)

  A metadata node may carry `responsiveStyles` (per-breakpoint CSS-property maps);
  `SchemaRenderer` compiles it to **id-scoped CSS** injected as a `<style>` tag and
  appends a scope class to the node. Build-independent (arbitrary values + design
  tokens pass through verbatim — no Tailwind JIT), collision-free (per-node scope,
  unlayered so it beats base utilities), responsive-correct (model breakpoint maps
  → generated `@media`, never `md:` variant classes). Adds `compileScopedStyles`/
  `scopeClassFor`/`hasResponsiveStyles` to `@object-ui/core` and an SDUI design-token

- 5976ba3: fix(core): evaluate bare CEL predicates in `evaluateCondition`

  `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluateCondition` delegated to `evaluate`, which only
  processes `${...}` templates and returns any other string verbatim. A bare
  predicate such as `record.status == "converted"` (the shape `objectstack build`
  emits for `disabled`/`visible`/`condition`) was therefore returned as a
  non-empty string and coerced to `true` — so every bare-expression predicate was
  silently always-truthy.

  The most visible symptom: a param-collecting `api` action invoked from the
  record header (e.g. CRM "Reassign Lead") was treated as permanently `disabled`,
  so `ActionRunner.execute` bailed before opening the param dialog. The renderer
  (`page:header`) was unaffected because it evaluates via `evaluateExpression`
  directly.

  `evaluateCondition` now treats a non-`${}` condition as a single expression
  (via `evaluateExpression`), keeps the `${...}` template path, and preserves the
  "empty/undefined ⇒ visible/enabled" and "unparseable ⇒ default visible/enabled"
  fallbacks. Also hardens `ActionRunner`'s `disabled` gate to evaluate the
  boolean/string/envelope form rather than treating any object as truthy, and
  unifies the grid row-action predicate scope so `record.*` and bare-field
  predicates resolve identically on every surface.

- eaccefd: fix(actions): warn when an action is hidden by a throwing `visible` predicate

  `ActionEngine.getActionsForLocation` is fail-closed: a `visible` predicate that
  throws hides the action. The most common cause is an authoring bug — a BARE
  field reference (`done` instead of `record.done`), which is undeclared in the
  `{ record, recordId, objectName, user }` eval scope. Hiding it silently made
  that bug invisible (a long debugging hunt). The catch now emits a one-time
  `console.warn` naming the action + predicate + error, with the `record.<field>`
  tip. Deduped per predicate so re-renders don't spam.

- 71d7ce0: fix(actions): handle `type: 'form'` in ActionRunner

  A `form` action had no `case` in `ActionRunner`'s execution switch, so it fell
  through to `executeActionSchema` and silently no-opped — clicking a Log-Time /
  "open form" action did nothing. Add `executeForm`, which opens the FormView as a
  routed page (`/forms/:name`, per the action spec) via the navigation handler,
  forwarding the current record id as `?recordId=` for hosts that support it.
  Covered by ActionRunner unit tests.

- 2d47e94: B2 follow-ups (A): field conditional rules in inline grids + submit-time enforcement.

  - **Grids**: a line-item column's `readonlyWhen` / `requiredWhen` CEL rule is now honored per row — `deriveMasterDetail` carries the props onto the `GridColumn` and `GridField` evaluates them against each row via `resolveFieldRuleState` (a `readonlyWhen`-TRUE cell locks; a `requiredWhen`-TRUE empty cell flags inline-invalid). Rules are row-scoped (`record.*`); the core helpers gained an optional `scope` (and `GridField` a `contextRecord` prop) so a future header-driven lock can bind `parent.*` — that wiring is deferred (it needs the master-detail header's re-renders isolated).
  - **Submit enforcement**: `requiredWhen` already drove react-hook-form's `required` rule, so submit is blocked with a field error when the predicate is TRUE and the value is empty. Added a reactive cleanup so a stale _required_ error clears when the predicate flips FALSE (and all errors clear when a field is hidden by `visibleWhen`).

- c3749eb: feat(dashboard): dataset chart widgets drill through to records

  Dataset-bound **chart** widgets (bar/line/pie/area/donut/funnel/…) are now
  click-drillable, matching table/pivot. Clicking a segment maps it back to its
  dataset row and opens the same governed drill drawer (raw group keys preserved),
  so a chart-only dashboard is no longer an exploration dead-end. This closes the
  "object-backed chart drills but dataset chart doesn't" inconsistency and aligns
  with mainstream BI (click a chart → see records).

  - `@object-ui/core`: `findChartSeriesRow` — inverse of `buildChartSeries`,
    maps a clicked `{category, series}` back to the source dataset row index
    (matches both dims when a 2nd dimension is pivoted into series).
  - `ObjectChart`: optional `onSegmentClick` lets a host own the chart click
    (and suppress the widget's own object-drill).
  - `DatasetWidget`: lifts the drill machinery to cover both table/pivot and
    chart, and wires the chart's segment click to the precise dataset drill.

- 1394e34: feat(chart): visualise the second dataset dimension as grouped series

  A dataset chart with two dimensions (e.g. `['status','priority']`) previously
  only rendered the first dimension — the second was invisible (repeated x-axis
  labels, no grouping). New shared `buildChartSeries` helper (`@object-ui/core`)
  pivots the second dimension into one series per value; `ObjectChart`
  (plugin-charts) and `DatasetWidget` (plugin-dashboard) both use it, so
  multi-dimension charts render consistently as grouped/coloured bars.

  Refs objectstack-ai/objectui#1759, objectstack-ai/objectstack#1890

- 7c239fd: Add `ComponentRegistry.unregister(type, namespace?)` — the inverse of
  `register()`. Clears the namespaced key and the bare-name fallback (when it
  still resolves to that registration) plus any matching lazy stub, and notifies
  subscribers only when something was removed. Lets callers (and tests) restore
  prior registry state cleanly.
- 8d1195d: Fix `type: 'url'` actions so they actually reach the backend in split-origin dev setups, and so reveal-once result dialogs render.

  - `ActionRunner.executeUrl`: when context provides `apiBase`, relative `/api/...`, `/_auth/...`, and `/_account/...` URLs are now promoted to absolute (`${apiBase}${path}`) before navigation. Same-origin API paths (with or without `apiBase`) trigger a full-page `window.location.href` rather than React-Router push — this is required for server-side OAuth redirect dances (e.g. better-auth `/sign-in/social`) that React Router would otherwise swallow into the SPA's fallback route.
  - `ActionRunner.buildInterpolationContext`: surfaces `ctx.apiBase` for action targets that want to template it explicitly.
  - `ObjectView`: passes `apiBase: import.meta.env.VITE_SERVER_URL` into the toolbar `ActionProvider` context so the above resolves.
  - `action-button` and `action-menu` renderers now forward `resultDialog` when invoking the runner. Previously this field was silently dropped by an explicit whitelist, breaking every "show once, then hide" flow (2FA QR/backup codes, OAuth client_secret, regenerated tokens).

### Minor Changes

- de0c5e6: Add `DataSource.bulkDelete(resource, ids)` as the symmetric counterpart
  to `bulkUpdate`. Implemented in `data-objectstack` via the client's
  `deleteMany` primitive with a per-id fallback that emulates
  `continueOnError` semantics for older clients.

  Extract the bulk-vs-per-row decision into a reusable
  `executeBulkBatch(input, ops)` helper in `@object-ui/core`:

  - Single decision tree shared by both update and delete fast paths.
  - Bulk success → no per-row pass.
  - Bulk partial-count → aggregate batch error.
  - Bulk throw → per-row fallback so users still get id-level error detail.

  `useBulkExecutor` in plugin-grid now uses the helper for both `update`
  and `delete` batches, cutting "delete 500 selected rows" from 500 HTTP
  requests down to ~3.

### Patch Changes

- d1442e3: test(core): comprehensive security + correctness tests for SafeExpressionParser

  Add a ~50-case suite covering literals, operators, ternary, property
  access, calls/arrows, and a full security section (blocks
  `constructor` / `__proto__` / `prototype` / `__defineGetter__` /
  `__defineSetter__`, denies `eval` / `Function` / `window` / `process`,
  rejects assignment syntax). No production code changes.

- 5b80cfd: feat: Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) on DataSource writes

  `DataSource.update()` and `DataSource.delete()` now accept an optional fourth /
  third argument `opts?: { ifMatch?: string }`. When supplied, adapters forward
  the token to the backend; servers that implement OCC (e.g. ObjectStack
  `>=4.2.0`) compare it against the record's current `updated_at` and reject
  with `409 CONCURRENT_UPDATE` on mismatch, preventing silent overwrites in
  multi-user editing scenarios.

  **`@object-ui/data-objectstack`**

  - Exports `ConcurrentUpdateError` (carries `currentVersion` and
    `currentRecord`) and `isConcurrentUpdateError()` type guard.
  - `update()` / `delete()` accept `opts.ifMatch` and forward it via the
    `@objectstack/client` data API (header: `If-Match`). Requires
    `@objectstack/client@>=4.1.2` for the header to reach the server;
    older clients silently drop the option and fall back to today's
    "last writer wins" behaviour.
  - Adapter-level error handling maps a 409 with `code === 'CONCURRENT_UPDATE'`
    into a typed `ConcurrentUpdateError` so callers can detect and recover
    from conflicts without parsing the wire format.

  **`@object-ui/core`**

  - `ApiDataSource.update()` and `.delete()` accept `opts.ifMatch` and emit
    the `If-Match` HTTP header.

  UI consumers (Detail view, inline cell-edit) will be wired in a follow-up
  patch to capture `updated_at` at load time, pass it as `ifMatch` on save,
  and present a Reload / Overwrite / Cancel dialog on conflict.

- 7c9b85c: Fix compatibility with the framework's normalized Expression envelope format.

  `@objectstack/spec` now emits predicate (`visible` / `enabled`) and template
  (`titleFormat`) fields as `{ dialect, source }` envelopes instead of bare
  strings. The previous implementation assumed strings and crashed the record
  detail view (`TypeError: titleFormat.replace is not a function`) and printed
  `Failed to evaluate expression: ${[object Object]}` for every action visibility
  predicate.

  - `@object-ui/core`: `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluate` / `evaluateCondition` now
    unwrap Expression envelopes transparently.
  - `@object-ui/react`: new `toPredicateInput()` helper to safely normalize
    `boolean | string | Expression` predicate inputs into the `${expr}` form
    expected by `useCondition`.
  - `@object-ui/components`: `action-bar`, `action-button`, `action-group`,
    `action-icon`, `action-menu` renderers use `toPredicateInput()` instead of
    template-literal interpolation that produced `${[object Object]}`.
  - `@object-ui/plugin-detail`, `@object-ui/plugin-kanban`,
    `@object-ui/plugin-calendar`, `@object-ui/app-shell`,
    `@object-ui/console`: title-format helpers accept both legacy strings and
    the new `{ source }` envelope.

  All changes are backward-compatible — legacy bare strings continue to work.

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).
