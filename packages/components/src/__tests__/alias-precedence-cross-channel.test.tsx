/**
 * objectui#5123 — one key, one answer, through REAL production renderers.
 *
 * The companion pin in
 * `packages/react/src/__tests__/SchemaRenderer.aliasPrecedenceCrossChannel.test.tsx`
 * states the invariant against a probe, because `@object-ui/react` by design
 * does not depend on `@object-ui/components`. This file is the other half: the
 * same node shape driven through the two renderer FAMILIES the defect actually
 * split, with no stand-in for either read path.
 *
 *   - `element:text` is the `readProps()` family — it reads its config out of
 *     the CONFIG BAG (`{ ...schema.props, ...schema.properties }`). The five
 *     members on `main` are `elements.tsx`, `text-input.tsx`,
 *     `record-picker.tsx`, `data-list.tsx`, `metadata-viewer.tsx`; a sixth,
 *     `plugin-detail/src/renderers/record-alert.tsx`, merges
 *     `{ ...schema, ...schema.properties }` — a different expression of the
 *     same `properties`-wins order.
 *   - `badge` is the SPREAD path — it takes what `createElement` hands it as
 *     React props (`{ schema, ...props }`) and puts it on the DOM. Everything
 *     outside the `readProps()` family reads this way.
 *
 * Before the fix these two families disagreed about the SAME key on the SAME
 * node, in opposite directions: the bag read `properties`, the prop read
 * `props`. Which one reached the screen depended only on which family the
 * author's chosen component happened to belong to. Ruled 2026-08-18:
 * `properties` wins on BOTH — the bag order was already right and is untouched.
 *
 * Requirement (2) of that ruling is why this file exists at all: pinning only
 * the channel the fix edited would let the two drift apart again, which is the
 * defect CLASS rather than the one spread order. So the assertions below are
 * cross-family equalities, not per-file readings.
