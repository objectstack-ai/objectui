/**
 * `useOpenRecordList` — the console's implementation of the drill "escape
 * hatch" (`DrillNavigationContext.openRecordList`).
 *
 * Navigates to the object's ADR-0055 bare data surface, scoped by a record
 * filter, using the console's `/apps/:appName/:object/data?filter[...]` route
 * shape. Equality dims serialize to `filter[field]=value`; a date-bucket drill's
 * range serializes to `filter[field][gte]=…&filter[field][lt]=…` (#1752). Wire it
 * into a `DrillNavigationProvider` so the dashboard/report drill drawers can offer
 * "Open in list →" and honor `drillDown.target: 'navigate'`.
 *
 * ## Placeholders are resolved HERE, because this is where the scope is
 * (objectui#9022)
 *
 * Every widget composes its drill filter from the RAW authored `schema.filter`
 * — `ObjectChart`'s `drillFilter` memo and `DrillDownDrawer`'s `filter` prop
 * both do — so the value arriving here still carries whatever placeholders the
 * author wrote: `{current_user_id}`, `{current_org_id}`, and the relative-date
 * macros. Resolving it before serialization is what makes ONE drill mean ONE
 * scope regardless of `drillDown.target`:
 *
 *   - `target: 'drawer'` renders `object-data-table`, whose own fetch calls
 *     `resolveFilterPlaceholders(schema.filter, filterScope)` — so the drawer
 *     arm has always been scoped by the RESOLVED value;
 *   - `target: 'navigate'` (and the "Open in list →" button on either widget
 *     family) comes through here, and used to write the placeholder into the
 *     URL verbatim. `filter[close_date][gte]={current_quarter_start}` parses
 *     back on the READ side as an ordinary string comparand, so the list
 *     matched nothing — silently, and in disagreement with the chart bar the
 *     user had just clicked, which `ObjectChart` scopes by the resolved value.
 *
 * ⛔ Deliberately NOT inside `serializeDrillFilterParams`: that function is a
 * pure URL encoder which writes faithfully what it is handed, and the scope is
 * a React context read, so putting the resolution there would make a pure
 * function scope-dependent while leaving the callers holding the scope anyway.
 *
 * ⛔ And deliberately NOT at each widget's drill seam: `openRecordList` is the
 * single host-provided handler every drill escape hatch funnels through
 * (`ObjectChart`'s navigate arm and its own header button, `DrillDownDrawer`'s
 * navigate arm, and `OpenInListButton`), so resolving once here covers both
 * widget families and every future caller, instead of N seams the next
 * hand-rolled drill panel would forget.
 *
 * Resolution cannot change a filter that carries no placeholder: both
 * vocabularies substitute whole-string `{token}` values only and pass
 * everything else through untouched, so a placeholder-free drill produces a
 * byte-identical URL.
