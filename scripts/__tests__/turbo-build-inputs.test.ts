/**
 * objectui#4185 — turbo's `build` task has the same out-of-package `inputs`
 * hole that objectui#3514 closed for `type-check`, objectui#4178 closed for
 * `test` and objectui#4184 closes for `lint`. This is the fourth instance and
 * the one with the widest blast radius.
 *
 * Turbo hashes a task from its `inputs`. `$TURBO_DEFAULT$` covers only files
 * inside the package directory, and `globalDependencies` is unset — so any file
 * the task reads from elsewhere in the repo is invisible to the cache key. When
 * such a file changes, turbo does not re-run the task; it REPLAYS the previous
 * verdict. `build` declared no `inputs` AT ALL, so it ran on that default,
 * while:
 *
 *  - 14 packages build with a bare `tsc` whose `tsconfig.json` extends the
 *    repo-root `tsconfig.json` (and `examples/byo-backend-console` extends the
 *    root `tsconfig.tier-base.json`). Compiler options are as load-bearing as
 *    source: flipping `strict` there changes every package's output.
 *  - `apps/console`'s `vite.config.ts` imports `../../scripts/vite-crypto-stub.ts`
 *    and `../../scripts/vite-maplibre-worker.ts`. `type-check` covers those;
 *    `build`, the task that actually RUNS that Vite config, did not.
 *
 * Measured on `main` at 2b9428338:
 *
 *     @object-ui/core#build      baseline                     3f85d1417964dce6
 *                                after touching tsconfig.json 3f85d1417964dce6  <- frozen
 *                                after touching tsconfig.tier-base.json
 *                                                             3f85d1417964dce6  <- frozen
 *     @object-ui/console#build   baseline                     a17b12650e52ce28
 *                                after touching
 *                                scripts/vite-crypto-stub.ts  a17b12650e52ce28  <- frozen
 *
 * `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/performance-budget.yml`
 * both run `turbo run build` with `.turbo/cache` persisted through
 * `actions/cache`, so the stale verdict travels between runs. And `build` is
 * the task every other task consumes: `test` and `type-check` both declare
 * `dependsOn: ["^build"]`, so a `dist/` replayed from a cache key that ignored
 * a root-tsconfig change is handed to everything downstream.
 *
 * The derivation lives in `./helpers/build-program.ts`. Unlike its three
 * siblings it is a UNION rather than one walk, because `build` scripts are not
 * uniform — they are `&&` chains over tsc, `vite build`, `tsup`, `next build`,
 * `node <script>` and `pnpm <script>`, and each tool reads its own config. That
 * module's docblock carries the mechanism and its stated narrowings; this file
 * carries only the policy over the result.
 *
 * The policy is the family's: every out-of-package file must be matched by a
 * `$TURBO_ROOT$` input, two assertions police the reverse direction, one pins
 * the sweep's liveness, one pins that the new explicit list did not narrow what
 * the old default covered, and two pin premises the sweep rests on.
