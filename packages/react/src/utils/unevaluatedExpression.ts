/**
 * Dev-build diagnostic: an UNEVALUATED template expression reached the DOM.
 *
 * ## The defect this names (objectui#4795, Direction 3)
 *
 * A value only reaches the user if it passes two gates: `SchemaRenderer`
 * must EVALUATE it, and the renderer must READ IT BACK. Those two sets do not
 * fully overlap, and where they miss, the failure is SILENT — measured on a
 * real render with `dataSource: { total: 99 }`:
 *
 *   { type: 'ui:statistic', value: '${data.n}' }            -> screen shows
 *                                                              `${data.n}`
 *   { type: 'ui:card', props: { title: '${data.total}' } }  -> card body EMPTY
 *                                                              (the evaluated
 *                                                              `99` landed on a
 *                                                              DOM attribute)
 *
 * The first shape is what this module catches: the memo in `SchemaRenderer`
 * evaluates `content`, the `properties` / `props` bags and the predicate keys,
 * and passes every other top-level key through untouched — so the raw source
 * text is what the renderer receives, and it is placed verbatim. An author
 * (increasingly, an AI authoring metadata) gets no signal at all: a literal
 * `${data.n}` on screen reads like a data problem, not a contract violation.
 *
 * The second shape this module also catches, in its residue form: when an
 * expression IS evaluated but the evaluation THROWS, `ExpressionEvaluator`
 * returns the original source verbatim (`return match` in its interpolation
 * branch, `defaultValue ?? expression` in its outer catch), so a failed
 * evaluation is indistinguishable on screen from a key that was never
 * evaluated at all. Both end as raw `${…}` in front of a user.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It changes NO evaluation behaviour — it reads the schema after the memo has
 * run and reports. Widening the set of evaluated keys is objectui#4795's
 * Direction 1, which the maintainer DEFERRED behind a named restart condition
 * (ruling of 2026-08-17); this diagnostic is Direction 3 and must not
 * pre-empt it. Merging `props` into the node (Direction 2) is permanently
 * rejected.
 *
 * ## Depth: exactly the evaluator's own radius, and not one level more
 *
 * The scan is SHALLOW because evaluation is shallow. `ExpressionEvaluator`
 * returns every non-string untouched, so a nested `aria: { label: '${…}' }`
 * under either bag keeps its raw source today — deliberately, and pinned as
 * such by objectui#4799's parity tests. A deeper scan would therefore report,
 * as a defect, a shape the repo has explicitly decided not to change yet: the
 * diagnostic would be louder than the contract it speaks for. Deepening
 * evaluation is a separate decision, and this scan follows it the day it is
 * taken, not before.
 *
 * That decision has been taken for exactly ONE key: `params` (objectui#7867,
 * ruling A). Every string leaf of a `params` bag is evaluated, at any depth,
 * on every channel — so this scan walks the same leaves, through the same
 * walker (`paramsBag.ts`, which the evaluation memo also uses), and a template
 * that still cannot resolve is reported by its path (`params.target.id`,
 * `properties.params.ids[0]`). Radius equal to evaluation by construction,
 * not by two copies agreeing; every other key stays shallow on both sides.

 * Build the message. Separate from the emit so a test can assert the words a
 * developer is going to read, not merely that something was logged.
 *
 * ## Why `properties.*` is in the channel list (objectui#7849)
 *
 * It was missing, and the omission CONTRADICTED the sibling diagnostic in
 * `propsBagDiagnostic.ts`, which tells an author who wrote the same key one
 * envelope out: *"`props` is NOT hoisted onto the node — only `properties.*`
 * is … Write them under `properties` instead."* An author whose node trips
 * both messages was told to use `properties` by one and, by the other, that
 * the only channels that work are `content` or host-side resolution.
 *
 * The enumeration was the wrong half. `properties` is not a channel on its way
 * out and there is no retirement on record for it: `@objectstack/spec@17.2.0`
 * calls the vocabulary carried there *"ALIVE — this is not dead surface to
 * retire under ADR-0049"*, keeps `PageComponentSchema.properties` as the open
 * carrier ON PURPOSE, gates it at the authoring door
 * (`validate-component-props.ts`), and tombstones no part of it via
 * `retiredKey()`. In THIS repo `props` — not `properties` — is the spelling
 * annotated as the legacy alias (`SchemaRenderer.tsx`: "the legacy `props`
 * bag, minus every key the canonical `properties` bag also …").
 *
 * Measured on this branch's base through the real renderers, not inferred:
 * `badge` with `properties.label = '${data.status}'` renders `completed` and
 * applies the variant classes; `card` with a conditional
 * `properties.className` renders `class="… border-red-500"`; the same keys
 * under `props` render an EMPTY badge body and no `border-red-500`.
 *
 * The words are borrowed from the sibling message on purpose — one hoist, one
 * vocabulary, so the two diagnostics cannot drift apart again. Pinned by
 * `__tests__/diagnosticChannelConsistency.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why `params` is in it too (objectui#7867)
 *
 * The same defect #7849 closed, one channel later: once every string leaf of a
 * `params` bag evaluates, an enumeration that left `params` out would tell an
 * author whose `params.recordId` template THREW that `params` is not a channel
 * at all — and send them to move a correct key somewhere else. A finding on a
 * `params` leaf always means the second sentence above (the expression threw),
 * never the first.
