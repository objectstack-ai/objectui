/**
 * THE UNIVERSAL containment census — declared ⇔ rendered, over the whole
 * registry, in BOTH directions (objectui#6779, re-pointed by objectui#9910).
 *
 * ## What this file pins
 *
 * A registration that puts an authored `children` list on the page declares
 * `{ name: 'children', type: 'slot' }` in its `inputs`, and ONLY that
 * declaration decides `sdui-parser`'s `not-a-container` diagnostic
 * (`acceptsChildren` in `packages/sdui-parser/src/validate.ts`). Three facts,
 * each held against the live registry rather than the source:
 *
 *   1. RENDERS ⇒ DECLARES. A renderer that puts the list on the page and
 *      declares no `children` input is a NEW violation — declare the input.
 *   2. DECLARES ⇒ RENDERS. A `children` input whose renderer never puts the
 *      list on the page — bare, or in the context it renders in — is a lie
 *      the designer would offer and the tier would bless. Delete it, or probe
 *      it in context (`CONTEXT_PROBES`).
 *   3. THE TIER READS THE INPUT AND NOTHING ELSE. `not-a-container` fires on
 *      exactly the undeclared registrations, whatever `isContainer` says.
 *
 * ## Why the predicate moved off the flag (objectui#9910)
 *
 * objectui#6779 built this census over `isContainer`, because that flag was
 * what `validateTree` read. The flag was hand-kept and it drifted from the
 * code four times (objectui#3900 / #6740 / #6764 / #6779); then objectui#6771
 * converged a dozen `schema.body` readers onto `children`, objectui#6804 had
 * ruled the flag OFF for that population (it means LAYOUT containment, and
 * declaring it deletes a public tag from every react page's JSX scope), and
 * the diagnostic landed FALSE on the one key those registrations read. The
 * maintainer ruled 2026-09-24 (objectui#9910 Q1-A, declare-and-pin): the
 * containment declaration is the `children` slot input, the tier reads only
 * it, and this census holds it both ways. `isContainer` keeps its layout
 * meaning (Q2-A) and decides nothing here — pinned below as a control.
 *
 * ## The instrument, and why it is a RUNTIME one
 *
 * objectui#6779 measured four reasons a source-side spelling of "does this
 * renderer read `schema.children`?" cannot be built: the tree's own reader
 * refuses computed keys and 41 of 53 registered from a loop variable; file
 * granularity mis-reads a file holding two registrations; WHICH registration
 * is live is a whole-program import-order fact; and "children or body" is not
 * a distinction a source predicate keeps. So the predicate is behavioural and
 * executed: render the tag through the real `SchemaRenderer` with one
 * authored child and ask whether that child reached the DOM.
 *
 * The bare probe has two blind spots, and both are handled by NAME rather
 * than skipped: a renderer that only mounts inside a provider (`sidebar`,
 * `sidebar-menu-button` need `sidebar-provider`), and a portal that renders
 * only when open (`tooltip`). `CONTEXT_PROBES` renders each in its context,
 * and pins that the context is still NEEDED — a fixture whose subject starts
 * rendering bare is dead weight and goes red, the same way a baseline row
 * that stopped violating does.
 *
 * ## Population: every KNOWN key, namespaced spellings included
 *
 * objectui#6779 iterated bare tags only, on the ground that "the namespaced
 * twins are the same registration". That is true for `ui:h1` and `h1`, and
 * false for `sidebar` (the `ui` chrome part) versus `page:sidebar` (a
 * different renderer in `containers.tsx`), so a bare-only census scores
 * `page:sidebar` off `sidebar`'s row. Every known key is probed; a twin costs
 * one extra render.
 *
 * ## The ledger
 *
 * `scripts/container-declaration-baseline.json` is at ZERO — every row it
 * carried declared the slot in objectui#9910. It stays as the one place an
 * admitted violation could be recorded WITH a ruling; both maps must remain
 * consistent with the census (a listed row that does not violate is red), so
 * the file can only shrink back to empty.
