/**
 * The write-warning message — objectui#3484, points B and C.
 *
 * Two things were wrong with what the shell said when a save came back with
 * `droppedFields`:
 *
 *  - it named fields by their API key (`type, source_method`), which is not
 *    what the user is looking at; and
 *  - "Some fields were not saved" landed beside the save surface's own
 *    "Updated" toast, so the two read as a contradiction with nothing telling
 *    the user which had actually happened.
 *
 * It now resolves labels off the object schema (the adapter caches it) and says
 * one coherent thing: saved, and here is what did not take effect.
 *
 * A third thing was wrong, one reason later (objectui#3935): the wording was
 * picked by a two-way conditional on `readonly_when`, so every reason the write
 * path gained afterwards was announced as read-only. The reason table is now
 * exhaustive over the spec union, and the suite pins each reason's own sentence
 * plus the skew case a `Record` cannot cover.
 *
 * The sink is a PARAMETER, so this suite mocks no module. That is not a style
 * preference: `vitest.config.mts` runs the `unit` project with `isolate: false`
 * (one module graph per worker), where a `vi.mock('sonner')` holds only if no
 * other file in the same worker imported the real thing first — green when the
 * run is small, red once the whole repo is in flight.
