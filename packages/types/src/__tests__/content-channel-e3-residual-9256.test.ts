 * objectui#9256 — the E3 RESIDUAL: registrations that have a published arm and
 * whose renderer reads NEITHER content channel, moved onto this card by the
 * maintainer's ruling on objectui#8284 (Q2 A: family-D-shaped, narrowed under
 * that card's ruling 「1」 — every component schema narrows to the channel its
 * renderer actually reads and tombstones the other). Family D's own pins live in
 * `content-channel-family-d-9256.test.ts`; this file carries the ones this slice
 * adds, and nothing it pins is restated there.
 *
 * ## What is narrowed here
 *
 * The nine `object-*` views, `detail-view`, and the `email` / `password` input
 * shorthands: both `body` and `children` are `?: never` on the TypeScript face
 * and a by-name refusal on the zod mirror (two `retirementTombstone` members fed
 * one `neitherContentChannelGuidance` string), each kept a MEMBER so
 * `zod-mirror-parity`'s key sets stay equal. `body` was already refused by `BaseSchema` (objectui#6771), but
 * that refusal names `children` as the remedy and `children` is dead here too,
 * so each node restates it with a message naming what the node renders instead.
 *
 * READERSHIP was measured, not inherited from the ruling's table: a TypeScript
 * compiler-API sweep over one program per workspace package, on a BUILT tree,
 * files every `.body` / `.children` read under the declared type of its
 * receiver. It answers zero for every declaration narrowed here while its lit
 * controls (`ButtonSchema`, `DivSchema`, `CardSchema`, `ContainerSchema`) fire,
 * and the same program sees every one of these declarations as the receiver of
 * the keys its renderer reads, so the zeros are readings and not blindness.
 * Every registration hop here is `any`-typed; each was attributed directly —
 * it hands the node to a component typed by the declaration above, or (for
 * `email` / `password`) spreads it into the `input` renderer typed
 * `InputSchema`. The delegation hosts were checked for pass-through: every node
 * `ObjectView` / `ObjectForm` / `ObjectGrid` / `ObjectChart` / `DetailView`
 * hands to `SchemaRenderer` is assembled from named keys or from a sub-key, and
 * none copies the host's own channel.
 *
 * ## The `Omit` erasure, repaired (the ruling's execution parameter 3)
 *
 * `InputShorthandSchema` and `UiCalendarSchema` were spelled `Omit< Base, K >`
 * over an interface carrying `BaseSchema`'s index signature, so the published
 * face declared nothing but what the interface wrote itself: `body` type-checked
 * on `email`, `children` on `ui:calendar`, and `label: 42` on `email`. Both now
 * inherit through `OmitDeclared` (`../form.ts`). `ui:calendar` gains NO new
 * refusal: its face re-exposes what `CalendarSchema` already declares, and its
 * mirror — a `.extend()` of that one — already refused both channels.
 *
 * ## HELD, and why — a decision, not appetite
 *
 * `br`, `hr` and `img` read neither channel either — the factory in
 * `renderers/basic/html-elements.tsx` passes `undefined` as a void tag's child —
 * but their only published arm is `HtmlElementSchema`, ONE object over 38 tags
 * whose renderer draws `children` for the other 35. Refusing the key on three
 * tags means splitting that family arm, which the option the ruling adopted
 * leaves to the parser tier (the registration declares no `children` slot on a
 * void tag, so `validateTree` already names it `not-a-container`) and which
 * objectui#9067's ruling declined for these families. The CONTROL below pins
 * the shared-arm reason, so the hold is visible rather than forgotten.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Half of this file is a COMPILE-TIME assertion and vitest CANNOT read it
 *
 * `?: never` is erased before a test runs. The `@ts-expect-error` lines in the
 * last block are read by `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` (the `type-check` script),
 * NOT by this runner: under vitest alone, deleting a tombstone from the
 * TypeScript face leaves every case here GREEN. Both readers are the gate.
