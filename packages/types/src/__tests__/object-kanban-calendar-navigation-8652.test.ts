 *
 * objectui#8652 — `navigation` is declared on the `object-kanban` and
 * `object-calendar` arms, on both published faces, BY REFERENCE to the spec.
 *
 * ## The ruling this executes
 *
 * Maintainer ruling on objectui#8652, verbatim 「B」: declare `navigation` on
 * the platform element schema first, then mirror it in this package. The spec
 * half shipped in `@objectstack/spec` 17.5.0 — its `ComponentPropsMap` entries
 * for both elements declare `navigation: NavigationConfigSchema.optional()` —
 * and that is the release this repository resolves. So this is the mirror
 * catching up with the contract (declared in spec ⇒ align the mirror), not a
 * key this package invents.
 *
 * ## What was measurably wrong
 *
 * Both renderers read the key (`ObjectKanban` and `ObjectCalendar`, each in its
 * `navConfig`), and neither arm declared it. On the TS face the read compiled
 * through `BaseSchema`'s `[key: string]: any`; on the zod face `.passthrough()`
 * kept any value unexamined. So `navigation: { mode: 'not-a-mode' }` passed
 * both faces of this package while the spec's own element schema refused it at
 * `navigation.mode`. The rows below are that opposite-answer pair, frozen: the
 * installed spec is read in the same run, so the two faces are compared against
 * the contract they mirror rather than against a copy of it written here.
 *
 * ## The value-level judgment, per arm
 *
 * Declaring a key on a `.passthrough()` face cannot refuse a MISSPELLED key
 * (objectui#7927's ceiling). What it buys is VALUE validation, so the pins are
 * value-level, the same judgment PR objectui#8799 pinned on the retired `kanban`
 * arm: a valid block parses, a bad `mode` is refused at `navigation.mode`, and a
 * bogus member INSIDE the block is refused. Each refusal is paired with the
 * same value under a key nothing declares, which is still ACCEPTED — the
 * control that makes the refusal this declaration's and nothing else's.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Not here
 *
 * `object-timeline` also carries `navigation` on 17.5.0; it is objectui#8654's
 * card and its arm is untouched by this one.
