/**
 * objectui#6238 — `MetadataService`'s delete path no longer PUTs a tombstone.
 *
 * `deleteObject` and `deleteMetadataItem` used to write
 * `{ name, enabled: false, _deleted: true }` through `client.meta.saveItem`,
 * i.e. `PUT /api/v1/meta/:type/:name`. Neither key is a metadata convention,
 * and the two halves of that failed differently — which is why this file
 * carries both a schema oracle and a WIRE oracle.
 *
 * ## What was measured before the fix
 *
 * Against the installed `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0 (ESM build), using
 * `getMetadataTypeSchema` — the registry the framework's own `saveMetaItem`
 * resolves a PUT's validator from (`resolveOverlaySchema`):
 *
 *   - 25 of the 26 registered overlay schemas refuse `enabled` and/or
 *     `_deleted` BY NAME, `object` among them (`422 INVALID_METADATA`,
 *     `unrecognized_keys ["enabled","_deleted"]`).
 *   - `view` is the exception, and it is the WORSE one: its schema tolerates
 *     unknown keys, and the framework persists the request item verbatim rather
 *     than `parsed.data`, so the tombstone was STORED. So were the four kinds
 *     with no registered schema at all (`analytics_cube`, `connector`,
 *     `sharing_rule`, `webhook`), which fall through unvalidated.
 *   - `_deleted` has no reader anywhere in the platform. So on exactly the
 *     categories that did not 422, the "soft delete" was a silent no-op that
 *     left the item live carrying two junk keys.
 *
 * Nothing strips them, and there is no spec surface for "this item exists but
 * is off" — `ObjectSchema`'s accept set has no such flag, and the near-spelling
 * `enable` is a capabilities MODULE OBJECT, so `enabled: false` -> `enable:
 * false` fails on the value where it passes on the name. There was therefore no
 * spelling to rename to and no convention to converge onto: the delete door
 * `DELETE /meta/:type/:name` is the whole answer, and it is the same request
 * `MetadataClient.reset` already issued for `MetadataObjectsPage`'s object
 * deletes.
 *
 * ## Why a wire oracle as well as the schema one
 *
 * `scripts/check-designer-field-key-parity.mjs` reads DECLARATIONS. It saw the
 * latent `enabled?: boolean` on `ObjectMetadataPayload` and it could not see
 * the tombstone at all — that body is a literal, not a declared shape, which is
 * the gate's own coverage note 1. So restoring only the WRITER, with the
 * declaration still deleted, leaves that gate green. Every case below that
 * asserts on a captured request is covering that half, and is the half that
 * reds if the tombstone comes back.
 *
 * ## Why the assertions are on captured requests rather than spies
 *
 * The claim is about bytes on the wire, and the two disagree in the case that
 * matters: a spy sees an in-memory body, and `JSON.stringify` drops
 * `undefined`. Every wire case here reads the real `RequestInit` the SDK handed
 * `fetch`.
