/**
 * `@object-ui/data-objectstack` ↔ `@objectstack/spec` symbol-collision guards
 * (objectui#3160, objectstack#4115 ledger batch 6).
 *
 * Four symbols here wore names the spec already owns. One really WAS the
 * spec's and now carries its binding (`DroppedFieldsEvent`); the other three
 * model something the spec has never modelled under that name and were
 * renamed:
 *
 *   CacheStats          → MetadataCacheStats
 *   MetadataSaveOptions → MetadataClientSaveOptions
 *   ValidationError     → DataApiValidationError
 *
 * A fourth rename joined the table later, from a different ledger:
 * `normalizeFilterOperator` → `toAstFilterOperator` (objectui#7265, rule 1's
 * DEBT block in `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs`). It is here because
 * the guard a rename needs is this one, whichever ledger sent it; what is
 * specific to it -- the site, the block, and the behaviour that refused BIND --
 * is in `scripts/__tests__/spec-symbol-ledger-data-objectstack-7265.test.ts`.
 *
 * The batch's own triage note said "data-objectstack is a direct client of the
 * spec protocol, so `SecurityPolicy` / `DroppedFieldsEvent` are probably hand
 * copies — derive them first". Half of that held: `DroppedFieldsEvent` was
 * exactly a hand copy. The batch's fifth symbol, `SecurityPolicy` →
 * `SecurityManagerPolicy`, shared not one key with the spec's; its guard is
 * gone from this file because objectui#4241 retired `SecurityManagerPolicy`
 * itself along with the rest of `security.ts` (a `v3.0.0 Deep Integration`
 * module with no consumer outside this package). That asymmetry is why every
 * assertion below is per SYMBOL and never per cluster.
 *
 * ## Why the spec's names are read through the compiler, not `import * as`
 *
 * A runtime namespace import sees VALUES only, and every name checked here is a
 * TYPE; a tripwire built on `Object.keys(await import(…))` would pass while
 * proving nothing. So this reads each subpath's `.d.ts` through the TypeScript
 * checker, exactly as `scripts/check-spec-symbol-derivation.mjs` does.
 *
 * ## …and why through `ts.sys` rather than `node:fs`
 *
 * Unlike the sibling batches' parity tests, this package's `tsconfig.json`
 * compiles its whole test tree (it is not in `check-type-check-coverage.mjs`'s
 * TEST_DEBT), so the pins below are already checked by `tsc --noEmit` with no
 * separate `tsconfig.typetests.json`. Keeping that property means NOT pulling
 * `@types/node` into a browser-side adapter's type environment just to read a
 * file — so the probe uses the TypeScript compiler's own host, which is typed
 * by the `typescript` dependency this file already has, and resolves the spec
 * through TS's module resolver instead of hard-coding its subpath list.
