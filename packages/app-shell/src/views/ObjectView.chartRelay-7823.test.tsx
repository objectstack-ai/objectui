/**
 * objectui#7823 — the object-view relay handed `ListView` a SIX-KEY PROJECTION
 * of the authored `chart:` block.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `renderListView` builds `fullSchema` by spreading the OBJECT's `listSchema`
 * and then relaying the active view's visualization blocks under `options`.
 * Every sibling block is relayed WHOLE — `gantt: ganttViewOptions(viewDef)`,
 * `timeline: timelineViewOptions(viewDef)`, `tree`/`gallery` by spread — but
 * `chart` was a hand-listed copy of exactly six keys:
 *
 *     chart: {
 *       chartType, xAxisField, yAxisFields, aggregation, series, config
 *     }
 *
 * That list is the PRE-ADR-0021 key set, frozen. `dataset`, `dimensions` and
 * `values` — the whole ADR-0021 (#1890) authoring shape — plus the legacy
 * `categoryField` / `valueField` spelling had no rung, so they were dropped
 * here and could not reach the renderer at all on this route.
 *
 * ## Why it became load-bearing
 *
 * objectui#7544 gave `ListView.availableViews` a chart capability check that
 * asks `resolveListChartBinding` — the render branch's own resolver — whether
 * the block it was handed binds to names the author wrote. Through this
 * projection an ADR-0021 block arrived as six `undefined` keys, so the gate
 * correctly answered "nothing declared" about a view whose author declared
 * everything: no Chart toggle, no diagnostic. The legacy
 * `xAxisField` / `yAxisFields` spelling survived the projection and did
 * resolve, so the two authoring shapes behaved differently on this route for
 * reasons that lived entirely in this one object literal.
 *
 * ## The fix is a POINTER, not a wider copy
 *
 * Widening the list from six keys to nine would buy ADR-0021's correctness and
 * re-arm the identical trap for the next block key — and nothing would fire
 * then either, because `viewDef` is `Record<string, any>` and a missing rung is
 * invisible to `tsc` (that mechanism is objectui#7559's, and #7559 explicitly
 * disclaims the census this card belongs to). A hand-listed key projection is a
 * COPY of a schema's key set, and copies rot silently. So the relay forwards
 * the authored block itself.
 *
 * The whole relay is safe to write because `ListView` never SPREADS this block:
 * `resolveListChartBinding` and `case 'chart'` both read it BY NAME
 * (`dataset` / `dimensions` / `values` / `chartType`; the legacy `xAxisField` /
 * `yAxisFields` / `categoryField` / `valueField` / `aggregation` / `series`
 * were read too until objectui#6152 round 15 retired them).
 * Extra authored keys arrive and are ignored, exactly as they are for `gantt`
 * and `tree`, so no key this relay stops dropping can collide downstream.
 *
 * ## Why the REAL `ListView` renders here
 *
 * The sibling relay tests in this directory stub `ListView` and inspect the
 * captured schema, which answers "what does this file hand down". This card's
 * claim is about the CAPABILITY GATE one seam further on, so the real component
 * renders and the assertion is the Chart toggle's presence in the DOM — the
 * objectui#6318 standard, that it renders differently. The captured schema is
 * asserted too, as the more precise statement of the same fact.
 *
 * ## Direction, written before the run (reverse verification)
 *
 * The six-key literal was PREDICTED to turn the four `THE FIX` arms RED (no
 * Chart tab, and `options.chart` carrying six `undefined` keys) while leaving
 * every CONTROL's behaviour assertion GREEN — the legacy `xAxisField` arm,
 * whose keys the projection already carried, and the three negative controls,
 * which declare no usable binding and must be offered nothing in either world.
 *
 * MEASURED on the unmodified tree, before the fix was written: 5 failed, 3
 * passed. Four of the five are the `THE FIX` arms. The fifth is the SCHEMA half
 * of the first negative control (`options.chart` was the six-`undefined`-key
 * husk, not absent) — its DOM half, the toggle, was green there as predicted
 * and stayed green after. After the fix: 8 passed.
 *
 * That asymmetry is the point: the old relay emitted a permanently truthy block
 * for EVERY view, so a "fix" that merely added three keys to the husk would
 * still hand the gate an object for a view that declared nothing. The negative
 * controls are what refuse that shape.
