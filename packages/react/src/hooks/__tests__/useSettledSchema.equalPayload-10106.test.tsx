 * ObjectUI — `useSettledSchema` republishes an EQUAL payload as the SAME

 *
 * ## What this file pins, and why a COUNT
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` §5 commandment #10 closes with the producer half of its ruling:
 * *"a provider that refetches may not republish an equal payload as a new
 * object, and a consumer that needs stability keys on the data, not on a
 * cache"*. This hook is such a provider — it re-reads `getObjectSchema`
 * whenever the adapter identity changes, and every consumer the hook's own doc
 * comment instructs (`ObjectGantt`, `ObjectCalendar`, `ObjectView`,
 * `ObjectTimeline`, `ObjectGallery`) keys its record fetch on `def`, which is
 * the CORRECT half of #10: keying on the payload, not on a memo identity.
 *
 * So the cost of a fresh-object republish lands on the consumer as a DUPLICATE
 * RECORD QUERY — and the count is what the next reader has to be told by a red
 * test rather than by a card. `ObjectGantt`'s own gate pin
 * (`ObjectGantt.fetchGate-7225.test.tsx`) counts `find` calls for the MOUNT
 * path only and deliberately does not pin this one, so nothing else in the
 * tree goes red on the day this regresses.
 *
 * ## The reading this file was written from (objectui#10106, first-hand)
 *
 * Measured on the REAL consumer, `ObjectGantt`, with an instrumented adapter,
 * swapping the adapter on provider `object` — three cases in ONE command, so
 * that 「two」 is a discrimination and not a counting artefact:
 *
 *   byte-identical answer as a FRESH object → 2 `find`, expand `[['owner'], ['owner']]`
 *   the SAME def object from both adapters  → 1 `find`, expand `[['owner']]`
 *   a genuinely DIFFERENT def               → 2 `find`, expand `[['owner'], ['owner','account']]`
 *
 * The middle row is the control that makes the top row a finding: the harness
 * counts ONE when the producer keeps the payload's identity, so the extra query
 * is the republish and nothing else. The bottom row is the one where two
 * queries are WARRANTED — the second carries an expand set the first could not
 * have — which is why the repair may never be "fetch less".
 *
 * ⚠️ Where the FIRST of those two queries comes from, since it is easy to
 * misread: `ready` is `resolution.key === key`, and an adapter swap does not
 * move the key — so `ready` stays TRUE right through the swap and a consumer's
 * gate does not hold anything back. The first query goes out immediately, on
 * the definition already in hand; the republish is what adds the second.
 *
 * ## The consumer harness below is the hook's OWN published recipe
 *
 * `useSettledSchema`'s doc comment carries an `@example` whose fetch effect
 * lists `objectSchemaReady` and `objectSchema` in its dependency list. The
 * harness here is that example, reduced to the one thing being counted. It
 * keys on the PAYLOAD, never on a `useMemo`/`useCallback` identity — so a
 * duplicate query through it is the producer's, by construction.
