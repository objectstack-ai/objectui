/**
 * objectui#7459 — an object-bound `ObjectTimeline` that declares NO date axis
 * refuses, and the refusal is REACHABLE.
 *
 * The sibling of `plugin-gantt`'s `ObjectGantt.unconfiguredRefusal-7070` and of
 * `plugin-calendar`'s #7029 twin, written for the maintainer ruling those two
 * produced (2026-09-01, objectui#7070, 总监批 #28): house posture is
 * 日期轴永不虚构 — a date axis is never fabricated.
 *
 * ## Why one file pins TWO changes
 *
 * The ruling ordered a refusal screen (①) and the retirement of the renderer's
 * own invented field name at the end of its resolver chain (②), and neither is
 * observable alone:
 *
 *   - a refusal added while the floor stands can never be TAKEN — the floor
 *     guaranteed a name always resolved, so the branch is dead code;
 *   - the floor retired with no refusal produces the outcome the ruling
 *     explicitly rejects: every record reads a key no object carries and
 *     buckets into "No date" — a timeline that looks built and is not.
 *
 * So the pairing itself is the subject. `renders the refusal` and `stays
 * reachable` below both go RED the moment the floor returns, and the fully
 * declared CONTROLS stay GREEN in both worlds — the asymmetry that separates
 * "stopped inventing" from "refuses everything".
 *
 * ## Refusal is not "an empty timeline", and that is asserted, not assumed
 *
 * The failure mode the ruling is trying to avoid renders a real timeline with
 * nothing on it, so a pin that only counts events passes on BOTH outcomes. Two
 * independent canvas markers are therefore asserted ABSENT here, each proven
 * non-vacuous by a control in this same file that asserts it PRESENT:
 *
 *   1. `data-testid="timeline-canvas"` — the component's own success surface.
 *      Named by #7459 precisely so this distinction could be measured; every
 *      other terminal state of the component already named itself.
 *   2. `role="list"` — the `<ol>` rail the REAL `TimelineRenderer` emits. An
 *      empty timeline still emits it, which is what makes it discriminating.
 *
 * The renderer is deliberately NOT stubbed, for the reason
 * `__tests__/timeline-object-bound-gantt-refusal.test.tsx` states one file
 * over: `ObjectTimeline.test.tsx` stubs `./renderer` and prints only titles, so
 * assertions there stay green whether or not the branch under test was reached.
 * Only the ambient React context hooks are mocked.
