/**
 * objectui#7070 step ③ — this face stops flooring the timeline axis at
 * `'created_at'`.
 *
 * Maintainer ruling 2026-09-01 (总监批 #28, objectui#7070): house posture
 * 日期轴永不虚构 — a date axis is never fabricated. The ruling sequenced three
 * steps and forbade reordering them:
 *
 *   ① `ObjectTimeline` gains a refusal screen for an absent date axis;
 *   ② the renderer's own `|| 'date'` floor is retired;
 *   ③ — THIS — the two plugin faces stop supplying `'created_at'`.
 *
 * ①② landed as `20cb8db9b` (PR #7467) and changed nothing a user could see,
 * precisely because this floor still stood: `ObjectTimeline` reads the FLAT
 * `schema.startDateField` at the tail of its resolver chain, so this branch
 * answered "the axis is bound" for every view and the screen ① installed was
 * unreachable from here. The ruling also names the two lines of prose that used
 * to sit on the deleted line ("`created_at` stays the last resort for a view
 * that declares no date axis anywhere") as a written decision it EXPLICITLY
 * replaces — a second, de-facto contract held at one face only, on the very
 * literal objectui#3129 retired at app-shell.
 *
 * ⭐ What the floor actually produced, measured rather than assumed: the axis it
 * invented was never even FETCHED. The `$select` projection is collected from
 * the DECLARED `schema.timeline` / `schema.options.timeline` blocks (see
 * `collectViewFields`), never from this flat prop — so an undeclared view got a
 * timeline bound to a column the query did not request and bucketed every record
 * into "No date". That is the outcome the refusal replaces.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted before running, then observed:
 * restore `|| 'created_at'` on the single line step ③ deletes and the three
 * "invents NO axis" cases (one of them above, in the objectui#3129 block) go
 * RED, while every CONTROL here stays GREEN in both worlds.
