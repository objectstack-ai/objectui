/**
 * objectui#9318 — the wrong-layer verdict comes from `@objectstack/lint`, not
 * from a second hand-maintained copy of it.
 *
 * ## What moved
 *
 * `rowCanonAdvisory` used to answer "is this root bound on this surface?" from
 * objectui's own knowledge: `@object-ui/core`'s `detectNonCanonicalRowSpelling`
 * hard-codes ONE root (`data`) and objectui's docblock justified that from
 * `ROW_PREDICATE_ROOTS` / `FIELD_RULE_ROOTS` / `FORMULA_ROOTS`. The platform
 * publishes the same judgement as `fieldRuleRootIssue` / `FIELD_RULE_BOUND_ROOTS`.
 * Two copies of one judgement agree today and nothing keeps them agreeing.
 *
 * ## What did NOT move, and is pinned here as such
 *
 * The helper judges against `FIELD_RULE_BOUND_ROOTS` = `record` / `previous` /
 * `parent` — whatever slot name it is handed. It has no vocabulary gate of its
 * own (measured: an unrecognised slot still returns a finding, not `null`), so
 * WHICH surfaces it may answer for is objectui's call, not the platform's. Two
 * of the surfaces `rowCanonAdvisory` guards bind a set that is not that one, and
 * neither is comparable to it — they overlap on `record` alone:
 *
 *  - the conditional-formatting `condition` binds `ROW_PREDICATE_ROOTS`
 *    (`record`, `current_user`, `user`, `features`, `os`, `ctx`) — five roots
 *    the field tier does not bind, but NOT a superset: no `previous`, no
 *    `parent`;
 *  - a `formula` field's `expression` binds `FORMULA_ROOTS` (`record`) — a
 *    proper subset.
 *
 * So the helper's verdict is adopted exactly on the three slots whose bound set
 * IS the field-rule set, and the local fallback is KEPT for the rest. The two
 * "uncovered surface" pins below are live controls for the failure this card
 * exists to stop, in miniature: routing every surface through the helper to
 * make the code tidier would redden them.
 *
 * Severity stays objectui's own mapping (`warning`, never `error`) on both
 * paths — every save gate on this tier counts `severity === 'error'`.
