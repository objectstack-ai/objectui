/**
 * objectui#8193 — the object page emitted the DEPRECATED view-level kanban
 * alias, into the one bag the alias fold is told not to reach.
 *
 * `ObjectView` built `options.kanban` and wrote `groupField` — never the
 * spec-canonical `groupByField` — even though it already READ the canonical key
 * first. Its sibling producer in this same package, `defaultKanbanFromObject`
 * (`InterfaceListPage`), had migrated long before and left the reasoning in a
 * comment: "that read-site now prefers the spec key, so one key is enough."
 * The twin twelve hundred lines away was not carried along, so one producer
 * surface spoke two vocabularies for one concept depending on which entry point
 * the user arrived through.
 *
 * ⭐ THE ANTI-FORK ARM IS THE DURABLE HALF OF THIS CARD. Pinning only
 * `kanbanViewOptions` would pin today's spelling; the defect was that the two
 * producers DRIFTED. So the vocabulary of both is derived and compared here —
 * whichever one a future edit moves, this file reddens.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY `normalizeListViewSchema` CANNOT SAVE THIS. The alias fold maps
 * `kanban.groupField` to `groupByField` on the DECLARED path only, and its own
 * suite pins that boundary as intentional ("does not reach into the legacy
 * `options.*` twin"). `ObjectView` writes into `options.kanban`, on the far
 * side of that boundary, so nothing folded it and the alias read was
 * load-bearing purely because of where this producer wrote.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ALIAS IS NOT RETIRED AND NO ALIAS READ WAS TOUCHED. Stored metadata
 * still authors `groupField`; `ListView` resolving `groupByField || groupField`
 * is exactly why the sibling could drop the alias write. The arms below assert
 * what this face WRITES, never what any face reads.
 *
 * ⚠️ `groupBy` WAS STILL WRITTEN WHEN THIS FILE LANDED, and is not any more:
 * objectui#8213 ran the producer census this file deferred and retired the
 * third spelling. The arms below that named it have been re-judged rather than
 * spelling-swapped — the spec-refusal arm is still true and still here, the
 * producer arm that asserted the write is gone, and the anti-fork arm no longer
 * has to filter `groupBy` out before comparing the two producers. What that
 * retirement asserts is pinned in `ObjectView.kanbanGroupByRetired-8213`.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted before running, then observed:
 * restore `return lane ? { groupBy: lane, groupField: lane } : {}` and the
 * canonical arms below go RED (the emitted bag loses `groupByField` and grows
 * `groupField` back), while the ADR-0085 lane-RESOLUTION controls stay GREEN in
 * either world — those read which FIELD was chosen, which the defect never
 * changed. That asymmetry is the point: this defect was never about the value,
 * only ever about the key it was filed under, so a test asserting the lane
 * field alone would have passed against the unfixed producer.
