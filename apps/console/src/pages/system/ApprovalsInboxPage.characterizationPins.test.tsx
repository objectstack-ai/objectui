/**
 * Approvals Inbox — characterization pins for three #2762 P1/P2 behaviours
 * that shipped in #2803/#2811 with no assertion of their own (objectui#6395).
 *
 * ## What this file is, and is not
 *
 * Triage's charter (objectui#6395, 2026-08-25 19:54Z): commit a characterization
 * suite for the three behaviours below. **No production-code change is
 * chartered** — these are pins on shipped, working behaviour, not a fix.
 *
 *  1. **Approver chips carry their 会签 group** — `approverChips()` keys by
 *     (name, group), so two different approver ids sharing one display name
 *     stay two distinguishable labelled chips instead of collapsing back into
 *     the reported symptom (#2811).
 *  2. **A flow-initiated request names its origin** — `isSystemSubmitter()`
 *     plus the "Flow-initiated" cell, instead of a bare person icon + em dash
 *     (#2803).
 *  3. **Record-card copy and emphasis** — `prettifyKey()` drops a trailing
 *     `id` token (`vendor_id` → "Vendor") and `decisionAmountEntry()` promotes
 *     the decision amount to a lead figure, excluded from the generic field
 *     grid so it renders exactly once (#2803).
 *
 * The fourth #2762 behaviour the finding named — declared action hierarchy
 * (`variant: 'primary'` renders filled, `variant: 'danger'` renders
 * destructive) — is already pinned at
 * `packages/app-shell/src/views/__tests__/DeclaredActionsBar.test.tsx`
 * ("maps the spec action `variant` onto Button variants"). Not duplicated
 * here.
 *
 * ## Why the fixture is non-degenerate — this is the load-bearing part
 *
 * A single-approver or single-group fixture passes against the PRE-FIX code
 * too, so it proves nothing about the regression each case exists to catch.
 * One shared row therefore carries, at once:
 *
 *  - **two different approver ids sharing one display name, filling two
 *    different 会签 groups** (`u_fin` → Finance, `u_leg` → Legal) — the
 *    fixture #2811 needed: same-name collapse only shows up when there are
 *    two people to conflate;
 *  - a **`flow:`-prefixed submitter id** with no `submitter_name` — the shape
 *    a real flow-initiated request arrives in;
 *  - a payload carrying **both `vendor_id` and `amount`** — `vendor_id` proves
 *    the id-token trim (a bare `id` key, or one with a resolvable non-`_id`
 *    name, would not exercise `prettifyKey`'s trim branch at all), `amount`
 *    proves both the lead-figure promotion and the single-render exclusion.
 *
 * `approverChips()` and the "Waiting on" chips are rendered only in the
 * drawer's business summary card (`selected.status === 'pending'` gate), and
 * `prettifyKey`/`decisionAmountEntry` back that same card — so all three cases
 * open the drawer. `isSystemSubmitter()` also renders identically in the
 * desktop table row and mobile card; the drawer header is exercised here
 * because it is already open for the other two cases, not because the table
 * row is untested code — same function, same gate, same behaviour.
 *
 * No build artifact sits between the edit and this test: the root Vitest
 * config aliases every `@object-ui` specifier at that package's source
 * directory, and the page under test is this app's own source.
