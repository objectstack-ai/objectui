/**
 * objectui#9092 — the DECLARED face of group A accepts the spec's inline locale
 * map, and the three pairs no longer restate the key as a plain `string`.
 *
 * ## What this pins, and why the pin has to be two-sided
 *
 * objectui#4580's revised Q1 ruling (option A) widened the label keys to the
 * spec's INLINE locale map, and `BaseSchema` carries it on both faces. Three
 * pairs restated the key as a plain `string`, which is a NARROWING override of
 * the inherited member — so their zod mirrors accepted an authored locale map
 * and `tsc` refused it. The narrowing sat on the DECLARED side, where a forward
 * mirror-vs-declaration comparison reads the pair as clean; `zod-mirror-parity`'s
 * `WiderThanDeclared` ledger is the instrument that saw it, and its entries for
 * these keys retired with this card.
 *
 * A one-sided pin would go green for the wrong reason. `BaseSchema` carries
 * `[key: string]: any`, so a key REMOVED from a declaration type-checks exactly
 * like a key WIDENED — the assignment below would keep compiling if someone
 * deleted the member outright. So each positive case is paired with a
 * `@ts-expect-error` negative on a key that is genuinely a plain `string`: a
 * `@ts-expect-error` whose error stops occurring is itself a compile error, so
 * that half fails loudly if the narrow face ever becomes uncheckable.
 *
 * ⚠️ The vocabulary split this card does NOT touch. The FLAT
 * `BaseSchema.ariaLabel` is the KEYED form (`{ key, defaultValue?, params? }`,
 * resolved by `resolveKeyedI18nLabel`), and objectui#4580 Q2-B withdrew the
 * `I18nLabel` spelling there as measured-wrong. The NESTED `aria.ariaLabel`
 * asserted below is the INLINE form — the spec's own `AriaPropsSchema`
 * spelling, and the one objectui#5134 made `ListView` resolve with
 * `resolveI18nLabel`.
 *
 * ⚠️ What this file asserts about the FLAT key, exactly. Only that an inline
 * map is REFUSED there. The four widening cases are the three NESTED/INLINE
 * members plus the `BaseSchema` reference face, and that reference case asserts
 * `label` and `description` — `BaseSchema.ariaLabel` has no positive assertion
 * anywhere in this file. An earlier draft of this header said "both are
 * asserted here, each against its own vocabulary"; it overstated what is here.
 *
 * ⚠️ And neither vocabulary admits the other. An earlier draft said the two
 * shapes "each accept the other vacuously" — quoted from objectui#4580 Q2-B,
 * true when that was written and measured FALSE on the installed pin.
 * `InlineLocaleMapSchema` types its map with `key?: never; defaultValue?: never`
 * and its own `INLINE_LOCALE_KEY` pattern excludes both names, so the cross
 * assignment is refused at `tsc` AND at parse. The last describe block below is
 * the instrument that re-derives that on every run — read it rather than this
 * sentence. What a wrong slot still costs is a wrong ANSWER, not a silent
 * acceptance: `resolveI18nLabel` hands a keyed ref back as its own `key` string.
 * So the advice is unchanged — check which resolver owns a slot before writing
 * an object into it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Two halves, two runners. Every `@ts-expect-error` and every typed
 * assignment below is read ONLY by `tsc -p packages/types/tsconfig.test.json`
 * (the package `type-check` script, and CI's Type Check job). `vitest` strips
 * types, so a vitest-only run is a FALSE GREEN on that half of this file.
