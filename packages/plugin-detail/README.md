# @object-ui/plugin-detail

DetailView plugin for ObjectUI - A comprehensive detail page component with field grouping, tabs, related lists, and action buttons.

## Features

- **Field Grouping/Sections**: Organize fields into logical sections with titles
- **Collapsible Sections**: Make sections collapsible to save space
- **Tab Navigation**: Organize content into tabs for better UX
- **Related Lists**: Display related records (e.g., contacts for an account) —
  authored as a `record:related_list` block, ⛔ not as a `detail-view` `related`
  array, which is retired (objectui#7997; see **RelatedList** below)
- **Action Buttons**: Edit, Delete, and custom action buttons
- **Readonly/Edit Mode**: Toggle between view and edit modes
- **Back Navigation**: Built-in back button with customizable behavior
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading for async data
- **Custom Headers/Footers**: Flexible customization options

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @object-ui/plugin-detail
```

## Usage

### Two ways to reach a data source

`detail-view` needs a data source to load a record, and there are two ways to
give it one. They are equivalent, and an explicit prop wins when both are
present:

```tsx
import { SchemaRenderer, SchemaRendererProvider } from '@object-ui/react';
import { DetailView } from '@object-ui/plugin-detail';
import type { DataSource } from '@object-ui/types';

declare const dataSource: DataSource;

// 1. Injected by an ancestor — the pattern the rest of the family uses, and the
//    one to reach for when a page renders several data-bound blocks.
const viaProvider = <SchemaRendererProvider dataSource={dataSource}>
  <SchemaRenderer schema={{ type: 'detail-view', objectName: 'account', resourceId: '42' }} />
</SchemaRendererProvider>;

// 2. Handed to one placement — what `<DetailView dataSource={…} />` has always
//    taken, and what the examples below use.
const viaProp = <DetailView schema={{ type: 'detail-view', objectName: 'account', resourceId: '42' }} dataSource={dataSource} />;
```

Route 1 is new as of objectui#5378: this block used to read the adapter from its
prop ONLY, while its siblings `object-grid` and `object-form` read it from
context only, so a page could satisfy one of them or the other and never both.
Nothing that worked before changed — route 2 is unaffected — and a block that
resolves neither now renders a **No data source resolved** panel naming itself
and the object it was about to read, instead of an empty shell.

Note the record id is `resourceId` here. `object-form`'s is `recordId`; the two
blocks do not share that key.

### Basic Example

```tsx
import { DetailView } from '@object-ui/plugin-detail';

function ContactDetail() {
  return (
    <DetailView
      schema={{
        type: 'detail-view',
        title: 'Contact Details',
        data: {
          name: 'John Doe',
          email: 'john@example.com',
          phone: '+1234567890',
          company: 'Acme Corp',
        },
        fields: [
          { name: 'name', label: 'Full Name' },
          { name: 'email', label: 'Email' },
          { name: 'phone', label: 'Phone' },
          { name: 'company', label: 'Company' },
        ],
        showBack: true,
        showEdit: true,
        showDelete: true,
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### With Sections

```tsx
import { DetailView } from '@object-ui/plugin-detail';

declare const accountData: Record<string, unknown>;

const accountDetail = <DetailView
  schema={{
    type: 'detail-view',
    title: 'Account Details',
    sections: [
      {
        title: 'Basic Information',
        icon: '📋',
        fields: [
          { name: 'name', label: 'Account Name' },
          { name: 'industry', label: 'Industry' },
          { name: 'website', label: 'Website' },
        ],
        columns: 2,
      },
      {
        title: 'Address',
        collapsible: true,
        defaultCollapsed: false,
        fields: [
          { name: 'street', label: 'Street' },
          { name: 'city', label: 'City' },
          { name: 'state', label: 'State' },
          { name: 'zipcode', label: 'Zip Code' },
        ],
        columns: 2,
      },
    ],
    data: accountData,
  }}
/>;
```

### With Tabs

```tsx
import { DetailView } from '@object-ui/plugin-detail';

declare const activityData: Record<string, unknown>[];
declare const navigate: (url: string) => void;
declare const deleteAccount: (id: string) => void;

const accountDetail = <DetailView
  schema={{
    type: 'detail-view',
    title: 'Account: Acme Corp',
    objectName: 'accounts',
    resourceId: '12345',
    fields: [
      { name: 'name', label: 'Account Name' },
      { name: 'industry', label: 'Industry' },
    ],
    tabs: [
      {
        key: 'details',
        label: 'Details',
        icon: '📄',
        content: {
          type: 'detail-section',
          fields: [
            { name: 'description', label: 'Description' },
            { name: 'employees', label: 'Employee Count' },
          ],
        },
      },
      {
        key: 'activity',
        label: 'Activity',
        badge: '12',
        content: {
          type: 'activity-timeline',
          data: activityData,
        },
      },
    ],
    showEdit: true,
    showDelete: true,
  }}
  onEdit={() => navigate('/accounts/12345/edit')}
  onDelete={() => deleteAccount('12345')}
  onBack={() => navigate('/accounts')}
/>;
```

## Schema

The DetailView component accepts a `DetailViewSchema`, declared in
`@object-ui/types`. Import it rather than re-typing it — every key below is
checked against that declaration, so this example cannot drift from the package:

```typescript
import type { DetailViewSchema } from '@object-ui/types';

const schema: DetailViewSchema = {
  type: 'detail-view',
  title: 'Account Details',
  objectName: 'accounts',
  resourceId: '12345',
  api: '/api/accounts/12345',
  data: undefined,
  // Field name whose value becomes the header title; `title` is the fallback.
  primaryField: 'name',
  // Field values rendered as badges beside the header title.
  summaryFields: ['industry', 'website'],
  layout: 'vertical',
  columns: 2,
  // See the examples above for the shapes these three carry.
  sections: [],
  fields: [],
  tabs: [],
  actions: [],
  showBack: true,
  backUrl: '/accounts',
  showEdit: true,
  editUrl: '/accounts/12345/edit',
  showDelete: true,
  deleteConfirmation: 'Delete this account?',
  loading: false,
  header: { type: 'text', label: 'Custom header' },
  footer: { type: 'text', label: 'Custom footer' },
};
```

### `summaryFields` and non-scalar values

A summary chip is a single-line pill, and it formats `currency`, `date`,
`datetime`, `percent` and the option families itself. Any other value it can
render as text it renders as text.

An **object** value — an expanded lookup payload, an address, a location, a
file — is drawn by that field's own cell renderer, so the chip shows what the
same value shows everywhere else on the page: the referenced record's name, the
formatted postal line, the coordinates, the file name.

Fifteen field kinds are the exception, because their renderer does not fit a
pill: the option families draw a badge (which would nest inside the chip's own),
`user` draws an avatar, `image` / `avatar` / `signature` draw an image and no
text at all, and `boolean` / `toggle` / `date` / `datetime` / `repeater` draw a
"No value" face for a value the chip only exists because the page called
filled. Those keep a text chip, carrying `@object-ui/fields`' shared value
coercion — the record's name where the object has one, and `[Object]` where it
does not. The set and the measurement behind it are
`src/summaryChipRenderers.ts`.

## Components

### DetailSection

Renders a group of fields with optional collapsing.

### DetailTabs

Tab navigation for organizing content into different views.

### RelatedList

Displays related records in list, grid, or table format.

Related lists are **paged by default**: the `record:related_list` renderer
applies the spec default `limit` of **5** when the node doesn't declare one
(`@objectstack/spec` `RecordRelatedListProps.limit`, "Number of records to
display initially"), so a child collection of any size renders as pages with
Previous/Next controls instead of one flat dump. On the auto-fetch path the
component asks the server for **one page at a time** (`$top`/`$skip`) and
reads the collection size from `QueryResult.total` (falling back to a
`hasMore` estimate), so large child tables never ship wholesale to the
browser. A user column sort becomes a server `$orderby` (ordering stays
global across pages), and the node's `sort` prop seeds the initial order.
Because that `$orderby` names a flat field, two kinds of column cannot survive
the trip. A **relational column** (`lookup` / `master_detail` / `user` / `tree`)
would order the collection by the stored foreign-key id while its cells show
related-record names (`objectui#3096`); a **`formula` column** has no
materialized column to order by at all — silently unordered rows under a `200`
before `objectstack#6994`, a `400 INVALID_SORT` after it (`objectui#3950`). So on
the windowed path neither offers a sort affordance, at either of this card's two
sort entry points: the embedded table's column headers, and the button row a
`list` card keeps because it has no headers. In client mode the sort key is the
value the cell shows — the label this list already resolved, the formula result
the server hydrated — so the affordance stays and orders by that.
Passing `data` directly keeps the historical client-side slicing, and typing
in the opt-in filter box temporarily falls back to the full-fetch client
pipeline (the contains-filter sweeps every field, which no generic server
filter can express).

The node's `filter` (spec `RecordRelatedListProps.filter`, "additional filter
criteria") narrows the list beyond the parent relationship: it is
**AND-combined** with the parent-relationship condition, never substituted for
it, so a related list stays scoped to the record it appears on and an additional
criterion can only ever narrow that set. That condition is **not one fixed
spelling** — it is compiled to match the relationship field's ARITY on the
child object (`objectui#7299`). A single-valued relationship gets the equality
form `{ [relationshipField]: parentId }`; a multi-valued one gets the membership
form `{ [relationshipField]: { $contains: parentId } }`, because the stored
value is an array of ids and equality would ask whether the whole array *is* one
id. The arity verdict is `@objectstack/spec/data`'s own `isMultiValueField`,
never a rule this package keeps locally. Authors write `filter` in the spec's own
vocabulary (`[{ field, operator, value }]`); a `dataSource` binding's composed
filter (component AND saved view AND binding) lands on the same key. Both are
lowered to ObjectQL through the repo's single filter sink, so no second dialect
appears.

**A third producer writes that same key: the relationship itself.** A `lookup` /
`master_detail` field may declare `relatedListFilter` (added to `@objectstack/spec`
in objectstack#8704 / PR #8955 — see this package's own `@objectstack/spec`
dependency in `package.json` for the version in use), a canonical Query-DSL
`FilterCondition` such as
`{ status: { $ne: 'deleted' } }`. `RecordDetailView` derives the record page's
related lists from the relationship graph and carries that value onto this node's
`filter`, so an auto-derived page honours it without anyone authoring a page
(objectui#4664). It is an authored constraint, not a user-editable suggestion —
it never becomes a filter-bar row — and it lands on the existing key rather than
a new one, so all three producers share one read site and one lowering.

The **tab badge honours the same composed filter**. `page:tabs` auto-derives a
Related tab's count from the `record:related_list` nodes underneath it, and that
probe reads this node's `filter` and composes it with the parent scope through
the same `mergeFilterNodes` sink the row query uses — one value, sent twice. That
is what keeps the badge from saying 7 above a list showing 3; it is normative in
the spec key's own contract text, not a nicety. Counts are cached per
(object, relationship, parent, **scope**), so a filtered and an unfiltered probe
over the same relationship never badge each other. On the legacy raw-URL fallback path (no `dataSource` adapter, where the
query language is `filter[<field>]=<value>` and cannot carry an operator) a
declared filter is refused with a console explanation rather than dropped —
answering with more rows than the metadata asked for is the failure this key's
wiring exists to remove.

The **Add** affordance renders only where every link in its chain is available:
a spec-valid `add.picker.object` *and* a `dataSource`. The picker dialog and the
add callback both required the adapter already, so without it the button used to
render and do nothing at all when clicked — visible in hosts that supply no
`RecordContext` (Studio designer previews, context-free embeds).

The `record:related_list` renderer is automatically gated on the current
user's object-level `read` permission for the child object: when the
permission system (`@object-ui/permissions`) is loaded and denies read,
the whole section renders nothing — no header, no empty grid, no "New"
button that would be rejected server-side. With no `PermissionProvider`
mounted (Studio designer, standalone embeds) the gate stays open.

### InlineEditSaveBar & InlineFieldInput

The record-level inline-edit session (#2407): double-clicking a field (or its
hover pencil) in the highlights strip or details body stages edits into ONE
shared draft (`InlineEditProvider` from `@object-ui/react`), committed by
`<InlineEditSaveBar>` as a single atomic OCC-guarded update. Polish shipped in
#2572:

- **Editors**: `InlineFieldInput` routes every field type to the same widget
  the form uses — including `number` / `currency` / `percent` (numeric
  keyboard, `min`/`max`/`step` from metadata, fraction↔percent conversion) and
  reference pickers, which receive `$expand`-ed record objects as-is so the
  display name renders without a hydration re-fetch.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: while the session is active, **Esc** cancels (open
  popovers/dialogs keep owning Escape for "close") and **Cmd/Ctrl+Enter**
  saves; both respect the in-flight `saving` and `locked` states.
- **Approval lock**: hosts pass `locked` / `lockedHint` to the save bar and
  gate `InlineEditProvider.canEdit` when the record is approval-locked, so a
  locked record hides its edit affordances instead of rejecting at Save.
- **Approval band & recall** (#6464): the band reads `approvalPending` /
  `approvalProgress` from the same provider, and offers its **Recall** button
  only where the click can succeed. Recall is the submitter's lever — the
  server authorizes it on submitter identity and refuses everyone else — so
  hosts that resolve approvals pass `InlineEditProvider.approvalIsSubmitter`.
  It is tri-state on purpose: `false` withdraws the button from a resolved
  non-submitter, `true` keeps it, and **omitting it leaves the button exactly
  as it was** — a host that resolves no approval identity is unchanged rather
  than losing its submitter's only unlock lever. It gates the affordance only;
  the recall endpoint remains the authority on who may actually recall.

## Reference Rail decision matrix

The "Reference Rail" is the right-hand column on the record detail page
that surfaces summary cards for related collections (similar to
Salesforce's **Related** rail and HubSpot's **About this record**
sidebar). It is rendered by the `record:reference_rail` component and
emits automatically when:

1. The page is generated by the synth (`buildDefaultPageSchema`) — i.e.
   no explicit `Page` overrides the object's detail view.
2. The objectDef declares **≥2 related collections** (lookup/master-detail
   inbound fields).
3. The viewport is **≥ xl (1280 px)** — below that the rail collapses and
   the **Related** tab keeps full coverage.
4. The synth call does **not** opt out via `hideReferenceRail`.

When the rail emits, the synth automatically suppresses the **Related**
tab so the same information isn't shown twice.

### Opting out

The opt-out is a `buildDefaultPageSchema` **option**, not an objectDef key:

```ts
import { buildDefaultPageSchema } from '@object-ui/plugin-detail';
import type { ObjectDefLike } from '@object-ui/plugin-detail';

declare const productDef: ObjectDefLike;

const page = buildDefaultPageSchema(productDef, {
  hideReferenceRail: true,  // hide the rail; restore the Related tab
  hideRelatedTab: true,     // (optional) force-hide the Related tab too
});
```

### CRM business-domain guidance

| Object type        | Rail   | Why                                                          |
|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hub objects        | **on** | Account / Opportunity / Contact / Case — users browse laterally to quotes, contacts, activities |
| Transactional      | **on** | Quote / Contract / Order — show line-items + related parties at a glance |
| Campaign / Event   | **on** | Members, responses, child campaigns                         |
| Catalog            | **off**| Product / Price Book — users edit attributes; lateral relationships are noise |
| Atomic action      | **off**| Task / Note — focused single-column edit beats a related-list rail |
| Lead (unconverted) | **off**| Pre-conversion records have no children — keep it focused on the form |

### Adding the rail to a custom `Page`

For explicit (non-synth) Pages, add an `aside` region after the `main`
region:

```ts
const asideRegion = {
  name: 'aside',
  width: 'small',
  className: 'hidden xl:flex flex-col gap-4',
  components: [
    {
      type: 'record:reference_rail',
      id: 'opp_reference_rail',
      properties: {
        entries: [
          { objectName: 'quote',                 relationshipField: 'opportunity', title: 'Quotes',     limit: 3 },
          { objectName: 'opportunity_line_item', relationshipField: 'opportunity', title: 'Products',   limit: 3 },
          { objectName: 'task',                  relationshipField: 'related_to_opportunity', title: 'Open Tasks', limit: 3 },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

The renderer reads `entries` from both `schema.entries` and
`schema.properties.entries` so either spec-style or flat authoring works.
