/**
 * objectui#6795 part C — what the studio-design pillars SAY when the designer
 * registries are unpopulated (维护者 2026-08-30, 第 5 场总监席决裁批 #4:「同意」).
 *
 * ## The mechanism these pins exist to hold
 *
 * `preview-registry` / `inspector-registry` / `default-inspector-registry` are
 * plain `Map`s filled by a module-scope side effect in
 * `views/metadata-admin/index.ts`, reached statically through the package
 * barrel. Every consumer reads them **during render, with no subscription** and
 * gets `undefined` when the registration has not run. Measured on the card:
 *
 *     fallback before registration: true
 *     still fallback after registration: true
 *     late inspector rendered: false
 *
 * ⇒ a consumer that reads an empty registry **never recovers**. That is why
 * every message pinned here states a fact and ⛔ never promises recovery — no
 * "loading…", no "try again", no spinner. Promising recovery would replace one
 * false statement with another. Making recovery real is part A of #6795, which
 * the ruling deferred to the maintainer's sequencing surface.
 *
 * ⛔ `Suspense` cannot repair any of this and must not be proposed: these are
 * synchronous reads returning `undefined`, and Suspense catches a *thrown
 * promise*. Triage fenced this explicitly; it is mechanical, not stylistic.
 *
 * ## Why the states are reachable at all
 *
 * They are unreachable in production **only by accident** — the eager
 * registration part A wants to remove is what keeps them so. That is precisely
 * why they can silently re-rot, and why they are pinned here rather than left
 * to the browser.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ This file must never register a designer
 *
 * Its whole subject is the empty-registry branch, so every test below asserts
 * the registries are empty FIRST — a zero that is not asserted is not a
 * reading. The populated-registry contrast lives in
 * {@link file://./StudioDesignSurface.designerRegistryPartial.test.tsx}, a
 * separate file because these `Map`s are module state shared by a whole file.

/* ── The `automation/_status` double (objectui#7307) ──────────────────
 * `AutomationsPillar` reads the engine's live per-flow runtime state from a
 * mount effect — the `flowStatus` effect in `StudioDesignSurface.tsx`, a bare
 * global `fetch` of `GET /api/v1/automation/_status` with no `apiFetch` seam on
 * the path. Under
 * happy-dom that global is a real HTTP client and the document URL defaults to
 * `http://localhost:3000`, so the relative path resolved to a live socket. The
 * effect's read is best-effort by construction (its `catch` comment: "offline /
 * older backend → no dots"), which is why the Automations case below stayed
 * green while the request always failed.
 *
 * Answered from a RECORDING double — the shape objectui#5225 settled on, carried
 * by `packages/plugin-report/src/__tests__/DatasetReportRenderer.test.tsx` and by
 * this burn-down's earlier batches. Deliberately NOT a blanket network stub: it
 * records every URL it is handed and `afterEach` fails on any URL outside the
 * route it serves, so an escape to somewhere else reds here instead of vanishing
 * into that `catch`.
 *
 * What it answers, and why that changes no assertion here: a known-EMPTY runtime
 * roster, in the `{ data: { flows: [...] } }` envelope the effect reads first
 * (it also accepts a bare `{ flows }`; both parse to the same rows). Empty is
 * load-bearing — the effect turns each row into a status DOT on the flow rail,
 * and the failing request left `flowStatus` at `{}` with no dots at all, so an
 * empty roster renders exactly what these cases have always rendered, while a
 * seeded one would add a dot for `nightly` to the Automations tableau this file
 * pins. Routes are matched on the PATHNAME; the full URL is what gets recorded.
