/**
 * `objectui check`'s positive schema marker (objectui#5127).
 *
 * A root `type` is not evidence that a file is a UI schema — `type` heads at
 * least seven unrelated JSON vocabularies, and the most common of them is
 * `package.json`'s `"type": "module"`. The command judged all of them, so the
 * FIRST line a user saw running it in their own project was a warning about
 * their own package manifest: 45 of the 46 warnings this repository produced
 * were exactly that.
 *
 * Half of this file pins that those files stopped being judged. The OTHER half
 * pins that real schemas are still judged and still warn — a suite that only
 * proved things went quiet would pass a change that deleted the feature, which
 * is the failure mode this gate is one step away from by construction.
 *
 * Fixtures live under `os.tmpdir()`, never in the repo tree: `check()` globs
 * every JSON file under the directory it is handed, so a fixture committed
 * inside this workspace would be scanned by every other run of the command as
 * well — including the repo's own `pnpm check`.
