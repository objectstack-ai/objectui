/**
 * The spec's `NavigationConfigSchema`, authoring side — by reference, with no
 * divergence of its own.
 *
 * This was a hand copy carrying the note "inline … to avoid importing from
 * @object-ui/types (which may not be a direct dependency of @object-ui/react)".
 * That reasoning is about the wrong package: the vocabulary belongs to
 * `@objectstack/spec`, which IS a direct dependency of this one — the same
 * expired "kept local to avoid a dependency" comment objectui#3169 found in
 * `@object-ui/app-shell`, where the dependency had likewise been there all
 * along. Check `package.json` before believing such a note (objectstack#4115).
 *
 * `mode` is OPTIONAL, because the spec says so and this hook agrees.
 * `packages/spec/src/ui/view.zod.ts` declares
 * `mode: NavigationModeSchema.default('page')`, and a `.default()` lands on the
 * AUTHORING side as `| undefined` — so `navigation: { view: 'summary_view' }`
 * is legal authored metadata that lets the mode default.
 *
 * Until objectui#4550 this alias `Omit`ted `mode` and re-added it as
 * `NonNullable<…>`, on the stated reasoning that "this hook dispatches on
 * `mode` and its callers always supply one". Both halves were false.
 * `useNavigationOverlay` does not require `mode` — it DEFAULTS it
 * (`navigation?.mode ?? 'page'`, ~140 lines below), and `'page'` is meaningful
 * behaviour rather than a placeholder. And callers did not always supply one:
 * `ListView` carried `schema.navigation as NavigationConfig | undefined` purely
 * to get a spec-shaped value past this declaration — a value the hook had
 * always been willing to take.
 *
 * The rule that makes this a producer-side fix rather than a caller-side one:
 * a type in front of an implementation must not be stricter than the
 * implementation. When it is, every caller pays in assertions, and an assertion
 * is exactly the renderer-side workaround AGENTS.md #0.1 sends back to the
 * producer. Here the producer was this line.
 *
 * `@object-ui/types` re-exports the spec's own `NavigationConfig` unchanged, so
 * that published name and this one now agree — they did not before, which is
 * how one monorepo shipped two `NavigationConfig`s that disagreed about whether
 * `mode` could be omitted. Pinned by
 * `__tests__/offline-nav-performance-spec-parity.test.ts` (the type) and
 * `__tests__/useNavigationOverlay.modeDefault.test.tsx` (the default behaviour
 * the relaxation rests on).
 *
 * Two per-key notes the hand copy carried, kept here because a derived alias
 * has no members to hang them on:
 *  - `size` is the coarse overlay bucket added by #2578; `resolveOverlayWidth`
 *    below maps it through {@link OVERLAY_SIZE_WIDTHS}.
 *  - `width` is DEPRECATED by #2578 in favour of `size`. It still wins when
 *    present, because app-shell pre-resolves `size` into it.
 */

 * the `size: 'auto'` field-count derivation this layer cannot perform (no
 * object schema here). Kept in lockstep by the spec-parity test.
 *
 * Before #2942 this hook only read the deprecated `width`, so an authored
 * `size` bucket was silently ignored by every host except app-shell (which
 * pre-resolves it before calling in).

/**
 * The overlay modes — the spec's own union, DERIVED since objectui#4167.
 *
 * rc.6 publishes `NavigationMode` (`z.input<typeof NavigationModeSchema>`), and
 * this alias resolved to exactly it already: `NavigationConfig['mode']` was then
 * `NonNullable<…['mode']>`, and stripping the `undefined` that the schema's
 * `.default()` puts on the authoring side leaves the seven-member enum itself.
 * So the spec reference was one hop away rather than absent — the alias just
 * reached it through a member access, which reads as a hand-written union to
 * `check:spec-symbols` and, more to the point, to a person.
 *
 * Bound to the spec directly instead: the seven members now arrive from the
 * schema that validates them. `__tests__/offline-nav-performance-spec-parity.test.ts`
 * pins that this stays the same type as `NonNullable<NavigationConfig['mode']>`,
 * so the two spellings cannot silently come apart if the spec ever stops
 * defaulting `mode` or defaults it on a narrower union.
 *
 * The `NonNullable` in that pin is objectui#4550's mark and is load-bearing:
 * `NavigationConfig` no longer strips the authoring-side `undefined`, so
 * `NavigationConfig['mode']` is `NavigationMode | undefined` and a bare
 * equality would now fail for a reason unrelated to the drift being guarded.
 * What stays pinned is the MEMBERSHIP — the seven modes this hook switches on
 * are exactly the seven the exported union publishes.

 * ## What to hand `objectName`
 *
 * The block's RECORD SOURCE — the object the clicked rows actually came from —
 * and never a bare top-level `schema.objectName` read in its place. objectui#6939
 * published `objectName` as the THIRD RUNG of one record-source ladder (`data`,
 * then `staticData`, then `objectName`), not as a parallel "page object"
 * concept, so a block has exactly ONE record source. `handleClick` below builds
 * the record-page URL `/{objectName}/record/{id}` out of whatever it is handed:
 * a caller that hands it the top-level key while its rows came from
 * `data.object` navigates to a record that the URL's own object does not
 * contain (objectui#7638).
 *
 * A caller that resolves a data config reads that ladder through the ONE shared
 * reader — `resolveRecordSourceObjectName` from `@object-ui/core`
 * (objectui#7627) — as the example does. A caller with NO data config has
 * nothing above rung three, and its `schema.objectName` already IS its record
 * source; that spelling is correct there and needs no conversion.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import {
 *   resolveRecordSourceConfig,
 *   resolveRecordSourceObjectName,
 * } from '@object-ui/core';
 *
 * const dataConfig = useMemo(() => resolveRecordSourceConfig(schema), [schema]);
 * const { handleClick, isOpen, selectedRecord, mode, close, width } =
 *   useNavigationOverlay({
 *     navigation: schema.navigation,
 *     objectName: resolveRecordSourceObjectName(schema, dataConfig),
 *     onNavigate: schema.onNavigate,
 *     onRowClick: props.onRowClick,
 *   });
 *
 * return (
 *   <>
 *     <DataTable onRowClick={handleClick} ... />
