 *    "object has-many view"). This is what this admin AUTHORS: see `anchors.ts`
 *    `createBuildBody` and the `view-create-body.test.ts` guard.
 *  - **Container** (`ViewSchema`) — the aggregated
 *    `{ name, label, object, list, form, listViews, formViews }`, still served
 *    for records that were never expanded into ViewItems.
 *
 * This validator used to name only the container. That looked harmless because
 * the container was non-strict: a ViewItem's `viewKind` / `config` were silently
 * STRIPPED, so every draft this admin creates "passed" without one of its own
 * keys ever being checked. Spec 17.0.0 made the container strict, turning that
 * vacuous pass into a loud rejection — which is how `createConformance.test.ts`
 * surfaced it during the 17.0.0-rc.2 uptake.
 *
 * So dispatch on the record's own discriminant rather than guessing: `viewKind`
 * is what makes a record a ViewItem HERE — see {@link isViewItemDraft} for what
 * that does and does not say about the read side. This is NOT a
 * tolerant fallback — neither shape is coerced or waved through, each is checked
 * strictly against its own schema. Which of the two should be the single
 * authorable shape is a real open question, tracked in objectui#3312.

/**
 * ── Union-failure diagnostics for the `view` gates (objectui#3606, #3626, #3678) ──
 *
 * PRESENTATION ONLY. Nothing below can change a verdict: it runs strictly
 * inside the final issue→`SchemaFormIssue` mapping, after `ok` has already been
 * decided by the one gate (`ViewMetadataSchema` on edit, the authoring schemas
 * on create) and after every issue filter has run. Same input set, same `ok`;
 * only the rendered `path`/`message` move.
 *
 * Three rules live here. This first block is the ROOT rule (#3606, edit gate
 * only — neither authoring schema has a union at its root); the two NESTED
 * rules follow below — the content rule for `config.columns` (#3626) and the
 * sole-candidate rule (#3678). The two nested rules read disjoint cells of one
 * partition; `nestedUnionMemberIndex` states and proves that.
 *
 * The edit gate is `z.preprocess(stripViewConsoleDecorations, z.union([…]))`.
 * Zod reports a union failure as a SINGLE root issue — `code: 'invalid_union'`,
 * `path: []`, `message: 'Invalid input'` — and buries each member's real
 * diagnostics in `issue.errors`, one group per member, in member order. Mapping
 * that root issue literally is what collapsed every field-level diagnostic on
 * the edit path into one un-addressable "Invalid input": `SchemaForm` highlights
 * by `path` and Monaco locates by `path`, so an empty path points at nothing,
 * and the guided messages the spec wrote for these rejections (#4001) never
 * reached the user.
 *
 * Selection is by the draft's OWN discriminant — the same `isViewItemDraft` the
 * create gate dispatches on — never by a heuristic over the groups. "Fewest
 * issues / deepest path" was measured and picks wrong: for a container carrying
 * an unknown key, the ViewItem group reports a deeper `viewKind` discriminator
 * error that is the wrong message entirely. We show ONLY the selected member's
 * issues; showing all four would put "this is not a container" in front of
 * someone editing a ViewItem.
 *
 * Measured member layout of `ViewMetadataSchema`'s union (@objectstack/spec
 * 17.0.0-rc.5):
 *
 *   [0] `ViewItemWireSchema`  — the stored ViewItem record (itself a
 *       discriminated union on `viewKind`; a valid discriminator resolves
 *       straight through, so its issues arrive flat and field-addressed).
 *   [1] the aggregated container — same shape as the exported `ViewSchema`.
 *   [2] flattened list-view overlay.
 *   [3] flattened form-view overlay.
 *
 * This indexes members POSITIONALLY, which couples to a spec-internal detail.
 * That coupling is deliberate and it is guarded, not hoped for: reading the
 * groups the failing gate itself produced is the only way the diagnostics
 * cannot describe a schema other than the one that judged. The alternative —
 * re-parsing with the exported member schemas — was measured and rejected: the
 * container member is NOT the exported `ViewSchema` object (equal shape today,
 * a resemblance maintained by hand), and a re-parse would also have to
 * re-apply `stripViewConsoleDecorations` itself, reconstructing the spec's
 * pipeline composition in a second place that can drift. The positional read
 * is pinned by the CANARY tests in `clientValidation.viewDiagnostics.test.ts`:
 * they assert the selected member's exact `path` + `message` for known bodies,
 * so reordering, adding or removing a union member turns them red instead of
 * silently mis-selecting.

/**
 * ── NESTED unions: the array-variant rule (objectui#3626) ──
 *
 * #3606 expanded the union at the ROOT only. `config.columns` is a union too —
 * `string[] | ColumnDef[]`, no discriminant — and it collapsed the same way, on
 * BOTH gates: create reported `config.columns` / `Invalid input` as a top-level
 * issue, edit reported it one level down inside the selected root member. The
 * user was taken to the right field and told nothing about it: not which
 * column, not which key, not what was expected.
 *
 * The discriminant here is the value's OWN CONTENT, which is the same class of
 * rule as the root's `viewKind` — a fact about what the author wrote, not a
 * comparison across error groups. A `columns` array is a list of field NAMES or
 * a list of column OBJECTS, and its first element says which. ("Fewest issues /
 * deepest path" remains banned: it ranks the groups against each other, and
 * #3606 measured it picking wrong.)
 *
 * Applying that naively to every nested union would mis-select, so the rule is
 * narrowed to unions that really are "an array of A or an array of B". Measured
 * over the whole `view` family (@objectstack/spec 17.0.0-rc.5), 16 nested
 * discriminant-less unions exist and `columns` is the only one whose members
 * are BOTH arrays. The neighbour that would break a naive rule is `config.sort`
 * (`string | ColumnSort[]`): for `sort: ['name']` the first element is a string,
 * so first-element-typeof alone would select the plain-`string` member and
 * report "expected string, received array" — technically true, and the wrong
 * thing to say to someone who correctly wrote an array. So a member that
 * rejected the value's TYPE at the union node itself (a bare `invalid_type` at
 * its own relative root) is not a candidate: it never looked at the contents,
 * so contents cannot be evidence for it. That single categorical test — asked
 * of each group on its own, never group-vs-group — is what keeps `sort`,
 * `filter[].value`, `gantt.tooltipFields[]` and the rest out of THIS rule.
 * (It kept them collapsed entirely until #3678, which reads the same test as a
 * census and answers the unions where it leaves exactly one member standing.
 * The narrowing above is unchanged and still load-bearing: delete the
 * `groups.some(memberRejectedNodeType)` line and the content rule elects the
 * plain-`string` member for `sort: ['name']` again.)
 *
 * Boundaries, all measured rather than assumed:
 *
 *  - `columns: []` is VALID under both members, so the empty array never
 *    reaches this code — the union succeeds and there is no issue to expand.
 *    The "what do we do with an empty array" question is structurally moot.
 *  - `columns: [42]` / `[null]` — the first element names neither variant, so
 *    nothing is selected and the node keeps Zod's own message. Both members
 *    reject it identically anyway; picking one would be inventing a preference.
 *  - `columns: 'nope'` — not an array, nothing to discriminate on. (Both
 *    members do agree here, but "all members said the same thing so promote it"
 *    is a different mechanism — issue #3626's direction 1 — not this one.)
 *  - Mixed arrays are the interesting case and they come out right: for
 *    `['name', {field: 1}]` the first element elects `string[]`, which reports
 *    `config.columns.1` — the element that actually broke the list the author
 *    was writing — instead of the object member's two rejections of the shape
 *    they never chose.
 *
 * Like the root rule this indexes members POSITIONALLY and is pinned the same
 * way: the CANARY tests assert the exact `path` + `message` of the selected
 * member, so a spec-side reorder of the `columns` union's two members goes red
 * instead of silently reporting the other variant's complaint.

 * This single test is the basis of BOTH nested rules (see
 * `nestedUnionMemberIndex`): #3626 uses it to decide which unions the content
 * rule may speak about, #3678 counts it to find a union with exactly one
 * candidate. A member that answers `true` here never read the value, so nothing
 * about the value can be evidence for or against it.
 *
 * Only `invalid_type` counts, and objectui#3694 MEASURED that this is the right
 * line rather than an implementation detail that leaked into the semantics.
 *
 * Zod answers `invalid_value` — not `invalid_type` — whenever an enum or a
 * literal rejects, whatever the input's type. Across the whole `view` family
 * exactly two union sites ever produce `invalid_value` at a member's own root:
 * `columns[].summary` (`enum | {type, field}`) and `sections[].columns`
 * (`enum | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4`). Widening this predicate to count `invalid_value`
 * as a node-level rejection was measured over 51 shapes and is NOT an
 * improvement — it is a TRADE on one union:
 *
 *   summary is an OBJECT (`{type:'bogus'}`, `{}`, `{type,field}`)
 *     today k=2 → collapsed `…summary` / `Invalid input`
 *     widened k=1 → `…summary.type` / the option list          ← 5 shapes GAINED
 *   summary is a non-enum SCALAR (`42`, `true`, `null`, `[]`, `['count']`, …)
 *     today k=1 → the enum is the sole candidate, `…summary` / the option list
 *     widened k=0 → `…summary` / `Invalid input`               ← 8 shapes LOST
 *
 * The loss includes the #3678 CANARY `summary: 'bogus'`. A type-aware variant
 * (categorical only when no allowed literal shares the value's `typeof`) was
 * measured too and merely re-cuts the same trade: 6 gained, 6 lost. So neither
 * qualification of `invalid_value` dominates, and #3694 declined both. Both
 * directions are pinned in the test file's #3694 block, so an attempt to widen
 * this predicate goes red on the shapes it would damage instead of shipping
 * them silently — four of them are pinned nowhere else.
 *
 * Measured with the same run: widening cannot move the CONTENT rule's reach at
 * all. That rule needs two members AND a non-empty array value, and at the one
 * shape satisfying both (`summary: ['count']`) the object member answers
 * `invalid_type`, so `groups.some(memberRejectedNodeType)` is already true and
 * stays true. The whole question lives in the sole-candidate rule.
 *
 * The contract-first fix remains spec-side (objectstack#6391): a union that
 * declares its own discriminant needs none of this census.

 * and not a preference — it is the only member that ever read the value, so it
 * is the only member whose complaint can be about what the author wrote. The
 * other members objected to the value's TYPE and stopped there; showing their
 * complaints would describe a shape the author never chose.
 *
 * `config.sort` (`string | ColumnSort[]`) is the case that motivated it. For
 * `sort: [{field: 'n', order: 'bogus'}]` the plain-`string` member rejects the
 * array outright and the `ColumnSort[]` member reports
 * `[0].order` / `Invalid option: expected one of "asc"|"desc"` — the spec's own
 * guided message (#4001), which until now was thrown away and rendered as
 * `config.sort` / `Invalid input`.
 *
 * This rule does NOT index members positionally: the index is derived from the
 * census of the groups the failing gate itself produced, so a spec-side reorder
 * of a union's members cannot mis-select. What a spec change CAN do is move a
 * union between cells — adding a third `sort` member that also accepts arrays
 * would take the census from one candidate to two and collapse the node back to
 * `Invalid input`. That is why the #3678 anchors pin exact paths + messages:
 * the loss shows up as a red test rather than as a quietly worse message.
 *
 * Reach, measured over the `view` family rather than assumed — this is WIDER
 * than issue #3678 estimated. #3678's "范围" paragraph expected only
 * scalar-or-array two-member unions such as `sort` to be reachable, and read
 * `filter[].value` / `sections[].fields[]` as rejecting wholesale. They do
 * reject wholesale for a scalar value, but not for an ARRAY value, where the
 * array member is the sole candidate:
 *
 *   `filter[0].value: [{}]`        → `config.filter.0.value.0` (was `…value`)
 *   `sections[0].fields: [{}]`     → `config.sections.0.fields.0.field`
 *   `columns[0].summary: 'bogus'`  → same path, now the enum's option list

 * instead of `Invalid input` — and each is pinned below. Two of them supersede

 * ── The original reason has EXPIRED. The boundary has NOT. (objectui#6982) ──
 *
 * This block used to read: measured on `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0-rc.5,
 * `SharingRuleSchema` declares NONE of the 7 envelope keys and is `.strict()`,
 * so it is the one shape that must not judge a stored body. The contract-first
 * repair it was waiting for LANDED. Re-measured on the resolved spec 17.2.0,
 * `SharingRuleSchema` declares all 7 (`_lock`, `_lockReason`, `_lockSource`,
 * `_provenance`, `_packageId`, `_packageVersion`, `_lockDocsUrl`) — envelope
 * keys MISSING: none. A `_packageId`-stamped body is legal input now, and
 * `clientValidation.optOuts.test.ts` already pins the create door accepting it.
 *
 * ⛔ That does NOT make this opt-out removable, and the next person to re-read
 * the envelope and conclude it does should read the measurement below first.
 *
 * A served body carries more than the envelope. The metadata read path
 * DECORATES every item it serves with `_diagnostics` (`decorateMetadataItem`,
 * whenever the type has a registered Zod schema — `sharing_rule` has one), and
 * the spec names that key a READ DECORATION precisely so it is *not* allowlisted
 * the way the envelope is: `kernel/metadata-read-decorations.ts` states that a
 * served body "is therefore NOT a valid input to the schema that produced it
 * until these are removed". `SharingRuleSchema` is still `.strict()`, so it
 * rejects our own annotation with `unrecognized_keys` at the ROOT — a path
 * length the `serverSchema.required` root-cure below cannot reach (it only
 * suppresses ABSENT top-level fields, `path.length === 1`).
 *
 * Measured on the real read path (objectstack protocol over a real engine —
 * save, then read back):
 *
 *   GET .../sharing_rule/:name            item keys += `_diagnostics`  -> REJECT
 *   GET .../sharing_rule/:name?state=draft item keys += `_diagnostics` -> REJECT
 *   layered `effective` (RAW, undecorated)                             -> ACCEPT
 *
 * `ResourceEditPage` builds its edit draft as `{...layered.effective,
 * ...client.getDraft().item}` and strips nothing — so for any sharing rule with
 * a PENDING DRAFT the gate would report a body the server accepts as broken.
 * The server, by contrast, strips read decorations on the way in and never
 * re-parses stored rows through this registry at all. That is the
 * objectstack#5316 inversion wearing a different key, and it is the same defect
 * class the framework has already paid for twice (a served `_diagnostics` 400ing
 * every saved dataset; the cold-boot flow bind, cloud#971).
 *
 * So the type stays wired on `create` — the AUTHORING door, which is exactly
 * where a permissive match-all sharing condition gets written — and deliberately
 * not on `edit`. This is NOT a tolerant fallback: nothing is coerced and no
 * draft is waved through; one door has a client gate and the other keeps the
 * server's. Turning this gate on is gated on the `_diagnostics` ingress being
 * closed first (the strip belongs where the draft is assembled, not here —
 * reconstructing the decoration list in this file would be a second de-facto
 * contract). Until then a gate here would refuse legitimate author input, which
 * is worse than the defense-in-depth gap it closes.

  // `view` is the one type whose two doors need two gates (objectstack#5316).
  //
  // CREATE — the authoring gate, unchanged: `viewSchemaForDraft` dispatches on
  // the record's own `viewKind` discriminant to `ViewItemSchema` (what
  // `createBuildBody` emits) or `ViewSchema` (the container). #5074 made these
  // strict on purpose and this admin's create path passes them cleanly.
  //
  // EDIT — the WIRE gate. The editor opens a body that came back out of
  // `sys_metadata`, and a stored view body carries keys the PLATFORM wrote:
  // `isPinned` (the view switcher's pin action, `ObjectView.tsx:882`),
  // `sortOrder` (the reorder write, `ObjectView.tsx:931`), and — nested —
  // the console filter/sort builders' per-row `id`. `updateView` GETs the
  // stored item and PUTs `{ ...current, ...partial }`; `saveMetaItem` persists
  // the accepted body verbatim (ADR-0005 §Validation). So the server ACCEPTS
  // this body — it validates against `ViewMetadataSchema` — while the authoring
  // gate rejects it. Judging a stored body by the authoring schema made the
  // client strictly stricter than the server; that is the inversion #5316 fixes.
  //
  // Why `ViewMetadataSchema` and not the narrower `ViewItemWireSchema`, which
  // also declares `isPinned`/`sortOrder`: two measured reasons.
  //   1. It is the schema the `view` metadata type registers, i.e. literally
  //      the one `saveMetaItem` runs — so client and server accept the same
  //      set by construction rather than by a maintained resemblance.
  //   2. `ViewItemWireSchema` covers only the ViewItem record. It rejects the
  //      container and the flattened overlay, and — measurably — still rejects
  //      `config.filter[].id` with `unrecognized_keys`, because that decoration
  //      is stripped by `ViewMetadataSchema`'s `z.preprocess`, which runs ahead
  //      of every union member and reaches nested blocks a member-level
  //      `.strip()` cannot.
  //
  // NOT a "try both, pass if either passes" fallback: each mode has exactly ONE
  // gate and a rejection is final. The last pins in
  // `clientValidation.viewShapes.test.ts` guard that.
