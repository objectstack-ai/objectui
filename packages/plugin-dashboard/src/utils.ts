/**
 * Resolve a chart series label — the SINGLE authority both dashboard relays
 * (`DashboardRenderer`, `DashboardGridLayout`) call, so the three-arm decision
 * below lives once instead of as two copies that could drift.
 *
 * Originated as a `DashboardRenderer`-local `useCallback` (objectui#9055,
 * which fixed arms 2 and 3 there). `DashboardGridLayout` composed
 * `series: [{ dataKey }]` with no `label` key on either of its branches — the
 * legend and tooltip rendered the raw field key while the sibling relay's
 * chart for the same widget rendered the humanized one (objectui#9172). That
 * card is what moved this here rather than growing a second copy of the
 * three-arm logic: a helper duplicated across the two relays is exactly the
 * "one value, two spellings" class objectui#5425 ruled out.
 *
 * ⭐ THREE ARMS, and only the last two derive a display string from a FIELD
 * KEY:
 *
 *   arm 1  synthetic y-field ('value' / 'count' / '') + an aggregate function
 *          -> an i18n'd aggregate name (Count / Sum / Average …), so a
 *          fieldless count aggregate doesn't leak the placeholder 'value' /
 *          'count' string into the legend / tooltip.
 *   arm 2  a real object + a real field -> `fieldLabel`'s bundle lookup, with
 *          the HUMANIZED key (not the raw one) as its fallback.
 *   arm 3  no object name at all (a static-data chart) -> the humanized key
 *          outright.
 *
 * `t` and `fieldLabel` are injected rather than the hooks themselves, so this
 * stays a plain function callable from either relay's own
 * `useObjectTranslation()` / `useObjectLabel()` instances — no shared hook
 * identity to manage, and each relay keeps memoizing its own `useCallback`
 * wrapper over this (objectui#10's caution against depending on a memo's
 * IDENTITY is about correctness, not about composing plain functions like
 * this one).

 *
 * `DataTableSchema.columns` is a REQUIRED key (`@object-ui/types`
 * `data-display.ts`), and a `data-table` handed rows but no columns draws one
 * empty `tr` per row: no `th`, no `td`, nothing readable. Both dashboard
 * surfaces built exactly that node whenever the widget carried only
 * `options.data`, so a documented authoring surface rendered a silent blank.
 *
 * The object-bound half of the same widget family has always derived columns
 * from the fetched rows when none were declared (`ObjectDataTable`), so this is
 * that behaviour reaching the static half — not a new capability. Keys come
 * from the FIRST row for the same reason it does there: the first record is the
 * shape the author is describing, and scanning every row would let one ragged
 * record widen the table.
 *
 * `_`-prefixed keys are internal bookkeeping and stay out. Non-record rows
 * (strings, numbers, arrays) have no keys to name, so they derive nothing and
 * the table renders its own empty state rather than a header row of noise.
