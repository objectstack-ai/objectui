/**
 * objectui#6041 — `MetadataService` writes the relationship target under the
 * spec's spelling `reference`, never `referenceTo`.
 *
 * Surfaced by the key-level parity gate built for objectui#5761
 * (`scripts/check-designer-field-key-parity.mjs`). `FieldMetadataPayload` is
 * one of that gate's two `wire` shapes: `toFieldPayload` builds it and
 * `saveFields` PUTs `fields.map(toFieldPayload)` to
 * `PUT /api/v1/meta/object/:name`.
 *
 * `referenceTo` is not in `FieldSchema`'s accept set. Measured against the
 * installed `@objectstack/spec` 17.2.0, both at field level and through the
 * whole object document:
 *
 *   ObjectSchema.safeParse({ …, fields: { rel: { type: 'lookup', label: 'Owner',
 *                                               referenceTo: 'user' } } })
 *     => success = false
 *     => unrecognized_keys at ["fields","rel"] keys=["referenceTo"]
 *        "Did you mean `referenceTo` -> `reference`?"
 *
 * which the route returns as a hard 422 `INVALID_METADATA`. Because the key is
 * then STORED, every later save of that object fails the same way until it is
 * cleared by hand.
 *
 * ## Why the negative controls are the deliverable
 *
 * A green parity assertion proves nothing on its own: `FieldSchema` could be
 * resolved to a look-alike or loosened to a passthrough and every positive
 * assertion here would stay green while the 422 still happened server-side. So
 * the instrument is asserted first, and each positive claim is paired with a
 * control that must fail.
 *
 * Assertions are made on the bytes the SDK actually PUT — `JSON.parse` of the
 * captured request body — not on the object handed to the client. That
 * distinction is load-bearing for this key: a property whose value is
 * `undefined` is a key that zod's strict object COUNTS but that
 * `JSON.stringify` DROPS, so an in-memory assertion and a wire assertion
 * disagree exactly on the half-filled draft this card had to measure.
