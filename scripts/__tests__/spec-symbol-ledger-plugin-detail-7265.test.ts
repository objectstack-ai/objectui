/**
 * objectui#7265, the `@object-ui/plugin-detail` slice -- the LAST group, and the
 * one whose landing leaves rule 1's `DEBT` block empty for the first time since
 * objectui#6291 re-seeded it.
 *
 * Sibling of `spec-symbol-ledger-core-7265.test.ts`,
 * `spec-symbol-ledger-app-shell-7265.test.ts`,
 * `spec-symbol-ledger-types-7265.test.ts`,
 * `spec-symbol-ledger-components-7265.test.ts` and
 * `spec-symbol-ledger-data-objectstack-7265.test.ts`, same two-part shape,
 * because a ledger needs both halves:
 *
 *   1. THE SITE. The real scanner, run over the real file. This is the half that
 *      reds if a local copy comes back -- deleting a name from a ledger is not a
 *      burn-down unless the declaration went with it.
 *   2. THE BLOCK. Shrink-only is the card's own invariant, so it is asserted,
 *      not just respected. This slice is the one that can finally state it as an
 *      equality, because the floor and the ceiling have met.
 *
 * ...plus two halves that belong to nobody else, because nothing after this
 * slice will be in a position to add them:
 *
 *   3. THE EMPTY-LEDGER PATH, live for the first time. `DEBT`, `DEBT_ISSUE` and
 *      the ratchet that reads them are the guard against RE-SEEDING, so an empty
 *      ledger is the end state rather than the cue to delete the machinery.
 *   4. THE STALE-ENTRY MESSAGE's wording. That message is quoted into pull
 *      requests by design on this card; the reason its wording is constrained is
 *      written at the ratchet that emits it, and this is what makes the
 *      constraint fail loudly instead of being remembered.
 *
 * WHY THE ROUTE WAS RENAME, in one line: at the resolved pin the spec's
 * `RecordAlertProps` is the AUTHORED property bag of the `record:alert` block,
 * while the local declaration was the React props its RENDERER is called with --
 * the spec's bag nested one level down inside it. Different concepts under one
 * name, and the directory's other renderers already spell the difference.
 *
 * ⚠️ The scanner is only evidence if it can fail, so every site reading here is
 * paired with a fixture of the same kind that it MUST flag. A green scan with an
 * empty `specNames` map, or over a path that does not exist, looks exactly like
 * a green scan over a burned-down site.
