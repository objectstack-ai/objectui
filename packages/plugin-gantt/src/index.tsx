/**
 * What `ObjectGantt` reads for its own query: `objectName` (via `getDataConfig`,
 * which turns it into the `provider: 'object'` config the fetch resolves its
 * `resource` from), `filter` and `sort` (`ObjectGantt.tsx` —
 * `$filter: schema.filter`, `$orderby: convertSortToQueryParams(schema.sort)`).
 *
 * `columns` and a row cap are NOT mapped, because neither has a read site: a
 * gantt projects the fields its `gantt` config names (start/end/title/progress/
 * dependencies/…) rather than a column list, and the `$top` its reload does
 * send is the platform ceiling — a named constant, ⛔ not authorable
 * (objectui#7210, ruling a′). Writing a view's field list or page size onto
 * either key would hand the block a value it ignores, which is the defect this
 * wiring removes, one layer deeper. ⚠️ This paragraph used to say the reload
 * "issues no `$top` at all"; that stopped being true at objectui#7210 and is
 * corrected here because objectui#8769 puts the same `$top` on one more path.
 *
 * Inline data still WINS: `getDataConfig` prefers `schema.data` /
 * `schema.staticData` over the object name, so a gantt authored with both a
 * binding and inline rows renders the inline rows. ⚠️ It no longer renders
 * them UNPROCESSED — objectui#8769 routes the inline provider through the same
 * adapter query as every other provider, so a `filter` / `sort` mapped here
 * narrows and orders inline rows exactly as it does fetched ones, and the row
 * ceiling applies to them too.

/**
 * ⛔ The bare `gantt` node type key is RETIRED (objectui#8008, maintainer
 * ruling 2026-09-09, route 3). `object-gantt` is the one spelling this plugin
 * serves.
 *
 * ## What was here, and why it went
 *
 * `ComponentRegistry.register('gantt', ObjectGanttRenderer, { namespace:
 * 'view', ... })` — a second key on the SAME renderer, which stored both
 * `view:gantt` and the bare `gantt` fallback. The declared face admitted only
 * one of the two: `ObjectGanttSchema.type` is the literal `'object-gantt'`, so
 * an author who annotated their node could not write the key the registry
 * accepted (`TS2322`), while an author who left the literal bare got no
 * checking at all. Two published faces, opposite verdicts.
 *
 * ## Why unregistering is the whole retirement here — measured, not assumed
 *
 * ⚠️ `BaseSchema` closes with `[key: string]: any` and `BaseSchemaCore` ends
 * `.passthrough()`, so a dropped MEMBER KEY is KEPT, not refused (the
 * objectui#7664 failure). That hazard does not reach a TYPE NAME on this
 * surface, and the reason is structural rather than lucky: no schema face in
 * `@object-ui/types` ever declared `gantt` as a component node type — measured
 * whole-repo, zero declarations, against a firing control of two for
 * `object-gantt` (`objectql.ts` + its Zod mirror). There is no arm to convert
 * into a named refusal, so unregistering IS the retirement.
 *
 * ⇒ Registration-only retirement. Contrast the `kanban` sibling in the same
 * batch (objectui#8802), which DID have a declared arm and therefore got a
 * named refusal rather than a deletion.
 *
 * ## ⛔ Two layers, and only one of them moved
 *
 * The string `gantt` also names a STORED `NamedListView.type` — the value
 * `CreateViewDialog` writes and every tenant's database holds. That layer is
 * untouched: `packages/plugin-view/src/ObjectView.tsx`'s `switch (viewType)`
 * maps the stored `gantt` view type onto the node type it emits, and it already
 * emits `object-gantt`. ⇒ Every gantt view any user ever created through the
 * console already renders through the surviving spelling; this retirement moves
 * zero stored documents.
 *
 * Pinned in `src/__tests__/bare-gantt-node-key-retired-8008.test.ts`.
