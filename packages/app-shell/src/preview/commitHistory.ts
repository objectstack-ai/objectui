/**
 * ADR-0067 — package-scoped commit history reads/writes for the timeline.
 *
 * Each AI build (and Studio batch) lands as one revertible COMMIT on top of
 * the metadata history. The history-not-confirm model: you don't approve each
 * publish — you review this timeline and revert if a change was wrong. These
 * helpers read the timeline (`GET /packages/:id/commits`) and revert one
 * commit (`POST /packages/:id/commits/:cid/revert`). Cookie-authenticated like
 * every console call; tolerant of the `{ data: ... }` / bare envelope shapes.
 *
 * ## Failures carry their KIND, not just a number (objectui#3529)
 *
 * Both calls used to flatten every non-OK response to `commits HTTP {status}` /
 * `HTTP {status}`. Correctness was never the gap — the throw is real, rendering
 * stops, and no fictional "no history" is ever shown, which is why
 * objectstack#5980 (ADR-0110 D3) needed no follow-up on this path. What was lost
 * is the MEANING the backend already sends, on the one screen where it matters
 * most: this is the ROLLBACK surface, read by an operator who is usually
 * mid-incident.
 *
 * A `503` is not a `404`. It says the commit store could not be reached, so the
 * call did not happen and the state is UNKNOWN — retry. A `404` says the store
 * answered, and the answer was "no". Those two get different dispositions from
 * an operator, so they get different presentations here.
 *
 * ### Which field actually carries the code
 *
 * The ADR-0112 envelope spells the semantic code at **`error.code`**:
 *
 * ```json
 * { "success": false,
 *   "error": { "code": "SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE", "message": "…", "httpStatus": 503 } }
 * ```
 *
 * objectui#3529's body points at `details.code`. Verified against the producer,
 * that is the SERVER-INTERNAL carrier only: `HttpDispatcher.errorFromThrown`
 * builds `details: { code: e.code }`, and `buildApiError`/`splitSemanticCode`
 * (objectstack `packages/runtime/src/error-envelope.ts`, objectstack-ai/objectstack#3842) then LIFT that
 * code into `error.code` and drop `details` entirely when it held nothing else.
 * So `details.code` never reaches the browser from this producer, and a consumer
 * reading it would be running a check that can only ever pass vacuously. We read
 * the declared field instead, and no alias chain beside it — a tolerant read of
 * a shape this endpoint does not send is exactly the consumer-side leniency
 * Prime Directive #12 removes.
 *
 * ### The envelope's `message` is NOT usable for this class
 *
 * The card also expects the 503's prose to say "unknown". It does not reach the
 * browser: `declaresServerFault` (objectstack `packages/types/src/error-leak.ts`,
 * objectstack-ai/objectstack#5811) is true for exactly this error — `status >= 500` WITH a string `code` —
 * so the dispatcher replaces the sentence with the generic
 * `INTERNAL_ERROR_MESSAGE` ("Internal server error") while `error.code` survives.
 * Rendering the envelope message here would therefore show an operator a generic
 * string and lose the status too. For the unreachable class the copy is authored
 * on THIS side; the envelope message is preferred only for the statuses where it
 * is not withheld (4xx), which is what keeps a 404 reading differently from a 500.
 *
 * ### Status decides first, on purpose
 *
 * Classification keys on `res.status` and treats the envelope code as a second
 * signal. A 503 does not always come from the application: a proxy or gateway
 * shedding load answers 503 with an HTML body and no envelope at all. The
 * operator's disposition must not depend on whether a body parsed, so status
 * alone is sufficient to produce the retryable reading.
 */

/**
 * A commit-store call that failed, carrying enough for a caller to tell the
 * dispositions apart without re-parsing anything.
 *
 * `retryable` is deliberately NOT "any 5xx". A `500` is the server saying it
 * broke while doing the work — whether the work happened is not something a
 * retry answers — and objectui#3529 names 404, 500 and 503 as three
 * presentations that must stay distinguishable. Only the unreachable class
 * (`503` / `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`) means "this did not happen".
