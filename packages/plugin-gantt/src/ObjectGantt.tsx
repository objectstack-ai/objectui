 * `exportFileName`, `interactions` — were lifted into `@object-ui/types`, because

/**
 * The members this renderer states ON TOP of {@link GanttConfig} — twelve, as
 * measured against the shipped `GanttConfig` on `main` (objectui#6471; the card
 * counted eleven before objectui#6051/#6472 landed part of the lift).
 *
 * All twelve RESTATE a key `GanttConfig` already declares, and since
 * objectstack#15469 closed the schema all twelve — `timeSegments` included —
 * arrive from the spec's `GanttConfigSchema` (29 keys); every one is mutually
 * assignable with its twin. That includes
 * `quickFilters` and `timeSegments`, which objectui#6471 called load-bearing
 * NARROWINGS: measured on `main` they narrow nothing. What those two still do is
 * NAME this plugin's runtime types (`QuickFilterDef[]` /
 * {@link ShiftSegmentsConfig}), so a spec bump that moves either side surfaces as
 * a decision. `ObjectGantt.configPin.test.ts` holds that measurement — read it
 * there rather than re-deriving it here.
 *
 * ## Why a member is kept rather than deleted — TWO reasons, either sufficient
 *
 * 1. PROSE, where there is any. The spec emits no per-member docs
 *    (`z.input<typeof GanttConfigSchema>` carries none) and JSDoc cannot be
 *    attached to a member a type merely inherits, so for most members the
 *    docblock below is the fullest description of what this renderer DOES with
 *    the key. It does NOT reach every member: four are bare here —
 *    `parentField`, `baselineEndField`, `assigneeField`, `effortField` — the last
 *    three covered by a neighbour's docblock, `parentField` by nothing. Nor is
 *    this prose unique any more: since objectui#6472 the flattened face
 *    (`ObjectGanttSchema` in `@object-ui/types`) documents all twelve, and
 *    objectui#6561 expanded `parentField`'s entry there.
 *
 * 2. PIN OPERAND — this reason reaches EVERY member, and for `parentField` it is
 *    the only one. The pin below is derived over `keyof GanttConfigRestated`: a
 *    member that exists is compared against its twin, and a member that is
 *    deleted simply stops being compared.
 *
 * ⛔ So the test for whether a member may be deleted is NOT "does it carry its
 * own JSDoc". Applied to `parentField` that test answers "deletable", and it is
 * wrong. Deleting `parentField` is not silent — it fails three assertions in
 * `ObjectGantt.configPin.test.ts`: the `RESTATED` census, the non-vacuity control
 * that names it, and the fixture. But all three fail INSIDE the pin, which is the
 * file a reader edits to turn a red build green; follow those errors and the tree
 * goes green with one member fewer under the pin. Delete a member here only when
 * its twin on `GanttConfig` goes with it.
 *
 * ⚠️ NAMED rather than inlined into the intersection above, and that is the
 * whole mechanism: inside `GanttConfigEx` there is nothing left to compare,
 * because `GanttConfigEx[K]` is ALREADY `GanttConfig[K] & <local>[K]` and is
 * therefore assignable to `GanttConfig[K]` by construction — an assertion written
 * against `GanttConfigEx` passes no matter how far the two declarations drift.
 * Naming the local half is what gives `ObjectGantt.configPin.test.ts` two
 * independent operands, so a spec bump that re-types one of the twelve breaks the
 * build at the pin instead of silently intersecting the old type back in.

  // Default to a right-side drawer so clicking a task opens an editable

  //
  // No width is spelled here on purpose. `width` is `@deprecated [#2578 ->
  // size]` in the spec that owns this shape, and `resolveOverlayWidth` gives
  // an explicit `width` priority OVER `size` — so spelling it kept the
  // deprecated branch load-bearing on the path most gantts take (no declared
  // `navigation`), and made the size buckets unreachable there. Omitting both
  // leaves `resolveOverlayWidth` returning `undefined`, which is what
  // RecordDetailDrawer's own `width` default is for; that default is the
  // identical `min(960px, 60vw)`, so this is a zero-pixel change on every
  // viewport. Pinned by ObjectGantt.navWidthDefault.test.tsx — both halves,
  // because the equivalence now depends on the drawer's default too.
  //
  // Deliberately NOT converged on `size: 'lg'`: that bucket is
  // `min(92vw, 960px)`, which agrees with the above only at viewport >=
  // 1600px and is up to 53% wider below it. Whether the renderers should move
  // to the bucket was asked here (#6259) and then carried across
  // kanban/calendar/RecordDetailDrawer as one decision (#6303); both of those
  // cards closed on their `width` half, and the bucket half was RULED AGAINST
  // on its own card: objectui#6584, 2026-08-27 — stays on the CSS literal; no
  // bucket convergence. All four surfaces keep today's pixels. The question is
  // CLOSED, not open — do not re-open it as a cleanup. If bucket-vocabulary
  // unification ever becomes a product direction that is a fresh ruling, with
  // visual-regression evidence across all four surfaces in one stroke.

  // objectui#7334 — the NON-OVERLAY half of an authored `navigation`, and the
  // reason this component needed one at all.
  //
  // `useNavigationOverlay` routes a click three ways once the mode is known:
  // it owns the four overlay modes itself; `new_window` calls `onNavigate` and
  // otherwise falls through to a `window.open`; and `page` calls `onNavigate`
  // and then **returns with no fallback**. This component supplied no
  // `onNavigate`, and its own registration hands it no host `onRowClick`
  // either (`ObjectGanttRenderer` forwards `schema` and `dataSource` only —
  // objectui#7210 / objectui#7222). So `page` had BOTH carriers empty at once.
  //
  // That was invisible until the sibling half of objectui#7334 started
  // forwarding the authored `navigation` down the gantt view-schema path: the
  // mode was unreachable before, and reaching it turned an authored
  // `{ mode: 'page' }` from "a drawer opens, which is the wrong thing" into "a
  // click does nothing at all". A silent dead click is worse than a loud wrong
  // one, so the sink lands on the same card rather than as a follow-up.
  //
  // ⛔ NOT a host prop forwarded to the chart. Nothing is taken from
  // `ObjectGanttRenderer`, no `{...props}` is spread anywhere, and
  // objectui#7210 half 2 stays untouched and unruled. The destination is the
  // one this component ALREADY computes for the drawer's full-page link, so a
  // `page` click and the drawer's "open full page" affordance cannot diverge.
  //
  // ⚠️ `recordDetailHref` is row-based, not id-based, because a mixed-object
  // gantt (`ganttConfig.objectField`) routes a row to ITS OWN object rather
  // than the view's — the id alone cannot answer which object a row belongs
  // to. The hook hands back only the record id, so the row is looked up again
  // here; when it cannot be found the view's own object is the honest
  // fallback, which is exactly what a single-object gantt always resolves to.
  //
  // Same-tab navigation uses the history + `popstate` pair rather than
  // `location.assign`, matching `DashboardRenderer` and `PageHeader`: every
  // href `deriveRecordPageHref` builds is app-relative, so a full document
  // load would throw away the SPA it is navigating inside.
