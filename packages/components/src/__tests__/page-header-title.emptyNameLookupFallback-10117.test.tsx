/**
 * objectui#10117 — `page:header` crashed with React #31 ("Objects are not
 * valid as a React child") when the record's declared name field was empty.
 *
 * ## The defect, in one sentence
 *
 * `PageHeaderRenderer`'s record-chrome branch asks the unified ADR-0079
 * resolver (`getRecordDisplayName`) with `deriveFromRecordKeys: false`, and
 * then RE-SPELLS that resolver's skipped record-key rung itself as a raw
 * `data?.name || data?.full_name || data?.title || data?.subject || …` chain.
 * Raw `||` reads the field's stored value, so for a `lookup` the truthy value
 * is the EXPANDED REFERENCE OBJECT — which went straight into JSX.
 *
 * ⭐ The control that proves the resolution already exists in this tree: the
 * breadcrumb resolves the SAME record through `getRecordDisplayName` WITHOUT
 * `deriveFromRecordKeys: false`, so its record-key rung runs through
 * `recordDisplayValueAt` -> `displayNameOfEmbeddedObject` and shows the
 * lookup's display name. The header did not crash for want of a resolver; it
 * crashed for having a second, raw copy of the walk.
 *
 * `recordDisplayValueAt`'s own header (objectui#8350) already ruled this
 * class: "Do not re-spell this test at a call site". This header was the
 * remaining re-spelling.
 *
 * ## What each pin holds — and what ABLATION showed about that
 *
 * Measured, not assumed: restoring the raw walk while KEEPING the defensive
 * stringify left pins 1 and 2 GREEN. The backstop resolves an expanded
 * reference through the very same `displayNameOfEmbeddedObject`, so for a
 * lookup it produces a byte-identical heading. ⇒ "did not crash" and "the
 * display name is on screen" are held by clause 1 OR clause 3, and neither
 * pin can tell the two apart. Pins 3 and 5 are the ones that separate them,
 * and they exist because that ablation came back green.
 *
 *  1. THE CRASH — empty `name` + a lookup candidate must not throw.
 *  2. THE DISPLAY NAME — the resolved name must be ON SCREEN. A pin that only
 *     checked for absence of a throw would pass on a header rendering
 *     `[object Object]`, so absence-of-throw is deliberately not the assertion.
 *  3. CLAUSE 2, isolated — the borrowable value is a non-empty STRING, so no
 *     defensive stringify can save it; only refusing the hop keeps it off the
 *     H1. 3b covers the whitespace-only half of the same rule.
 *  5. CLAUSE 1, isolated — the value lives behind the resolver's own `*_name`
 *     affix rung, which the deleted raw chain never looked at and which no
 *     amount of stringifying can reach.
 *  4. THE CONTROL — a non-empty `name` still renders its own name, unchanged.
 *
 * ## The clause-3 backstop is NOT pinned here, and that is a measurement
 *
 * Deleting the defensive stringify in `PageHeaderRenderer` leaves every pin
 * below GREEN. That is reported rather than fixed with a contrived pin: with
 * clauses 1 and 2 in place no rung of the title chain can produce a
 * non-string, because `pickLocalized` — which every author-supplied `title`
 * passes through — is typed to a string and collapses an object with no
 * string value to `''`. The backstop guards a future rung, not a reachable
 * one, so there is no honest fixture for it through the registered
 * component's public surface.
