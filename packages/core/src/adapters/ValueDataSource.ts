 *
 * ## Why this is refused rather than given a deep-equality reading
 *
 * The card was filed as "reference comparison excludes even the deep-equal
 * row", which is true, and the obvious repair is to make `['a','b']` equal
 * `['a','b']`. The census says otherwise, and the spec says who owns the
 * question. `assertListComparandShapes` (`@objectstack/spec/data`) lists
 * "arrays outside `$in`/`$nin`/`$between`" among the positions its comparand
 * door deliberately does NOT judge, on the stated ground that the ruling does
 * not name it and the matrix did not measure it — it is left "to the layers
 * that already answer it". Those layers do not agree, and the two nearest to
 * this one both REFUSE:
 *
 * - `@objectstack/formula`'s `matchesFilter` — the record-at-a-time evaluator
 *   this adapter is the closest sibling of — answers `false` structurally, on
 *   the comment "a bare array value is not a valid field spec (must be
 *   `{ $in: [...] }`)".
 * - `@objectstack/driver-sql` refuses an array comparand with its own message.
 * - Only the document stores give it array-equality, as a native behaviour of
 *   the store rather than a ruled contract.
 *
 * So there is no protocol answer to implement, and inventing one HERE is the
 * lenient-consumer fallback the repo forbids (AGENTS.md #0.1): a second
 * de-facto contract, agreed with by no backend, that a `provider: 'value'` list
 * would honour and the same filter on the wire would not. Every producer in
 * this repo already spells a multi-value comparand `{ $in: [...] }` — measured
 * across every `$filter` literal under the packages' and apps' source trees,
 * where the only array-valued comparands are `$in` / `$nin` members — so
 * refusing costs no caller a working filter, and the message names the
 * spelling that works. (The glob is spelled in words because a literal one
 * would close this comment.)
 *
 * ## The rows do not move; the silence does — except on the negations
 *
 * For `{ tags: [...] }` and `{ tags: { $eq: [...] } }` this changes no result
 * set: `!==` / `===` against a fresh array already excluded every row, so the
 * repair is the diagnostic. `$ne` / `!=` are the exception and the reason this
 * guard covers the operator positions too — `value !== target` against an
 * array is always TRUE, so an array comparand there selected EVERY row, in
 * silence. That is objectui#8447's fail-open direction surviving inside the
 * arm objectui#8514 was filed about, and the same repair closes both.

 * ## Not this file's ruling — the published table already refuses both
 *
 * `FILTER_TEXT_CASES` (`@objectstack/spec/data`) carries the two shapes as

 * > *a non-string `$icontains` comparand is REFUSED* — "Coercing 42 to `"42"`
 * > would answer a query nobody wrote; the declared comparand type is string."
 *
 * Measured on `origin/main` before this guard, over `FILTER_TEXT_ROWS`: the
 * empty comparand answered ALL NINE ROWS in both dialects with not one console
 * line — objectui#7349's fail-open signature, and the same widening class
 * objectui#8447 fixed one level up. The non-string comparand was quieter and
 * worse to debug: `String(42)` was evaluated and answered `[]`, which is
 * indistinguishable on screen from "evaluated, matched nothing" — which is why
 * pinning it as "42 and '42' agree" would pin nothing (they agree before this
 * guard too). What moves is the REFUSAL: the row is excluded and the operator
 * is named.
 *
 * ## Why only `icontains`, and why the row is excluded rather than thrown
 *
 * Only `$icontains` because only `$icontains` is what the table declares; the
 * sibling positive operators (`$contains` / `$startsWith` / `$endsWith`) have
 * no such row and are deliberately left alone rather than widened by analogy.
 * Excluded-and-logged because that is this face's declared refusal shape
 * (objectui#7349): the wire-side sibling `@object-ui/data-objectstack` throws
 * `MalformedFilterError` because it is deciding whether to send a query at all,
 * while this matcher is deciding about one row. Whether this face should carry
 * the throwing envelope instead is objectui#8600 Q1, and it stays closed.
 *
 * ⚠️ The PRODUCER half ships in the same change and is what makes this safe.
 * `FilterConditionField` emitted `{ [field]: { $icontains: value } }` verbatim,
 * so a builder row with the operator chosen and the value box still empty
 * produced exactly this shape — refusing it here alone would flip that list

 * ## Why this is implemented rather than refused
 *
 * `@objectstack/spec/data` declares the shape, `@objectstack/formula`'s
 * `compileCelToFilter` emits it for a field-to-field comparison in a CEL
 * permission rule, and BOTH platform evaluation paths execute it — the
 * in-memory `matchesFilter` resolves it in `resolveValue`, and `driver-sql`
 * compiles it to a same-table column-to-column comparison (objectstack#5222),
 * held to the same rows by a shared conformance corpus. Refusing it here would
 * make this adapter the one face that answers a declared, executed shape with
 * "no rows" — the outcome the sibling card ruled worse than the bug.
 *
 * Both of this file's matchers compared the reference OBJECT against the stored
 * value: `value === target` for `$eq` (never equal — no rows) and `value > target`
 * for the orderings (an object bound — no rows). Neither said anything.
 *
 * ## The three positions this refuses instead, each for a recorded reason
 *
 * - **A `$field` that is not a STRING.** `FieldReferenceSchema` declares
 *   `z.string()`, and the spec's own lowering predicate (matching `driver-sql`'s
 *   `fieldReferenceOf`) treats a non-string `$field` as "not a field reference
 *   on any path". Downstream that means "refused as the uncompilable object it
 *   is", which is what this does — loudly, rather than by object comparison.
 * - **A DOTTED path.** This matcher addresses the left-hand side as
 *   `record[field]`, flat, so resolving a dotted path only on the right would
 *   make `['a.b', '=', x]` and `['x', '=', { $field: 'a.b' }]` disagree about
 *   what a dot means. SQL push-down refuses a dotted path too, under the
 *   maintainer's 2026-08-06 same-table ruling (no JOIN planning, no alias
 *   contract). `@objectstack/formula` DOES walk dots — that divergence is named
 *   here rather than papered over, because this adapter has no path accessor to
 *   be consistent with.
 * - **`addDays`.** The whole-day offset (objectstack#14104) is defined against
 *   the referenced column's TEMPORAL CLASS — a `date` stays a calendar day, a
 *   `datetime` keeps its time of day — and SQL push-down compiles it only
 *   between two temporal columns of the same class, refusing everything else
 *   loudly. This matcher has no field types to read a class from, so it refuses
 *   for the same reason rather than guessing. Silently IGNORING the offset is
 *   the one answer that must not happen: it would compare against an unshifted
 *   column and return WRONG rows, where today's defect returns none.

/**
 * Evaluate ONE `$`-dialect operator against a record's value for a field.
 *
 * The vocabulary is the spec's own `FILTER_OPERATORS` (`@objectstack/spec/data`)
 * and each arm answers the same question its AST twin answers in
 * {@link matchesComparisonNode} — `$eq`/`=`, `$nin`/`nin`, `$startsWith`/
 * `starts_with`, and so on, one-to-one across ALL SIXTEEN: every declared
 * operator is executed here, none is refused by name. That pairing IS the
 * fix for objectui#8447: `find()` picks between the two matchers on nothing
 * more than whether `$filter` arrived as an array or an object, so any operator
 * one of them executes and the other waves through is a result that changes
 * with the SHAPE of the filter rather than with its meaning.
 *
 * ## What the `default` arm used to be
 *
 * `default: break` — which adds NO constraint. An operator this switch did not
 * name therefore matched EVERY row, silently, while the array arm of the very
 * same `if` refused the unknown node, excluded the row and logged it
 * (objectui#7349). Measured before the fix: `$nin`, `$startsWith`, `$null` and
 * `$exists` each returned the full set, and so did `$eq` — the most ordinary
 * operator an author can reach for, whose plain-equality sibling
 * (`{ age: 26 }`) was correct all along.
 *
 * The direction of the change is worth stating plainly, because it MOVES
 * RESULTS: a filter that silently selected everything now selects the rows it
 * names, and one this matcher cannot execute selects nothing and says so. Both
 * are louder than what they replace; neither is "match everything", which was
 * nobody's intent.
 *
 * ## What is refused, and why each one
 *
 * Nothing the spec DECLARES is on this list — `REFUSED_OPERATORS` in the
 * companion test is empty, so the `FILTER_OPERATORS` parity guard covers the
 * whole published vocabulary rather than a subset of it. What follows is
 * everything OUTSIDE that vocabulary.
 *
 * - **`$like` / `$ilike`** — declared by `StringOperatorSchema` but deliberately
 *   kept OUT of `FILTER_OPERATORS` while the faces that cannot execute them are
 *   staged in (objectstack#7536). This matcher has no pattern engine, and the
 *   spec's own note says naming them before an arm exists turns a loud refusal
 *   into a dropped predicate — i.e. every row, the defect this file just fixed.
 * - **`$regex` / `$options`** — RETIRED from the protocol (objectstack#4706).
 *   The refusal prints `RETIRED_FILTER_OPERATORS`' prescription verbatim, the
 *   way the five driver-side refusal sites do, so six faces say one thing.
 * - **Anything else**, including a nested relation constraint
 *   (`{ profile: { verified: true } }`), whose keys are field names rather than
 *   operators: this matcher does not descend into relations.

 * `$and` is `every` and `$or` is `some`, and the empty-array answers those two
 * reducers already give — `[].every(…)` is `true`, `[].some(…)` is `false` —
 * ARE the ruled identities. objectstack#5322 (closed `completed`, merged as
 * objectstack#5365) fixed `{ $and: [] }` as TRUE / every row and `{ $or: [] }`
 * as FALSE / no row, and `@objectstack/spec` pins all four identity answers in
 * the cross-backend `FILTER_LOGIC_CASES` table that
 * `ValueDataSource.filterLogicConformance.test.ts` drives this matcher through.
 * So there is no identity branch to write here and none to get wrong: writing
 * one would be a second statement of the rule that could drift from the table.
 *
 * A `{}` branch needs no arm either. {@link matchesFilter} answers `true` for a
 * filter with no entries, which is what makes a `{}` disjunct a TRUE branch
 * that ABSORBS its `$or` and a `{}` conjunct one that drops out of an `$and` —
 * the third and fourth identities, for free, from the same recursion.
 *
 * ## Why the members are checked BEFORE any of them is evaluated
 *
 * `every` / `some` short-circuit, so a lazy shape check would reach a malformed
 * member for some records and not for others — and `refusals` is drained once
 * per `find()`, so whether the author sees the diagnostic at all would depend
 * on which row happened to be tested first. Validating the whole member list up
 * front makes the refusal a property of the FILTER rather than of the data.
 *
 * A refused group excludes the row, the same direction every other refusal in
 * this file takes. Inside `$or` that is narrowing (one fewer way to match) and
 * inside `$and` it is exclusion outright; neither can widen a result set.

 *
 * **`$and` / `$or` are executed** because the semantics they were waiting on
 * have been ruled and shipped: objectstack#5322 (merged objectstack#5365)
 * settled the empty-group identities, and five platform backends already answer
 * to them through the shared `FILTER_LOGIC_CASES` conformance table. Refusing a

 * every wire face EXECUTES made this adapter the one face that answers "no
 * rows" to a filter the UI itself offers — the outcome objectui#8515 already
 * ruled worse than the bug. Executing them is therefore restoring a declared
 * invariant, not widening an accept set: no new operator, no new key, nothing
 * admitted that `FilterConditionSchema` does not already declare.
 *
 * **`$not` keeps its refusal**, deliberately and with its own message rather
 * than by falling through to the unknown-`$`-key arm below. objectstack#5146
 * (merged objectstack#5296) did rule its NULL-safe semantics — the operand
 * compiles to a TOTAL predicate before being negated — but this repo's own
 * `convertFiltersToAST` (`../utils/filter-converter.ts`) still THROWS for
 * `$not`, on a narrowing that is about the AST rather than about the ruling:
 * `FILTER_ARRAY_LOGIC_KEYWORDS` is `['and', 'or']`, so the array dialect has no
 * negation keyword, and rewriting the negation inward is silently partial
 * because `startswith` / `endswith` / `between` / `icontains` have no negated
 * counterpart in `VALID_AST_OPERATORS`. Whether that objectui-side narrowing
 * should stand now that upstream has ruled is a question objectui#8513 does not
 * decide, so `$not` is left exactly where it was — refused, loudly, and
 * distinguishable in the log from a group that executes.
