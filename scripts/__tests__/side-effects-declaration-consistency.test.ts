/**
 * objectui#3943: nothing in this repo ever checked that a package's
 * `sideEffects` declaration agrees with what its modules actually do when they
 * are evaluated.
 *
 * `sideEffects: false` is a PROMISE to bundlers: "no module in this package
 * does anything on evaluation, so drop any whose exports go unused". A bundler
 * that believes it does exactly that — silently. There is no error, no warning,
 * and exit code 0, because the bundler thinks it is executing your declaration
 * rather than discovering a defect.
 *
 * objectui#3899 is the specimen. `packages/layout` declared `"sideEffects":
 * false` while `src/index.ts` put six component keys into the `ComponentRegistry`
 * as a load-time side effect. Measured on main@230ffd875 by bundling the
 * documented side-effect-only import `import '@object-ui/layout';`:
 *
 *   sideEffects: false  ->  bundle is 0 bytes, zero registrations
 *   the honest array    ->  every `ComponentRegistry.register` call survives
 *
 * The failure surfaced far away, as a red `Unknown component type` panel
 * (OBJUI-001) on a green build. Nobody was bitten only because every consumer
 * that day ALSO imported a named export, which forces evaluation regardless —
 * coincidence, not design (objectui#3787 hit the hazard and routed around it by
 * calling `registerLayout()` explicitly).
 *
 * PR #3940 fixed layout and pinned it, but that pin was package-scoped: it read
 * `packages/layout/package.json` and probed layout's own entry forms. The next
 * package to repeat the mistake would turn nothing red. This file is that pin
 * generalised over the workspace — the same move objectui#3663 made for `files`
 * (`package-files-exist.test.ts`) after the drift was caught by hand twice in
 * one week.
 *
 * ## The two halves, and why both directions are checked
 *
 * A declaration is a claim about module bodies, so it can be wrong in two ways
 * and this gate rejects both:
 *
 *   - `sideEffects: false` + a load-time side effect  -> the objectui#3899 lie.
 *     The registration is dropped and the app breaks far from the cause.
 *   - `sideEffects: [...]` naming a module that has NO load-time side effect
 *     -> a phantom claim. It costs bundle size for every consumer and, worse,
 *     reads to the next author as "this module registers something", which is
 *     how a real entry gets deleted as noise.
 *
 * Same rule stated once: the manifest and the module bodies must agree, and
 * whichever half moves, the other moves with it. A red test here NEVER means
 * "put the side effect back" — it means the two halves disagree, and the fix is
 * whichever one is currently false.
 *
 * ## Why the population is derived from reachability, not from a file glob
 *
 * `sideEffects: false` licenses the bundler to drop ANY module of the package
 * whose exports go unused — not just the barrel. So the honest scan population
 * is the barrel plus every module transitively reachable from it by relative
 * import: exactly the set a bundler can drop, derived rather than listed.
 *
 * That also makes a test-file exclusion list unnecessary, which matters more
 * than it looks. A `src/**` glob would sweep in the colocated `*.test.ts` files
 * (28 top-level `describe(...)` calls in `packages/core/src` alone — measured),
 * every one of them a top-level call expression and none of them a bundling
 * hazard, because nothing imports them. Excluding them by NAME would then put a
 * hole in the gate shaped exactly like a filename. Reachability has no such
 * hole: a module the barrel cannot reach cannot be dropped from a barrel
 * import, and a module it can reach is scanned whatever it is called.
 *
 * ## What a real bundler is, and is not, used for here
 *
 * It is NOT used as the side-effect detector. That was measured before this
 * gate was written, by bundling each package's real source under a mirrored
 * `sideEffects: true` (which forces the module to be retained, so whatever
 * survives is what the bundler considers impure):
 *
 *   @object-ui/i18n         -> 1.28 MB retained  (`Object.freeze(Object.keys({...}))`
 *                              over the locale tables — module-local, harmless)
 *   @object-ui/types        -> 261 B retained    (`new Set(Object.values({...}))`)
 *   @object-ui/react-runtime-> 33 B retained     (bare imports of external deps)
 *   @object-ui/sdui-parser  -> 0 B
 *
 * Rollup's purity analysis is deliberately conservative, so "the bundler kept
 * something" does not mean "this package has an externally-visible side
 * effect". Reading those numbers as verdicts would have made this gate red on
 * three honest packages on day one. The static scan below asks the narrower,
 * decidable question instead: does a module body reach OUT — a bare call, a
 * write through a member expression, a side-effect-only import?
 *
 * The bundler IS used for the one question static analysis cannot answer: does
 * the declaration actually change what a bundler emits? Every probe below comes
 * with its `sideEffects: false` control, so a bundler that stopped honouring
 * the field would fail the control loudly instead of leaving every other
 * assertion green over nothing (PR #3940's anti-vacuity discipline, lifted).
 *
 * ## The workspace-alias trap
 *
 * The published paths are NOT the only consumption surface. In-repo bundler
 * configs alias `@object-ui/*` specifiers at a package's `src`, and a bundler
 * reads the SAME `package.json` for those source files. PR #3940 measured it:
 * with only the `dist/*` forms declared, the console's alias shape still
 * produced a 0-byte bundle. A gate that skipped alias entries would hand a
 * green light to a package that still breaks, so the alias tables are parsed
 * and folded into the entry forms below.
 *
 * The root `vitest.config.mts` has such a table and is deliberately NOT read:
 * Vitest transforms and executes modules, it does not tree-shake them, so
 * `sideEffects` has no effect on that path. It is not a bundling surface. The
 * same reasoning scopes the parse below to `resolve.alias` and not to a
 * `test.alias` inside a `vite.config.*`.
 *
 * ## What this gate deliberately does NOT prove
 *
 * That a top-level `const x = f()` is pure. A call in a variable INITIALIZER is
 * not flagged: module-local consts are the overwhelming majority (225 of them
 * in `packages/types` alone), a bundler drops the unused ones, and flagging
 * them would bury the real signal. So `const _ = registerLayout();` would slip
 * past — a contrived spelling with no instance in the tree today (verified
 * across all 157 reachable modules of the five `sideEffects: false` packages),
 * and named here rather than papered over.

 * Alias tables parsed out of every bundler config in the workspace.

 * whole Vite plugin surface at module scope, and a guard that only needs a list
 * of strings should not boot that.
 *
 * ## Why a parser and not a regex (objectui#5158)
 *
 * Until #5158 this read the source TEXT with one regex that required the exact
 * characters `path.resolve(` after a SINGLE-quoted key inside an object
 * literal. Every config that spelled the same table any other way was not
 * checked-and-passed, it was never looked at — measured on `main@cdac3cc20`:
 * 70 of 196 entries read, 15 configs contributing zero. Three independent
 * spellings were invisible, and only the first is the one #5158 opened on:
 *
 *   - `import { resolve } from 'path'` + `resolve(__dirname, …)` — 15 configs,
 *     105 entries (every `packages/plugin-*` that has a table);
 *   - the ARRAY table form, `alias: [{ find, replacement }]` — 7 entries in
 *     `packages/components`, which a widened `(?:path\.)?resolve` regex would
 *     still have missed because there is no `'key':` at all;
 *   - DOUBLE-quoted keys — 14 entries in `packages/runner`, missed for a reason
 *     that has nothing to do with `resolve` and everything to do with `'`.
 *
 * Three invisible spellings of one structure is the argument against
 * enumerating spellings — the widened `(?:path\.)?` regex #5158 proposed closes
 * the first and leaves the other two, because they do not differ on `resolve`.
 * The AST reads the structure instead: a property of an alias table whose
 * value is a `resolve(dirname, '<relative>')` call, however the callee, the
 * quotes and the table are written.
 *
 * It also retires two decoys by construction rather than by heuristic. A
 * `rollupOptions.output.globals` map is keyed by the same specifiers
 * (`'@object-ui/core': 'ObjectUICore'`) and is not an alias table — outside
 * `resolve.alias`, so it is never reached, and its values are strings, so it
 * could not parse anyway. And a specifier quoted inside a COMMENT is not a
 * node: the previous reader stripped whole comment LINES to approximate that,
 * which left an entry inside a multi-line block comment counted as live, and
 * `examples/console-starter/vite.config.ts` still carries a note that it avoids
 * spelling a quoted specifier in prose because "that decoy already fooled one
 * scan". The parser makes the note unnecessary rather than load-bearing.
 *
 * ## What is still out of reach, named
 *
 * `apps/console` mutates its table at runtime under an env var
 * (`Object.assign(workspaceAliases, specDistInjection.aliases)`, gated on
 * `OBJECTSTACK_SPEC_DIST`). A static read sees the baseline literal, which is
 * the table every ordinary build uses, and the injected entries alias
 * `@objectstack/spec` — not an `@object-ui/*` package, so they could not
 * contribute an entry form here in any case.
