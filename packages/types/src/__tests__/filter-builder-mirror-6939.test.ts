 * objectui#6939, the `filter-builder` group — the VALIDATOR half. The render
 * half is
 * `examples/schema-catalog/test/filter-builder-mirror-6939.test.tsx`.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * Three independent mis-declarations in one member, each a key-name or
 * vocabulary MOVE rather than a missing optional key:
 *
 *   1. `FilterFieldSchema` required `name`. Every read site matches an entry by
 *      `value` — `fields.find((f) => f.value === …)` in `getOperatorsForField`,
 *      `changeField`, `getInputType` and `renderValueInput`, `fields[0]?.value`
 *      in `addCondition`, and `<SelectItem value={field.value}>` in the field
 *      dropdown. `name` had zero.
 *   2. Its `type` enum was `string | number | date | boolean | select`.
 *      `string` is a phantom; `text`, `datetime` and `time` — three of the six
 *      `FilterValueFamily` members the component actually folds a column into —
 *      were all refused.
 *   3. `FilterGroupSchema` was `{ operator, conditions }`. The gate is
 *      `isValidGroup` (`custom/filter-builder.tsx:1060`), which reads
 *      `conditions` and `logic` and nothing else.
 *
 * All five `components-complex-filter-builder/*` catalog entries author
 * `{ value, label, type }` fields and a `{ id, logic, conditions }` group — the
 * registration's own `inputs`/`defaultProps` spelling — so the mirror refused
 * every one of them while the renderer drew them.
 *
 * ## Ruling
 *
 * Maintainer, 2026-09-02, via the director seat (summon #8), verbatim 「同意」,
 * recorded as objectui#6939 comment 5510084784. Its `filter-builder` row:
 * *field key is `value`; type vocabulary `text` / `number` / `boolean` /
 * `date` / `datetime` / `time`; group shape `{ id, logic, conditions }`.*
 *
 * ## Two places this implementation departs from a LITERAL reading, and why
 *
 * Both are measured, both are declared here rather than made quietly, and both
 * are flagged on the PR for contract review.
 *
 *   - **`select` is retained.** The ruling's six-member list inherits the
 *     finding card's description of `select` as "extra". It is not: it has its
 *     own operator bucket (`selectLikeTypes`, `custom/filter-builder.tsx:935`,
 *     read by `operatorsForFieldType` and `isOptionDrivenValueControl`) and
 *     draws the option-driven Select instead of a text box. Dropping it would
 *     refuse a spelling this mirror accepts TODAY and the renderer draws
 *     distinctly — a fresh instance of the class this card closes.
 *   - **Group `id` is declared OPTIONAL.** `isValidGroup` never consults it and
 *     nothing reads `filterGroup.id`; deleting it from an authored group
 *     renders byte-identically (the render half measures that). Requiring it
 *     would invent a refusal the renderer does not make.
 *
 * ## objectui#7562 — the vocabulary widened to the published doc's FOURTEEN
 *
 * Ruled 2026-09-08 (director seat, decision batch #88): of the three
 * declarations of this authoring surface the published doc is the AUTHORITY,
 * so `type` widens to its fourteen members and becomes OPTIONAL (`text` when
 * absent). The ruling's precondition — every one of the fourteen has a
 * renderer branch, or it comes out of the doc instead — was measured first,
 * one condition row per member through the real `FilterBuilder`, reading both
 * the value control and the operator bucket. All fourteen passed; nothing was
 * withdrawn from the doc. `FilterFieldSchema`'s docblock carries the table.
 *
 * The assertions below therefore MOVED, not merely widened: the seven
 * `still refuses the live-but-unruled spelling …` pins became
 * `accepts …, and the renderer draws it`, and the doc-vs-mirror assertion's
 * closing line — which pinned that the mirror still required `type` — became
 * its opposite. That is the whole delta objectui#7562 lands here.
 *
 * ## objectui#8774 — the doc-WIDENING direction, which nothing here caught
 *
 * objectui#7562 made the doc the authority, but the pins in this file bound the
 * enum to a hard-coded `DOCUMENTED_FOURTEEN` constant, and the doc-reading pin
 * asserted only doc ⊇ fourteen. So of the two ways the authority can move, one
 * was guarded and one was not:
 *
 *   - doc NARROWS (a member removed) → the ⊇ pin reddens.
 *   - doc WIDENS (a fifteenth member added) → nothing reddened. And widening is
 *     the direction objectui#7562 CAME FROM: the doc published fourteen while
 *     the mirror accepted seven, and no instrument said so.
 *
 * Measured, not reasoned. The ceiling reviewer's ablation Leg E added `'email'`
 * to the DOC alone (hash-verified, restored) and every pin in this file stayed
 * green; its control, Leg D — the same member added to BOTH code faces — did
 * redden, so the file was live and the hole was directional.
 *
 * The fix is that the population is now TAKEN from the doc (`documentedTypes()`)
 * instead of copied beside it, so `the accept set is EXACTLY the published doc`
 * compares the enum against the authority rather than against a copy of it and
 * fails in both directions. A doc-seeded pin has its own failure mode — a reader
 * that silently matches nothing turns the pin vacuous in the same stroke — so
 * every reader THROWS on absence and `the doc reader has a floor` drives that,
 * with the doc's own two-member `logic` union as the positive control.
 *
 * ⛔ If this pin reddens because the DOC widened: the mirror follows, as its own
 * reviewable change. ⛔ Never narrow the doc to match the mirror — under
 * decision batch #88 a contract does not retract what it published to authors.
 *
 * ## What this change does NOT reach, stated rather than left as an absence
 *
 * Two of the four census entries — `product-search` and `with-conditions`, plus
 * the `filter-builder` nested inside `search-interface` — still refuse
 * afterwards, on a FOURTH divergence the ruling does not address: they author
 * `conditions[].operator` as `eq` / `gt` / `lt`, and `FilterOperatorSchema` is
 * the spec's canonical `equals` / `greater_than` / `less_than`.
 * `assertion the residual refusal is the operator alias and nothing else`
 * pins that mechanically — swapping only those three spellings makes both
 * entries parse — so the claim "the three ruled divergences are gone from all
 * four" is measured rather than asserted. The operator vocabulary is a genuine
 * fork (the builder's own dropdown ids are `notEquals` / `greaterThan`, which
 * this mirror ALSO refuses, while the canonical spellings it accepts render a
 * blank operator trigger) and needs its own ruling.

    //     zero-members throw fires out of `documentedTypes()`, and six tests in
    //     this file redden, this one among them at leg (2) rather than here.
    //     So the guard exists; it is the THROW below plus the equality pin, not
    //     this control. ⚠️ A control that names a mode it cannot catch is the
