/**
 * The tier's half of objectui#6771 — the retired `body` child-list dialect.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at all
 *
 * The retirement's acceptance evidence was measured on the BUILT CLI, and that
 * reading is about the ZOD tier: `objectui validate` parses through
 * `@object-ui/types`' mirrors, where `body` is an `aliasKeyRefusal`. ⛔ It says
 * NOTHING about `validateTree`, which is a different tier with a different
 * vocabulary — it parses a manifest, never a zod schema, and it is the tier the
 * card was FILED about: the original defect was that `validateTree` answered
 * `unknown-prop` on `body`, the one spelling a dozen registrations resolved.
 *
 * ⇒ a change that moves what this tier says about `body` needs its own pin, or
 * the card's own subject is the one surface with no coverage.
 *
 * ## The two verdicts, and why they are two
 *
 * The ruling's step 4 has two clauses: the tier teaches `children` only, and a
 * `body` child list under a non-container draws the same `not-a-container` the
 * `children` spelling draws. `./body-dialect.ts` answers both by REPLACING the
 * prop walk's diagnostic rather than adding to it — two diagnostics for one
 * mistake is the shape `checkMemberTypes` already refuses (objectui#8067), and
 * the shape `checkKanbanQuickAdd` next door is written against.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ What each row must not be allowed to pass on
 *
 * Every assertion below names a CODE and asserts the message names `children`.
 * The code alone is not enough: the pre-retirement tier already answered
 * `unknown-prop` for `body`, so a row asserting only that code is green in BOTH
 * worlds and measures nothing. What moved is that the answer now carries the
 * remedy, which is the whole reason the replacement exists rather than a bare
 * refusal. And the `children` control beside each row is what keeps "the tier
 * refuses `body`" a reading rather than "this tier refuses everything".
