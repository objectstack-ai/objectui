 *
 * A non-Date EXOTIC object in comparand position — objectui#8567.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * The operator-object arm opens on `typeof value === 'object' &&
 * !Array.isArray(value)` and then iterates `Object.entries(value)`. Every
 * entry-less object therefore ran the loop body zero times and pushed NO
 * condition for its field. objectui#8555 closed exactly one door of that hole —
 * `Date`, which the spec rules IN as a literal comparand. Every other entry-less
 * object was still dropped:
 *
 *     { status: 'a', created: /abc/ }        ->  ['status', '=', 'a']
 *     { status: 'a', tags: new Set(['x']) }  ->  ['status', '=', 'a']
 *     { status: 'a', m: new Map() }          ->  ['status', '=', 'a']
 *
 * Nothing threw, nothing warned, and the result set got WIDER than the author
 * asked for — the one failure direction this file exists to avoid. As with the
 * Date half, the field's fate depended on its SIBLINGS: with the exotic value
 * alone, `conditions` ended empty and the ORIGINAL OBJECT came back untouched,
 * so the defect was invisible until a second field appeared. Section 2 pins that
 * asymmetry closed.
 *
 * ## The ruling — REFUSE, and the spec is what decides that
 *
 * The opposite answer to objectui#8555 on the same arm, for the opposite reason:
 * there the spec rules the shape IN, here it rules it OUT. Measured against
 * `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0 (declared floor `^17.2.0`), and pinned in section 3:
 * `isAcceptedFilterComparand(/x/)` is `false`, and
 * `normalizeFilterComparandTypes({ created: /x/ })` refuses with
 * `INVALID_FILTER` / 400 — *"Filter comparand at where.created is a RegExp
 * instance ({}), which no driver can compare."* Lowering it would only move that
 * refusal downstream; dropping it is the defect itself. So the refusal lands
 * HERE, where the field name and the offending value are both still in hand.
 *
 * ## Which refusal CLASS this is — read, not inherited
 *
 * `filter-converter.ts` carries seven `FilterOperatorError` throws, and they are
 * not one class (each was read, not counted):
 *
 *   - `$regex` and the unknown-operator arm — operator VOCABULARY: the spelling
 *     is absent from the spec's `FILTER_OPERATORS`, so there is nothing to
 *     translate it into;
 *   - `$not` — AST EXPRESSIVENESS: the spec DECLARES it, but the array dialect
 *     this file emits has no negation keyword;
 *   - the two `lowerLogicalGroup` throws — combinator ARGUMENT shape, against
 *     the spec's declared `'$and?: FilterCondition[]'`;
 *   - the bare-array arm and the stored-rule arity arm — comparand SHAPE, argued
 *     from downstream behaviour precisely because the spec DECLINES to rule
 *     (`assertListComparandShapes` rules only on `$in` / `$nin` / `$between`).
 *
 * This one is none of those: it is a comparand TYPE the spec itself rejects. So
 * the `$regex` / `$not` message idiom ("this layer has no target for your
 * operator") is deliberately NOT copied — it would answer a question nobody
 * asked. What IS shared is the error TYPE, and on a measurement rather than on
 * the name: four of the seven existing throws are already non-operator refusals,
 * because what `FilterOperatorError` actually transports is the `INVALID_FILTER`
 * / 400 envelope `classifyLoadError` reads. Section 4 pins both halves.
 *
 * ## The one shape that must NOT be swept up
 *
 * An empty operator object `{}` is the TRUE identity, constrains nothing, and is
 * deliberate (objectui#5322, pinned in `filter-date-comparand-8555.test.ts`
 * section 4). It has no own entries either — which is exactly why the gate is
 * the PROTOTYPE and not `Object.keys(value).length === 0`: that count cannot
 * tell `{}` from `/x/`, and the two need opposite answers. Section 5 is the
 * control, and it must stay green in every ablation leg.
 *
 * ## What carries the weight — two legs, RUN against the committed tree
 *
 * Each was applied to the COMMITTED implementation, proved on disk before it was
 * run (`git hash-object` moved off the `HEAD` blob, and the anchored marker count
 * went 1 -> 0 for the removal and 0 -> 1 for the injection), and restored BY
 * STATE afterwards (`git diff HEAD` empty and the blob back at `5ba58fb`). No
 * rebuild is involved and none is needed: `vitest.config.mts` aliases
 * `@object-ui/core` to `packages/core/src`, so these files execute the SOURCE and
 * there is no `dist/` hop a stale build could make silently green.
 *
 * 1. **Ablation** — the refusal branch removed (16 lines). 10 of 34 red, across
 *    BOTH files. MODE: the refusal is MISSING and it fails as the defect itself —
 *    `convertFiltersToAST({ created: /abc/ })` hands back `{ created: /abc/ }`,
 *    the original object, because `conditions` ended empty. Every control stayed
 *    GREEN, both `{}` identity pins included.
 * 2. **`Object.keys(value).length === 0` as the gate** — the caricature this arm
 *    has to be distinguishable from, and the one a reader reaches for first. 4 of
 *    34 red. MODE: over-refusal — `{}` is swept up and the TRUE identity becomes
 *    a throw, so BOTH `{}` controls redden (this file's and
 *    filter-date-comparand-8555.test.ts's), together with the `Money`
 *    counter-case and the message pin. That is the leg that proves the control is
 *    a control: it moves when the change is WRONG, and does not move when the
 *    subject is merely absent.
