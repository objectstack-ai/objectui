# @object-ui/mobile

## 17.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 2d7304d: Retire the `MobileOverrides` type and its `mobileOverrides` mount point (objectui#4919,
  maintainer ruling 2026-08-19, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).
  
  `MobileOverrides` published a six-key mobile override surface — `layout`, `columns`,
  `useBottomSheet`, `fullScreen`, `touchTarget` and a three-value `navigation` vocabulary
  (`'bottom-tabs' | 'hamburger' | 'drawer'`) — from `@object-ui/types` and, re-exported,
  from `@object-ui/mobile`. Nothing read any of it. Measured on current `main`: the type had
  exactly four mentions repo-wide — its own declaration, the single
  `MobileComponentConfig.mobileOverrides` mount point, and the two barrel re-exports — and
  the lower-case property name (the spelling a renderer would actually read) appeared only
  in that declaration. No renderer, hook or adapter resolved it, and a sweep of the example
  apps and the `objectstack` sibling checkout found zero authors. The three `navigation`
  values were three spellings of the same no-op.
  
  The declared surface is removed rather than narrowed. The #3985 lineage's rule is "narrow
  to the implemented values"; here the implemented set is empty, so that rule terminates in
  deletion — a config that type-checks, builds and silently does nothing is the
  declare-without-enforce shape the platform doctrine forbids.
  
  Removal rather than a `?: never` tombstone follows this package's own discriminator. A
  tombstone exists to steer authors to a named live replacement — `crud.ts` `confirm` →
  `confirmText` (objectui#4314), `data-display.ts` `hoverable` / `striped` → `data-table`
  (objectui#5474) — or to keep a key loud that the docs had actively taught as working.
  Neither applies: there is no replacement key to steer to, no documentation ever described
  the surface, and there is no successor spelling. That is the same zero-pull, no-successor
  shape as the retired `AccordionItem.icon` (objectui#4652) and `ToggleGroupItem.icon`
  (objectui#4632), both of which were removed outright rather than tombstoned.
  
  **Breaking for TypeScript authors of `MobileOverrides` / `mobileOverrides` only** (marked
  `minor` per this repo's version-alignment rule, which reserves `major` for following
  `@objectstack` across a major — see AGENTS.md's 版本号策略, and the identical
  classification used for `AccordionItem.icon`). Runtime behaviour is unchanged: an authored
  `mobileOverrides` did nothing before and does nothing now. What changes is that the
  contract no longer claims otherwise, so the mistake surfaces at authoring time — importing
  the type is now a "has no exported member" error, and authoring the key on a
  `MobileComponentConfig` object literal is an excess-property error, instead of a silent
  no-op that type-checks and builds.
  
  If real mobile-override renderer work is ever wanted it re-enters deliberately, as designed
  product surface on its own card, with the renderer landing in the same change as the
  declaration — not by resurrecting this declaration.
- 90665e0: **Removes a published export.** Retire the `MobileComponentConfig` type
  (objectui#5942, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove). The name is deleted from
  `@object-ui/types` and from `@object-ui/mobile`, which re-exported it — after
  this release `import type { MobileComponentConfig }` from either package is a
  compile error, not a deprecation warning.
  
  `MobileComponentConfig` published a four-key "mobile component schema
  extension" — `responsive`, `gestures`, `pullToRefresh` and `infiniteScroll` —
  and nothing read it. Re-measured on current `main` before anything was deleted:
  the type had exactly four code mentions repo-wide — its own declaration, one
  doc-comment cross-reference, and the two barrel re-exports. It had **no mount
  point at all**: no type mounted it as a property, nothing extended it, and no
  renderer, hook or adapter annotated, cast to or imported it. A sweep of the
  example apps and the `objectstack` sibling checkout found zero authors. Every
  read-shape probe returned zero against a control lit in the same run.
  
  That makes it stricter than the usual case: not merely a surface whose values
  were unimplemented, but a container with no path by which any authored value
  could reach a renderer. objectui#4919 removed its last member
  (`mobileOverrides`), which is what left the container itself inert.
  
  Removed outright rather than kept as a `?: never` tombstone, on this package's
  own discriminator: a tombstone steers authors to a named live replacement key
  (`crud.ts` `confirm` to `confirmText`; `data-display.ts` `hoverable`/`striped`
  to `data-table`), or keeps loud a key the docs taught as working. Neither
  applies — the whole interface goes, so there is no surviving object to hang a
  `never` key on, and no documentation ever described it
  (`skills/objectui/guides/mobile.md` teaches the hooks, never this type). Same
  zero-pull, no-successor shape as `MobileOverrides` (objectui#4919) and
  `AccordionItem.icon` / `ToggleGroupItem.icon`.
  
  ## Upgrading
  
  **No behaviour changes and there is nothing to migrate at runtime.** An object
  authored against this type did nothing before and does nothing now; what
  changes is that the contract no longer claims otherwise, so the mistake
  surfaces at authoring time instead of silently type-checking.
  
  - **You imported the type only** (the only thing that was possible — nothing
    accepted it as a value): delete the import. If you kept a local config object
    annotated with it, drop the annotation; the object was never passed anywhere
    that read it.
  - **You actually wanted the behaviour:** it exists, and it is not being
    retired. It lives in `@object-ui/mobile` as React hooks, which is where the
    working code always was — `useResponsive` / `ResponsiveContainer` for
    `responsive`, `useGesture` for `gestures`, `usePullToRefresh` for
    `pullToRefresh`. `infiniteScroll` has no hook; it was never implemented in
    any form. See `skills/objectui/guides/mobile.md`.
  - **You want a declarative mobile config surface:** that re-enters deliberately
    as designed product surface on its own card, with the renderer that reads it
    landing in the same change as the declaration — not by restoring this
    declaration.
  
  **Do not follow the compiler's suggestion.** TypeScript reports the removal from
  `@object-ui/types` as TS2724 and appends `Did you mean 'ComponentConfig'?`. That
  is a lexical near-match, not a migration target: `ComponentConfig` is the
  renderer **registration** record (`{ type: string; component: T }`, extending
  `ComponentMeta`) and has nothing to do with mobile configuration. The import
  from `@object-ui/mobile` gets a plain TS2305 with no suggestion at all.
  
  Marked `minor`, not `major`, per this repo's version-alignment rule, which
  reserves `major` for following `@objectstack` across a major (AGENTS.md
  版本号策略) — the same classification objectui#4919's identically breaking type
  removal used. **Breaking for TypeScript consumers of the name only.**
  
  Follow-up, deliberately not widened into this change: `MobileResponsiveConfig`
  and `GestureConfig` were consumed only by this container and are now
  zero-consumer published types themselves. Filed as objectui#7519 for triage.
- 51eb515: **Removes two published exports.** Retire the `MobileResponsiveConfig` and
  `GestureConfig` types (objectui#7519, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove). Both names
  are deleted from `@object-ui/types` and from `@object-ui/mobile`, which
  re-exported them — after this release `import type { MobileResponsiveConfig }`
  or `import type { GestureConfig }` from either package is a compile error, not a
  deprecation warning.
  
  Each had exactly one consumer: the `responsive` and `gestures` members of
  `MobileComponentConfig`, which objectui#5942 retired. Re-measured on current
  `main` before anything was deleted, each was a declaration plus the two barrel
  re-exports and nothing else — no type mounted either, nothing extended,
  annotated, cast to or imported them outside the barrels, and the example apps
  and the `objectstack` sibling checkout had zero authors. A value written against
  either could not reach a renderer or a handler by any path. That is the same
  declared-surface-with-no-consumption-path shape as `MobileComponentConfig`
  itself and `MobileOverrides` (objectui#4919) before it, one level down.
  
  Removed outright rather than kept as `?: never` tombstones, measured against
  this package's two-prong discriminator (a tombstone steers authors to a named
  live replacement key, or keeps loud a key the docs taught as working). Prong 1:
  neither has a replacement key — the behaviour they named lives in hooks, and
  `SpecGestureConfig` is a different contract, not a successor. Prong 2: the only
  release-note lines naming either are the objectstack#4115 rename-ledger rows
  and, for `GestureConfig`, the objectui#3363 reclaim note; none taught a
  renderer or dispatcher reading them, and no member carried a published
  `@default` (contrast `triggerIcon`, tombstoned by objectui#7654 on exactly that
  evidence). Structurally there is also no silent-strip hazard for a tombstone to
  guard: whole interfaces go, nothing ever parsed them, and the mobile module has
  never had a `zod/` twin to host a `retirementTombstone()`. The compiler was the
  only channel these names ever had, and the refusal now lives there.
  
  ## Upgrading
  
  **No behaviour changes and there is nothing to migrate at runtime.** An object
  authored against either type did nothing before and does nothing now; what
  changes is that the contract no longer claims otherwise, so the mistake surfaces
  at authoring time instead of silently type-checking.
  
  - **You imported a type only** (the only thing that was possible — nothing
    accepted either as a value): delete the import. If you kept a local object
    annotated with it, drop the annotation; it was never passed anywhere that read
    it.
  - **You wanted per-breakpoint layout:** it exists and is not being retired —
    `useResponsive` / `ResponsiveContainer` / `useBreakpoint` in
    `@object-ui/mobile`. `ResponsiveValue` and `BreakpointName` stay exported from
    both packages.
  - **You wanted to bind a gesture to a handler:** `useGesture` in
    `@object-ui/mobile` takes `{ type: GestureType, onGesture, threshold?,
    longPressDuration?, enabled? }`. `GestureType` and `GestureContext` stay
    exported from both packages.
  - **You want a declarative mobile config surface:** that re-enters deliberately
    as designed product surface on its own card, with the renderer that reads it
    landing in the same change as the declaration — not by restoring these
    declarations.
  
  **Do not follow the compiler's suggestion for `GestureConfig`.** Measured against
  the built declarations: `import type { GestureConfig }` from either package now
  fails as TS2724 with `Did you mean 'SpecGestureConfig'?`. That is a lexical
  near-match, not a migration target. `SpecGestureConfig` is the retired
  `@objectstack/spec` `ui/touch` **tuning** record (`{ type, label, enabled,
  swipe, pinch, longPress }`) that `useSpecGesture` reads; it has no `action`
  member and does not bind a gesture to anything. `MobileResponsiveConfig` fails
  as a plain TS2305 with no suggestion from either package.
  
  Marked `minor`, not `major`, per this repo's version-alignment rule (AGENTS.md
  版本号策略), which reserves `major` for following `@objectstack` across a major —
  the same classification objectui#5942 and objectui#4919 used for identically
  breaking type removals. **Breaking for TypeScript consumers of the two names
  only.** The in-repo consumer count is zero; consumers outside this repository
  that import either name from either package are not visible from here, which is
  why this entry is graded on the published-surface change and not on that count.
- e62c44e: Re-home the breakpoint layout vocabulary and delete the two dead responsive
  implementations (objectui#7580, maintainer ruling 2026-09-04, option A).
  
  **Breaking, deliberately, in one direction only.** `@objectstack/spec` retired its whole
  `ui/responsive` vocabulary in objectstack#11027 — `ResponsiveConfigSchema`,
  `BreakpointName`, `BreakpointColumnMapSchema` and `BreakpointOrderMapSchema` — on the
  stated ground that the four types "had no other authorable carrier". That ground is
  measurably false on the renderer side: `responsive-grid` is a REGISTERED SDUI component
  whose authorable `columns` input is typed by `BreakpointColumnMap` and applied by
  `resolveColumnClasses` on the render path, and `BreakpointName` types four live readers in
  `@object-ui/mobile`. The tombstone's own return condition — the vocabulary "returns if and
  when a renderer implements it" — is already met here, so the two types a renderer reads
  are re-homed rather than retired.
  
  What survives, under the same names and the same members:
  
  - `BreakpointName` (`xs`…`2xl`) is now declared in `@object-ui/types` (`mobile.ts`) instead
    of re-exported from the spec. **No consumer change**: same name, same six members, same
    export sites on `@object-ui/types` and `@object-ui/mobile`. Only its provenance moved.
  - `BreakpointColumnMap` is now declared in `@object-ui/layout` (`ResponsiveGrid.tsx`),
    verbatim from the retired `$strict` schema: six optional column counts, no index
    signature. `responsive-grid`'s `columns` input and its resolver are unchanged.
  
  What is removed:
  
  - `BreakpointOrderMap` (`@object-ui/layout`) — retired with the key, not re-homed. It had
    no read point in the package; it was published only because the retired
    `ResponsiveConfigSchema` paired it with the column map, so an author configuring `order`
    needed the type. With the schema gone there is no order vocabulary for it to be the type
    of, and re-declaring it would be the declare-without-enforce shape ADR-0049 removes.
  - `useResponsiveConfig` (`@object-ui/mobile`), with its `SpecResponsiveConfig` and
    `ResolvedResponsiveState` exports, and `ResponsiveProtocol` (`@object-ui/core`), with
    `resolveResponsiveConfig` / `getVisibilityClasses` / `getColumnClasses` /
    `getOrderClasses` / `shouldHideAtBreakpoint`. Both read the retired
    `ResponsiveConfigSchema` and both were measured at zero callers (objectui#4773).
  - `SpecResponsiveConfig` / `SpecBreakpointName` (`@object-ui/types`) — dead re-exports once
    the two implementations above went, dropped rather than re-declared locally, the same
    disposition the retired i18n names in that file already carry.
  
  No behaviour is retired. The live per-breakpoint readers — `useBreakpoint`,
  `ResponsiveContainer`, `BREAKPOINTS` / `BREAKPOINT_ORDER` / `getCurrentBreakpoint`, and
  `responsive-grid` itself — are untouched.
  
  **Sequencing.** objectui's next `@objectstack/spec` pin bump must carry `Blocked-by:`
  objectui#7580: the retirement is merged upstream and unreleased, so this must land first.

### Patch Changes

- 5458414: Publish relative import specifiers with explicit `.js` extensions so these six packages load under plain Node ESM.
  
  Node's ESM resolver does not extension-search relative specifiers and `tsc` never rewrites them, so an extensionless `./Foo` in the source shipped as an extensionless `./Foo` in `dist` and importing the package entry outside a bundler failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Bundled consumers were unaffected. Unbundled consumers — plain Node ESM, an SSR host importing the package directly, anyone running the published tarball without a build step — can now import these entries, and so can the downstream `@object-ui/plugin-*` packages that evaluate through `mobile`, `permissions` and `providers`.

## 17.5.0

### Patch Changes

- c911544: `SpecResponsiveConfig` is now the spec's responsive config rather than a hand copy that said it was

  `useResponsiveConfig.ts` declared its own interface over the four responsive keys — `breakpoint`, `hiddenOn`, `columns`, `order` — renamed off the schema's own symbol (`ResponsiveConfig` → `SpecResponsiveConfig`) and introduced by a comment that said it mirrored `ResponsiveConfigSchema`. There was no import, no `z.infer`, and no other compile-time tie: the sentence was the entire connection.

  It agreed with the schema key-for-key on the day it was measured, and that is the reason this is worth a line rather than the reason it is not. The agreement was maintained by nobody and checked by nothing, while the comment told every later reader the copy was canonical — so a key added or retired upstream would have moved the two apart in silence, with the comment still vouching for the copy. `ViewNavigationConfig` read exactly like this until it had drifted on `mode`.

  The type is now re-exported from `@object-ui/types`, which publishes it imported straight from `@objectstack/spec/ui`. That package is already this one's only runtime dependency, so the binding costs no new dependency edge, and `@object-ui/core`'s `ResponsiveProtocol` already reaches the same type the same way.

  Nothing consumers see changes: the published name is the same, and the type it resolves to is invariant-equal to the interface that was there before — the entry `.d.ts` is byte-identical. What changes is where the four keys come from. They are now whatever the schema declares, so the next schema release reaches this package's authors as a type error instead of as silent disagreement.

  A new parity test pins the chain to `@objectstack/spec/ui` directly, because the one link the re-export cannot see is `@object-ui/types` re-growing a hand copy of its own.

## 17.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 48132f7: Track the `@objectstack` family at `17.0.0-rc.5` (objectui#3560).

  The pin moves from `^17.0.0-rc.2` to `^17.0.0-rc.5` across all 37 declarations in
  30 `package.json` files, and the sibling `@objectstack/*` packages (`client` /
  `formula` / `lint`) move with it — they pin `@objectstack/spec` **exactly**, so
  leaving them behind would keep a second copy of the spec in the tree and have
  `@objectstack/lint` validating against schemas that still accept the keys rc.3–rc.5
  retire. `pnpm-lock.yaml` now resolves one copy of each of the six family packages
  (`spec` / `client` / `core` / `formula` / `lint` / `sdui-parser`), all at rc.5.

  Bumping the pin and repairing the fallout cannot be split: the pin alone reddens
  CI, and the code alone targets a shape that is not in effect yet.

  ## A live bug this upgrade fixes

  **`ObjectStackDataSource.delete()` never emitted its mutation event, and resolved
  `undefined` instead of a boolean.** `@objectstack/client`'s `DeleteDataResult`
  declared a key called `deleted` — a key no schema has ever declared and no server
  path has ever returned on `DELETE /data/:object/:id`. So `result.deleted`
  compiled and read `undefined` at runtime: the guard never fired, a successful
  delete notified no subscriber, and every consumer's cache stayed stale.
  objectstack#5638 corrected the interface to the schema's `success`; following the
  rename is what restores both behaviours. Nothing in this repo had to change shape
  for it — the code was already asking the right question of the wrong key.

  ## Breaking, in FROM → TO form

  - **The five `@objectstack/spec/ui` interaction-config modules are gone** —
    touch / dnd / keyboard / animation / offline, 32 defs and 64 exports
    (objectstack#4988, PR objectstack#5321). None of them had an authoring door: no
    metadata document could ever carry one of these blocks, so a stack that parsed
    before the retirement parses byte-for-byte the same after it. `@object-ui/types`
    drops the 32 `export type` re-exports. The vocabulary each one's only real
    consumer needs is now declared by that consumer, which is the remedy the spec's
    own retirement ledger prescribes ("declare that union locally — it is your
    client's policy, not the platform's"):

    - `@object-ui/react`'s `useOffline` owns `OfflineStrategy`, `ConflictResolution`,
      `PersistStorageType`, `EvictionPolicyType`, `OfflineConfig`,
      `OfflineCacheConfig`, `OfflineSyncConfig`;
    - `@object-ui/core`'s `DndProtocol` / `KeyboardProtocol` own `DndConfig`,
      `DragItem`, `DropZone`, `DragConstraint`, `DragHandle`, `DropEffect`,
      `KeyboardNavigationConfig`, `KeyboardShortcut`, `FocusManagement`,
      `FocusTrapConfig`;
    - `@object-ui/types`' `mobile` module owns `SpecGestureConfig`,
      `SwipeGestureConfig`, `PinchGestureConfig`, `LongPressGestureConfig`,
      `TouchTargetConfig`, `TouchInteraction` (plus a new `SPEC_GESTURE_TYPES`
      runtime tuple), so `@object-ui/mobile`'s import paths are unchanged.

    Every shape is moved verbatim — same keys, same members, same optionality — so
    no hook or bridge changes behaviour. Consumers importing these names from
    `@object-ui/types` must import them from the owning package instead. Note the
    spec's _surviving_ `ConnectorConflictResolution` (`/integration`, connector sync)
    and `ConflictResolutionStrategy` (`/api`, route merge policy) are **different
    concepts** — do not re-point at them.

  - **`@object-ui/types` no longer re-exports `NotificationAction` or `EmbedConfig`**
    (objectstack#5015, PR objectstack#5300). Both were published `ui` vocabulary with
    no authoring door; no notification action was ever parsed from metadata and no
    iframe route ever read an embed config. The presentation enums
    (`NotificationType` / `NotificationSeverity` / `NotificationPosition`) and
    `SharingConfig` **survive** and are untouched — public form sharing still gates
    the anonymous endpoints on `allowAnonymous` + `publicLink`.
    `@object-ui/core`'s `SharingProtocol` keeps `resolveEmbedConfig` /
    `generateEmbedCode` against a locally declared `EmbedConfig`, so its surface is
    unchanged.
  - **`ThemeEngine` stops emitting nine retired CSS variable groups**
    (objectstack#5021 option 2, PR objectstack#5289). `theme.animation`,
    `theme.zIndex` and five typography groups (`fontSize` / `fontWeight` /
    `lineHeight` / `letterSpacing`, plus `fontFamily.heading` / `fontFamily.mono`)
    are tombstones the schema now rejects by name, so `--duration-*`, `--timing-*`,
    `--z-*`, `--font-size-*`, `--font-weight-*`, `--line-height-*`,
    `--letter-spacing-*`, `--font-heading` and `--font-mono` had become structurally
    dead code — no author could produce the input that reached them.
    `generateAnimationVars` and `generateZIndexVars` are removed from
    `@object-ui/core`, and `@object-ui/types` drops `Animation` / `ZIndex` /
    `AnimationSchema` / `ZIndexSchema`. **`theme.customVars` is the declared — and
    since #5021 the only — door**: each entry is emitted verbatim as
    `--<key>: <value>`, so a `--z-modal` or a `--duration-fast` goes there now.
    LIVE emission is untouched byte for byte: `colors`, `borderRadius`, `shadows`,
    `typography.fontFamily.base` (→ `--font-sans`) and `customVars`.
  - **`@object-ui/types`' `HttpMethodSchema` now binds the spec's
    `HttpMethodSubsetSchema`, and `HttpMethod` binds `HttpMethodSubset`**
    (objectstack#5832, PR objectstack#5976 — objectui#3499). The spec renamed its
    5-value UI subset because `schemaNameFromExportKey` strips the `Schema` suffix,
    so the 5-value and 7-value enums both published as `shared/HttpMethod` and the
    later write won — the emitted JSON Schema and reference page described only one
    of them. **The runtime domain is unchanged and this repo's exported names are
    unchanged**; this follows the rename without touching cross-package semantics.
    Deliberately NOT re-pointed at the spec's bare `HttpMethod`: that is the 7-value
    enum, and widening to it would let `method: 'HEAD'` compile and then throw in
    `HttpRequestSchema.parse()`.
  - **`dashboard.widgets[].actionUrl` / `actionType` / `actionIcon` / `aria` are
    refused, not stripped** (objectstack#5010, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove). A
    dashboard widget has no action button and never had one — every action the
    dashboard dispatches comes from `header.actions[]` — and no renderer ever applied
    the widget `aria`, so it promised accessibility compliance it did not deliver.
    A stale dashboard now gets a named error telling it where the affordance moved,
    instead of silently losing it. Run `os migrate meta --from 16` to rewrite.

- e6fdbdc: Reclaim the natural names `GestureType` and `GestureConfig` (objectui#3363).

  `@objectstack/spec` 17.0.0-rc.3 deleted the whole `ui/touch` module
  (objectstack#4988, PR objectstack#5321), vacating three names objectui had
  renamed **away from** in objectstack#4115 purely to avoid a collision. Two of
  those workarounds have now outlived their reason and are undone.

  ## Breaking, in FROM → TO form

  - `TouchGestureType` → **`GestureType`** — objectui's direction-fused recogniser
    vocabulary (`tap`, `swipe-left`, `swipe-up`, …).
  - `TouchGestureConfig` → **`GestureConfig`** — the flat gesture→`action` handler
    binding.

  Both are exported from `@object-ui/types` and re-exported by `@object-ui/mobile`.
  Nothing about either shape changed: same members, same optionality. Consumers
  import the new name; there is no other edit.

  **The old names are gone, not deprecated.** This follows the precedent set by the
  objectstack#4115 rename batch that introduced them, whose own migration note reads:
  "an alias would preserve exactly the ambiguity being removed". A deprecated alias
  would be worse here than in the general case, because the ambiguity these renames
  exist to prevent is between two same-named types — leaving `TouchGestureType`
  alive next to `GestureType` restores the two-spellings-one-concept problem while
  claiming to retire it.

  The retired spec vocabulary that used to hold these names still lives in
  `@object-ui/types`' `mobile` module under its deliberate `Spec…` prefix
  (`SpecGestureType`, `SpecGestureConfig`, `SwipeGestureConfig`, …), and that prefix
  is untouched — it is now the only thing distinguishing the two contracts, so
  `useSpecGesture` still maps one onto the other exactly as before.

  ## `PWAOfflineConfig` is deliberately NOT reclaimed

  The spec vacated `OfflineConfig` in the same retirement, but the spec was never
  its only claimant: that rename was a **cross-package arbitration between two
  objectui packages**, and `@object-ui/react` won it. `useOffline`'s config is the
  offline data/sync model key for key, so it holds the bare `OfflineConfig`, while
  this package's service-worker route cache stays `PWAOfflineConfig`
  (objectui#3156 / objectui#3159).

  Before objectui#3560 that name reached `@object-ui/react` from the spec, so the
  spec-side tripwire covered it by accident. Since the retirement it is declared
  locally in `packages/react/src/hooks/useOffline.ts`, which means the spec's
  vacancy no longer says anything about whether the name is free — it is not.
  Reclaiming it would put two different `OfflineConfig` shapes on the public
  surface of two packages that are routinely imported together, which is the exact
  ambiguity objectstack#4115 renamed it away from.

  `page-nav-misc-spec-parity.test.ts` now pins that reason directly instead of
  leaving it as prose: it asserts `@object-ui/react` still declares
  `OfflineConfig`, and its failure message tells the next reader that the reclaim
  has become available if it ever stops.

### Minor Changes

- 726b89c: `@object-ui/types` stops declaring sixteen symbols under names `@objectstack/spec` owns (objectui#3156, objectstack#4115).

  Seven are now **derived** from the spec, nine are **renamed** to the local
  dialect they always were. Both halves remove the same hazard: a local
  declaration under a spec export's name reads as the spec's own definition to
  the next reader, so a copy that is merely _correct today_ is a planted premise
  tomorrow.

  **Derived** — the spec now supplies the keys, by reference:

  | symbol                   | derivation                                                                        |
  | :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `ActionParam`            | `z.input<typeof ActionParamSchema>`, `type` widened to the local legacy spellings |
  | `CreateExportJobRequest` | `Omit<CreateExportJobInput, 'object'>` (`object` is the method argument)          |
  | `CreateExportJobResult`  | re-export from `@objectstack/spec/contracts`                                      |
  | `ImportRowResult`        | re-export from `@objectstack/spec/api`                                            |
  | `NavigationArea`         | spec keys, with `navigation` / `visible` pinned locally                           |
  | `NavigationAreaSchema`   | `specFieldsExcept(NavigationAreaSchema.shape, …)`                                 |
  | `Theme`                  | re-export of the spec's `ThemeInput` (the authoring shape)                        |
  | `ExportJobFormat`        | re-export of the spec's `ExportFormat`                                            |

  Four of these close real gaps rather than tidy names. `ActionParam` never
  declared `reference` — the key `resolveActionParams()` actually reads for an
  inline lookup target — nor `defaultFromRow`, which the metadata designer's own
  inspector writes; it also narrowed `visible` to a bare string although the
  resolver has always accepted the `{ dialect, source }` envelope too.
  `CreateExportJobResult.createdAt` and `ImportRowResult.action` were optional
  here and required by the server, leaving every consumer a branch that could
  never run. And `NavigationArea`'s `id` now carries the spec's own length rule
  instead of accepting any string.

  **Renamed** — same word, different concept:

  | was                | now                      | why                                                                                                                            |
  | :----------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `FileMetadata`     | `UploadedFileMetadata`   | field-VALUE payload (`url`, `original_name`), not the storage file record                                                      |
  | `GestureType`      | `TouchGestureType`       | direction-fused (`swipe-left`), not the spec's type+direction pair                                                             |
  | `GestureConfig`    | `TouchGestureConfig`     | gesture→`action` binding, not per-gesture tuning                                                                               |
  | `OfflineConfig`    | `PWAOfflineConfig`       | service-worker route caching, not the offline data/sync model                                                                  |
  | `PageRegion`       | `PageNodeRegion`         | region of the renderer page NODE, holding `SchemaNode`s                                                                        |
  | `PageRegionSchema` | `PageNodeRegionSchema`   | zod twin of the above                                                                                                          |
  | `ResponsiveConfig` | `MobileResponsiveConfig` | mobile box config, not the spec's SDUI grid contract                                                                           |
  | `WidgetManifest`   | `RuntimeWidgetManifest`  | SDUI component manifest, not the field-widget plugin manifest                                                                  |
  | `WidgetSource`     | `RuntimeWidgetSource`    | `module`/`inline`/`registry` loader union — and its `inline` carries a resolved component where the spec's carries source code |

  **Migration**: the old names are gone, not deprecated — an alias would preserve
  exactly the ambiguity being removed. Import the new name; nothing about the
  shapes changed. `@object-ui/types` already re-exports the spec's own
  `SpecResponsiveConfig`, and `@object-ui/react`'s `useOffline` config remains the
  spec-shaped `OfflineConfig`, so both concepts stay reachable under
  distinguishable names.

  Each rename carries a bidirectional tripwire
  (`packages/types/src/__tests__/page-nav-misc-spec-parity.test.ts`): it fails if
  the spec ever claims the new name, and also if the spec retires the old one —
  at which point the natural name can be taken back rather than the workaround
  outliving its reason.

### Patch Changes

- 4be43e2: **Page-mode record forms (`editMode: 'page'`).** New per-object metadata flag that opts a record's create/edit form into a dedicated full-screen route (`/apps/:appName/:objectName/new`, `/apps/:appName/:objectName/record/:recordId/edit`). Two new declarative actions `navigate_create` and `navigate_edit` open these routes from JSON action buttons. Default modal behavior is preserved for objects that do not set `editMode`.

  **`@object-ui/plugin-list` & `@object-ui/plugin-detail`: `ComponentRegistry` singleton fix.** Both plugins' Vite configs now mark all `@object-ui/*` packages as external so each plugin no longer bundles its own private copy of `@object-ui/core`. Cross-plugin component lookups now resolve correctly from the same singleton registry. `plugin-list` dist shrank from multi-MB to 67 kB (gzip 16 kB); `plugin-detail` to 124 kB (gzip 28 kB).

  **`@object-ui/app-shell` `CreateViewDialog` churn fix.** `existingSet` is now memoised on the joined string key of `existingLabels` rather than the raw array reference, preventing the name-suggest `useEffect` from re-firing on every parent render.

  **CI fixes.** `ReportViewer` conditional-formatting test now accepts both `rgb(...)` and hex color representations. `ObjectView` i18n mocks rewritten to mirror the real hook shapes (`useObjectTranslation`, `useObjectLabel`).

### Patch Changes

- a2d7023: End-user feature batch — forms, designer history, import/export, and PWA offline sync.

  **Forms (`@object-ui/fields`, `@object-ui/providers`)**

  - `FileField`: native `<input capture="environment">` camera capture for mobile devices, plus a uploading-progress indicator driven by `UploadProvider`.
  - `ImageField`: per-image inline crop/rotate via the lazy-loaded `ImageCropperDialog` (canvas-based, zero new deps).
  - New `UploadProvider` in `@object-ui/providers` with pluggable adapters for S3 and Azure Blob (plus the default object-URL adapter for local previews). XHR-based with progress, abort, and retry.
  - `LookupField`: `lookup.dependsOn: string | string[]` to chain dependent lookups (e.g. State depends on Country); the trigger is gated until parent values are present and the OData `$filter` is built automatically.

  **Container-aware widget widths (`@object-ui/components`)**

  - New `useResizeObserver(ref)` hook exposing `{ width, height }` of any element. SSR-safe; reads the initial size via `getBoundingClientRect`.
  - `plugin-gantt` and `plugin-kanban` now react to their container size instead of `window.innerWidth`, so they behave correctly inside split panels and dashboards.

  **Designer history (`@object-ui/plugin-designer`)**

  - `useUndoRedo` (and therefore `useDesignerHistory`) gains `persistKey` + `storage` options to round-trip the undo/redo stack through `sessionStorage`, plus a `clearPersisted()` cleanup helper. Drafts now survive accidental tab refreshes.
  - New `<HistoryPanel>` component renders the timeline visually with one-click jump-to-checkpoint via the new `jumpTo(index)` API.

  **Import wizard (`@object-ui/plugin-grid`)**

  - Saved column-mapping templates: name, save, re-apply, and delete via a new template bar in the mapping step. Persisted under `objectui:import-templates:${objectName}` (override via `templateStorageKey` / `templateStorage`).
  - Inline validation correction: cells with errors in the preview step are now editable; corrections feed straight into the import without requiring a re-upload, with green-bar status indicators for fixed rows.

  **PWA offline sync (`@object-ui/mobile`)**

  - New `MemoryOfflineQueue` / `IndexedDbOfflineQueue` (`createOfflineQueue()` picks the best backend) backed by IndexedDB.
  - `createOfflineDataSource(inner, { queue })` wraps any DataSource so mutations issued while offline (or that fail with a network-style error) are queued and replayed in order on reconnect. Includes `replay()`, `drop()`, `clear()`, `pending()`, an `onChange` notifier, and an opt-in `resolveConflict` hook for stale-write conflicts.
  - New `useOfflineSync(source)` hook exposes `{ isOnline, pending, isReplaying, replay, drop, clear }` and auto-replays on the browser's `online` event.
  - `getServiceWorkerSource(opts)` emits a customisable Service Worker that pre-caches the app shell, applies network-first to API requests, and broadcasts `REPLAY_QUEUE` to clients on Background Sync. `requestBackgroundSync(tag)` registers a one-shot sync from the page.
