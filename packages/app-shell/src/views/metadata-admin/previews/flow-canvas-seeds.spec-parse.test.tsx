/**
 * **Every node shape the flow designer SEEDS must survive the spec's own
 * loader** (#3316).
 *
 * The designer does not only render authored metadata — it *produces* it. Two
 * places mint a brand-new node before the author has touched anything:
 *
 * 1. `defaultNodeExtras()` (`flow-canvas-parts.tsx`), spread into every node
 *    added from the palette or inserted on an edge (`FlowCanvas` `addNode` /
 *    `insertOnEdge`).
 * 2. `addReviseLoop()` (`FlowCanvas.tsx`), the one-click ADR-0044 revision
 *    loop, which writes its `wait` node inline.
 *
 * When a spec property is retired via `retiredKey()` (`z.never().optional()`)
 * a seed still writing it is not "an extra key that gets stripped" — it is a
 * hard `FlowNodeSchema.parse()` error, so the designer emits metadata its own
 * runtime refuses and publish 422s on a flow the author never edited. That is
 * exactly what `waitEventConfig.onTimeout` did between spec 17 (framework
 * #4158) and #3316: the label overrides for the retired keys were dropped from
 * `i18n.ts`, and the hand-written form dropped the fields
 * (`inspectors/flow-node-config.ts`), but the two *seed* sites kept writing
 * `onTimeout: 'fail'`.
 *
 * This file is the ratchet that makes the NEXT retirement land red here
 * instead of at publish time. It renders (rather than staying a pure `.test.ts`
 * in the cheap `unit` project) because the second producer only exists inside
 * a React callback — and keeping both producers in one file is the point: the
 * #3316 failure mode was fixing the visible consumer and missing the other.
 *
 * **Two criteria, deliberately different** (key-vs-value reachability):
 *
 * - The spec-structured sibling blocks (`waitEventConfig` / `connectorConfig` /
 *   `boundaryConfig`) are strict objects and their seeds are complete, so the
 *   assertion is full `safeParse` green on the whole node — a *value* verdict.
 * - The `config`-rooted seeds (`approval` / `notify` / `http`) are invisible to
 *   `FlowNodeSchema`, whose `config` is a permissive `z.record()`; and they are
 *   deliberately PARTIAL (an author still supplies notify's `title`, http's
 *   `url`), so demanding full parse green would assert something the seed never
 *   promised. Their assertion is therefore key-level: every seeded key must be
 *   a live, declared key of the spec's published node-config Zod — never a
 *   `[REMOVED]` tombstone.
