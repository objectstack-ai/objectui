/**
 * What an object's declared field `defaultValue`s mean to a CREATE form —
 * which ones it seeds (#4047) and which ones excuse it from the client-side
 * `required` rule (#4069).
 *
 * Both halves hang off ONE classifier, {@link isRuntimeDefault}: a default the
 * server resolves per insert is neither seedable nor missing. Keeping the two
 * consumers on one predicate is the point of this module — a second copy would
 * be free to disagree about, say, a CEL envelope, and then a form would seed a
 * field it also refuses to submit. Since #4085 that classifier LIVES in
 * `@object-ui/core` (this module re-exports it) so a third consumer — the
 * `requiredWhen` suppression inside `resolveFieldRuleState` — reads the very
 * same one from a package `@object-ui/components` is allowed to depend on.
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * A CREATE form starts from a blank record, so the values it opens with are
 * whatever the form puts there. `ObjectForm` derived them from the object
 * schema's `defaultValue`s; the sectioned/overlay containers (Modal / Drawer /
 * Tabbed / Split / Wizard) did not, and the console's create dialog is one of
 * those — a field declared `required: true, defaultValue: 'draft'` opened
 * empty, with a required marker, forcing the user to pick a value the system
 * already knew (and putting every neighbouring option one click away).
 *
 * ## Which spellings are honoured: the producer's, in the producer's order
 *
 * Two declarations name a field's initial value, and this module reads both
 * exactly as the server's insert path (`ObjectQL.applyFieldDefaults`) does —
 * the form previews the value omitting the field would store, never a value
 * of its own:
 *
 *   1. `field.defaultValue`, whenever it is present (`!= null`).
 *   2. Otherwise, the option a field's option list marks `default: true`
 *      (`@objectstack/spec`'s `SelectOptionSchema.default`). The engine falls
 *      back to it since objectstack#7246 (`resolveOptionDefault`); see
 *      {@link optionListDefault} for the rule, which mirrors that method.
 *
 * Until objectui#11914 this module read (1) only, on the then-true ground
 * that the server read nothing else — so the tutorial's required `priority`
 * and `status` selects, which mark an option and declare no `defaultValue`,
 * opened on the placeholder while a create that omitted them stored the
 * marked options. The producer moved; the reading follows it. A flag the
 * server does NOT apply (an option marked beside a present `defaultValue`)
 * is not seeded either, so there is still exactly one default contract.
 *
 * ## Which defaults are seeded, and why the rest are skipped
 *
 * Only STATIC defaults. A `defaultValue` may also be an *instruction* the
 * server resolves per insert:
 *
 *   - a runtime token — `'NOW()'` / `'current_user'`, the whole
 *     `DEFAULT_VALUE_TOKENS` family from `@objectstack/spec/data`
 *   - a CEL Expression envelope — `{ dialect: 'cel', source: 'today()' }`
 *
 * Seeding those literally is worse than leaving the control empty: the string
 * `NOW()` lands in a datetime input and is then SUBMITTED as that field's
 * value, which suppresses the server-side resolution the declaration asked for
 * (`applyFieldDefaults` only fills fields that arrive empty). Skipping them
 * leaves the field absent from the create payload, which is precisely the case
 * the engine resolves. `ObjectForm` had been seeding them verbatim — that is
 * fixed here along with the missing-seeding half.
 *
 * ONE token is additionally RESOLVED (not seeded literally) when the caller
 * threads a {@link SeedContext}: `current_user`, whose engine-side resolution
 * is "the acting user's id" — a value this very session knows exactly. That is
 * the "surface what the server WILL supply" follow-up the #4069 notes promised
 * (#5683): the seeded id is the same one `applyFieldDefaults` would stamp, so
 * submitting it explicitly and omitting it are equivalent by construction.
 *
 * ## Create only
 *
 * An EDIT form shows a persisted row and must show it as the server holds it.
 * Folding a default in over a column the record leaves unset would arm a silent
 * write of a value the user never chose, on the next save of any other field.
 * Callers gate on create; this module never sees the mode.

 * published function reads them, and every member added here is published
 * surface somebody then has to keep.
 *
 * Exported and published (objectui#7324) because `omitServerResolvedDefaults`

 * renderer has to hold that schema in a variable or a prop, and until now it
 * could not name the variable's type. Structural typing meant such a host
 * still compiled by writing the shape out by hand — which is a copy of a
 * producer-owned shape in every consumer, invisible to every gate until the
 * producer's shape moves.
 *
 * `FieldDefaults`, not `ObjectSchema`: `deriveMasterDetail.ts` holds a
 * different shape that used to carry the same `ObjectSchemaLike` name, and the
 * two are NOT interchangeable — see `ChildObjectSchemaLike` there. This one is
 * the stricter of the pair (its field values are pinned, not `any`), so a
 * value legal here is legal there but not the reverse.
 *
 * NOT `@object-ui/types`' `ObjectSchemaMetadata`: that type requires `name`
 * and requires a `type` on every field. `isCurrentUserSeedField` below reads
 * the target as `reference`, the one spelling the spec declares and ObjectUI
 * reads (objectui#11070 round 4).

/**
 * The `required` a form should ENFORCE on this field, given the mode (#4069).
 *
 * A field may declare `required: true` alongside a runtime `defaultValue`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * remind_at: Field.datetime({ required: true, defaultValue: 'NOW()' }),
 * ```
 *
 * That is coherent authoring, not an error — storage-level required, with the
 * value guaranteed by the producer (`ObjectQL.applyFieldDefaults` resolves the
 * token for every field that arrives absent or null). But a CREATE form cannot
 * seed it (see {@link isRuntimeDefault}), so the control opens empty; enforcing
 * `required` there refuses the submit with *nothing sensible for the user to
 * type* — the declaration already said what the value is, and omitting the
 * field is precisely what makes the server supply it. The field is not
 * "missing"; it is server-owned.
 *
 * So in CREATE mode a runtime default suppresses the rule. Three boundaries,
 * each pinned in `createDefaults.test.tsx`:
 *
 *   - **Create only.** An EDIT form shows a persisted row, where the token was
 *     already resolved at insert; blanking a required column there is a real
 *     removal of a value and stays refused.
 *   - **Runtime defaults only.** A STATIC literal default IS seeded into the
 *     control (#4068), so if the user clears it they have removed a value that
 *     was there — `required` still fires.
 *   - **The rule, not the field.** Suppression only removes the "must not be
 *     empty" check. A value the user DOES type is still submitted normally and
 *     wins over the declared default.
 *
 * Note this drops the required MARKER (and `aria-required`) too, since both are
 * driven by this one boolean — which is the honest reading: in create mode the
 * user really is not required to provide the value. Surfacing what the server
 * WILL supply is issue #4069's option B, a separate follow-up card.
 *
 * The CONDITIONAL spelling (`requiredWhen`) reaches the same verdict, ruled
 * identically in #4085 — but it cannot be decided here, because it is resolved
 * downstream against the live record. It is suppressed in the one evaluator
 * that resolves it, `resolveFieldRuleState`, which reads the same fact off
 * `@object-ui/core`'s `isServerOwnedValue` (and therefore the same
 * {@link isRuntimeDefault} classifier this function reads). That evaluator
 * subsumes this function on every path that threads the fact; this static
 * answer stays because it is also the one the containers publish as the
 * FormField's `required` flag, and because it is what re-runs when a form VIEW
 * restates `required` over the object field (see `normalizeSectionField`).
