/**
 * Every `AnyComponentSchema` arm is a NAMED export of `./zod` — or it is
 * ledgered below with the reason it is not (objectui#8784).
 *
 * ## The defect this closes
 *
 * objectui#7917 found that 2 of the union's arms had no named export from
 * `@object-ui/types/zod`, so `breadcrumb` and `object-tree` could not be
 * validated on their own: the schemas existed, were maintained, and were
 * applied by the union, while no consumer could name them. PR #8777 repaired
 * both. Nothing kept it repaired.
 *
 * `./zod` is this package's ONLY zod subpath (`packages/types/package.json`
 * maps it to `dist/zod/index.zod.js`) and `index.zod.ts` carries no star
 * re-export — every name on that barrel is written out by hand. So an arm added
 * to a category module and not to the barrel is declared-and-unreachable, and
 * TWO of the three ways that has happened were silent:
 *
 *  - `BreadcrumbSchema` was on the barrel at creation and was dropped by
 *    `d908a82f4`, a "Fix schema duplication" dedup, as COLLATERAL — no
 *    decision, no diagnostic — and stayed gone for 41 commits while this
 *    directory's `README.md` kept advertising it;
 *  - `ObjectTreeSchema` was never added at all: PR #1892's file list omits the
 *    barrel.
 *
 * ⭐ The third way is neither of those, and it is the one live on this tree:
 * a DECLARED deferral. `507b61bf7` (PR #8763, objectui#8499, merged
 * 2026-09-09T08:11:20Z) armed four new arms in `layout.zod.ts` and
 * `form.zod.ts` and left the barrel alone ON PURPOSE. Its own changeset,
 * `.changeset/8499-node-slot-registered-arms.md`, declares the omission, the
 * metric it moves, and the reason: exporting a `SemanticElementSchema` /
 * `HtmlElementSchema` pair "would publish a NAMED authoring surface (`z.enum`
 * families, not per-tag schemas) that this card's ruling does not cover", so
 * "the metric is left to move and said out loud instead" and "whoever wants
 * the number back down should treat naming these families as its own
 * decision". objectui#8499's ceiling review raised the omission as blocking
 * F1 (`5597569641`), a delta commit carrying the eight barrel lines was
 * prepared, and the review then PASSed the deferral "on the surface-widening
 * reason alone" (`5598263402`). ⛔ So this is NOT `d908a82f4` recurring: no
 * one forgot, and the four rows below say "a decision is owed", not "someone
 * slipped".
 *
 * ⚠️ It is still exactly what this pin is for, and the reason is where the
 * declaration LIVES. A `.changeset/*.md` is consumed and deleted at release —
 * measured, e.g. `59f61cfb8` "chore: release packages (#4655)" removes the
 * batch it versioned. The absence outlives its own explanation, and once the
 * explanation is gone a deferred non-export and a collateral drop are the same
 * two lines of nothing in `index.zod.ts`. The rows below move that reason into
 * the tree, where it is re-read on every run and deleted only when it stops
 * being true.
 *
 * ## Why the existing checks could not see it
 *
 *  - `zod-mirror-parity.test.ts` reads its export population with
 *    `/^export const NAME/m` over `src/zod/*.zod.ts`. That pattern matches a
 *    DECLARATION; a barrel line is `export { NAME } from './x.js'`, which it
 *    cannot match — so the census is structurally blind to a missing
 *    re-export even though `index.zod.ts` is one of the files it reads.
 *  - No test pinned an export list or a count on `index.zod.ts`. The per-name
 *    presence assertions that exist (`crud-retirement-5373.test.ts`,
 *    `block-family-retired-4895.test.ts`, `breadcrumb-object-tree-nameable-7917.test.ts`)
 *    each pin the names their own card was about, which is one arm at a time.
 *  - `scripts/measure-strict-authoring-face.mjs` does compute it, and is
 *    self-described `MEASUREMENT THROWAWAY`: no `package.json` script and no
 *    workflow runs it.
 *
 * ## The two properties this pin is built on
 *
 * 1. ⭐ **It reads the BARREL, not the modules.** The population is
 *    `Object.entries` of the `../zod/index.zod.js` module namespace — the
 *    runtime export surface itself, so a re-export counts and a declaration
 *    that never reached the barrel does not. A pin that read `^export const`
 *    from the same files as the parity census would have rebuilt the blind spot
 *    under a new filename. (The category modules ARE imported below, but only
 *    to turn a failing arm into a name a reader can act on; they never decide
 *    the verdict. `namesOn` is given ONE namespace and the real reading passes
 *    it the barrel.)
 *
 * 2. ⭐ **It matches by IDENTITY, not by name.** Adversarial probing of #8777's
 *    pin found that `export { NavigationSchema as BreadcrumbSchema }` — the
 *    PARENT sub-union re-exported under the arm's name — satisfies a name-based
 *    check and every behavioural leg of that pin. Only identity catches it, and
 *    the arm's identity chain deliberately starts at the union OPTION, so no
 *    containing union is ever a candidate. `the parent union under the arm's
 *    name is still unnamed` below is that property as a control.
 *
 * ⛔ The arm list is DERIVED on every run and no count is hard-coded: arms land
 * (four did, mid-card), and a number stated in a comment that nothing checks is
 * objectui#8606. The only bound asserted against the real union is a floor read
 * off that union's own top-level option count, which is what proves the walk
 * recursed rather than stopping at those top-level members — the reviewer's
 * first census stopped there and reported a plausible, fully-populated,
 * entirely wrong "13 arms / 2 literals". ⚠️ Those 13 are 12 sub-unions plus one
 * object arm (`AppComponentSchema`, an arm at depth 1), not 13 sub-unions; the
 * floor holds either way, and the count is read off the union rather than
 * written down here.
