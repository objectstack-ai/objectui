/**
 * THE icon-name seam (objectui#5935). One tokeniser, one rename map, one
 * lookup into lucide's runtime `icons` record — for the whole repo.
 *
 * ## What this module does, and the line it does not cross
 *
 * Its whole contract is `name -> component`, and `null` when nothing matches.
 * ⛔ It does NOT decide what a surface draws when the answer is `null`. That
 * is the maintainer ruling of 2026-09-03 (objectui#5935, comment 5523286738,
 * verbatim 「同意你的建议」, option C), taken over the 2026-08-31 shape that
 * would have given this function an `onUnresolvable: 'placeholder' | 'null'`
 * parameter. The reason that parameter is absent is measured, not stylistic:
 * the tree has FOUR unresolvable behaviours, not two —
 *
 *   - `null`                          — this module's callers by default,
 *                                       `plugin-list/TabBar`, `plugin-view/ViewSwitcher`
 *   - `SquareDashed` placeholder+warn — `renderers/basic/icon.tsx` (objectui#5631,
 *                                       maintainer 2026-08-22, 一字不动)
 *   - an `Inbox` fallback glyph       — `plugin-detail/RelatedList`, `plugin-list/ListView`
 *   - a 3-character name chip         — `app-shell` `previews/ActionPreview`
 *
 * — so a two-valued knob could not have expressed the tree it was meant to
 * consolidate, and widening it to four would have published a presentation
 * decision on a lookup function. Each call site keeps its own fallback, at the
 * call site, visibly. `resolveIcon(x) ?? Inbox` is not a hidden divergence: it
 * is local and there is nothing for it to disagree with, unlike the three
 * tokenisers this seam replaced.
 *
 * ## ⛔ A new icon-rendering container does NOT bring its own resolver
 *
 * Ruling point 4 of 2026-08-31 (comment 5472612351, verbatim 「同意」):
 * 「本裁定后新容器 ⛔ 不得再自带解析器,一律走 seam」. This is mechanically
 * enforced, not merely asked for — `scripts/check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs`
 * rediscovers every module that named-imports lucide's `icons` record and
 * indexes it, and fails when the discovered set differs from its declared
 * census in EITHER direction. That census is now this file alone. A container
 * that hand-rolls a lookup turns the gate red on the commit that adds it.
 *
 * ## The tokeniser is MEASURED, not chosen
 *
 * `split(/[-_\s]+/)` with `Home -> House` applied universally, established by
 * the pre-dispatch enumeration required by the 2026-08-31 ruling
 * (objectui#5935, comment 5522254814) — four independent instruments, each
 * with a control that fired in the same run: a cross-product upper bound over
 * every authored name x all seven surfaces, a bound-free differential over
 * 8,298 spellings derived from all 1,767 live record keys, an AST sweep over
 * 349,813 string literals (25 forking literals, ALL in the same direction),
 * and the objectui#5631 pin. Its regression set is EMPTY in all three readings.
 *
 * ⛔ `split('-')` — what five of the seven sites used — is not adoptable: it
 * regresses 4,748 name-surface pairs in the bound-free space, stripping the two
 * regex surfaces of every snake_case and space-separated spelling they resolve
 * today. `split(/[-_\s]/)` is byte-identical to the adopted spelling over
 * 51,449 hostile spellings, and `.filter(Boolean)` is inert in this pipeline
 * (capitalising the empty string yields the empty string, and joining it
 * contributes nothing) — three spellings, two behaviours, one adopted.
 *
 * Why widening cannot regress anything, structurally: NO key of the record
 * contains `_`, whitespace or `-` (measured: 0 of 1767, with a firing control —
 * 95 keys contain a digit). So whenever splitting on `-` alone produces a live
 * key, that key contained no `_` and no whitespace, so no hyphen-token did
 * either, so splitting further changes nothing. The old resolving sets are
 * strict SUBSETS of this one.
 *
 * ## The module path stays `renderers/action/`
 *
 * It is where the shared resolver already lived and where sixteen importers,
 * the gate's declared census and three suites already point. Moving it would
 * be churn priced in merge conflicts against a card whose acceptance criterion
 * is that nothing observable moves.

 * The ONE rename map: names lucide RETIRED from its runtime `icons` record.

/**
 * The live record key whose component is `icon`, for DIAGNOSTICS only.
 *
 * ## Why this exists, and why it is a search rather than a table
 *
 * lucide retires a spelling by dropping it from the runtime `icons` record
 * while keeping the deprecated named export — and the retired export and its
 * live spelling are THE SAME OBJECT (`Smile === FaceSlightlySmiling` is
 * `true`). So the replacement for a retired name is derivable by identity, and
 * `scripts/check-lucide-icon-record-names.mjs` already derives it that way at
 * gate time, in as many words: "When it has to name a replacement it derives
 * one, by identity: the retired export and its live spelling are the same
 * object, so the live key is looked up in the record rather than remembered."
 *
 * objectui#9204 needs the same answer at RUNTIME, because a retired spelling is
 * now refused rather than silently degraded and the refusal has to name the
 * current spelling. ⛔ A hand-kept retired-to-live table is not the way to get
 * it: it is the same defect one level up — it ages the moment lucide retires
 * the next name, it ages SILENTLY, and in this package it would also land on
 * the eager path the same card is emptying. This searches the record the caller
 * already pays for.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Identity is the FIRST answer, not the only one — measured
 *
 * Identity holds only while both halves came from the same module instance, and
 * that is not guaranteed: reached through `lucide-react/dynamic.mjs` the icon
 * module can resolve into a DIFFERENT graph from the one `icons` came from, and
 * then `===` is false for two components that are the same icon. Measured under
 * this repo's vitest: `icons.FaceSlightlySmiling === (await
 * dynamicIconImports['smile']()).default` is `false`, while both carry
 * `displayName: 'FaceSlightlySmiling'`.
 *
 * So the fallback is lucide's own `displayName`, which `createLucideIcon` sets
 * from the icon's file name — still DERIVED from lucide and still not a table.
 * ⛔ It is not trusted blindly: a name is returned only after it is confirmed to
 * be a live key of the record, so an unknown component cannot name itself into
 * an answer.
 *
 * ⛔ It decides nothing. Nothing resolves differently because of it; `null` here
 * only means the diagnostic omits a replacement.
