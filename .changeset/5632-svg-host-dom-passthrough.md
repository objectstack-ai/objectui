'@object-ui/components': patch

`ui:icon` and `ui:spinner` route their host spread through `toDomProps`
(objectui#5632, the `BARE_SPREAD_ON_SVG` slice of objectui#5574).

Both renderers forwarded their whole prop bag to the SVG they render, so every
authored SDUI key on the node became an attribute — 14 per target, and
`icon="check"` on all 71 icon nodes in the schema catalog. The two nodes declare
different keys, and each renderer consumes its own node's keys by name:
`IconSchema` (`packages/types/src/layout.ts`) against the pass-through docblock
in `renderers/basic/icon.tsx`, and `SpinnerSchema`
(`packages/types/src/feedback.ts`) against the one in
`renderers/feedback/spinner.tsx`. `icon` and `color` are `IconSchema`'s alone —
`SpinnerSchema` declares neither. Read those two declarations for what they
carry; this paragraph deliberately copies no member list. So the SDUI
pass-through list withholds nothing they need.

Two user-visible behaviours change, both of which were invisible to the DOM-leak
gate because the judge counts `stroke` / `width` / `height` as legitimate on an
SVG host:

- **`ui:spinner` now spins.** Its computed `class` (`animate-spin` plus the size
  class) was being overwritten by the `className` carried in the spread, so a
  spinner rendered through `SchemaRenderer` had neither. It is merged now.
- **A sized `ui:spinner` no longer emits invalid dimensions.** `size` is an enum
  (`sm`/`md`/`lg`/`xl`) and the spread handed the string to lucide's numeric
  `size` prop, putting `width="lg" height="lg"` on the element.

Also: an `icon` node's `color` is a Tailwind class (as `IconSchema.color`
declares, and as every authored value in the catalog uses). It reached lucide's
`color` prop through the spread as well, emitting an invalid
`stroke="text-red-500"` beside the class that does the real work; only the class
path remains. An authored raw CSS colour (e.g. `color: "red"`) no longer tints
the glyph through that accident — declare the colour as a class, which is the
declared contract.
