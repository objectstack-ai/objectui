 * objectui#6882 — `DataTableSchema` DECLARES the two schema-level keys
 * `data-table.tsx` has always read: `renderCellEditor` and `cellClassName`
 * (maintainer ruling 2026-08-30, option A).
 *
 * ## Why this pin is compile-time, and why a runtime pin would measure nothing
 *
 * The enforcement being added is a TYPE declaration. `data-table` behaves
 * IDENTICALLY before and after it: both keys were already read on the
 * production path — `renderCellEditor` through an `(schema as any)` cast,
 * `cellClassName` by destructuring into the class of the three UTILITY body
 * cells (selection, row-number, row-actions; a data cell folds the per-column
 * `TableColumn.cellClassName` instead, never this key — measured in the DOM by
 * `components/src/renderers/complex/__tests__/data-table-cellClassName-population-6921.test.tsx`,
 * objectui#6921) — so no render changes, no runtime value changes, and a
 * rendering test is blind to the whole change. What can fail is a COMPILE.
 * Same reading as `plugin-grid/src/__tests__/dataTableSchemaSlot-6459.test.ts`
 * next door.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The index signature is what made the naive pin vacuous
 *
 * `DataTableSchema extends BaseSchema`, and `BaseSchema` carried
 * `[key: string]: any` until objectui#8347. So `DataTableSchema['renderCellEditor']`
 * resolved to `any` whether or not the key was declared, and every "is this key
 * there?" spelling written over the raw type answered `true` for EVERY string —
 * including `bogusKeyNobodyDeclared`. A pin written that way was green before
 * the fix, green after it, and measured nothing.
 *
 * `Declared<>` below strips the signature so NON-MEMBERSHIP can exist, which is
 * the only state in which a membership question has an answer (since
 * objectui#8347 the strip is the identity on `DataTableSchema`).
 *
 * ## ⚠️ …and `extends` alone is vacuous a second way
 *
 * `Expect<X extends true ? true : false>` is satisfied by `never` (assignable
 * to everything) and by `any`. `Equal<>` below is the invariant
 * (function-parameter-identity) comparison instead, so neither passes.
 *
 * ## How the DIRECTION is proved, rather than asserted
 *
 * Four `@ts-expect-error` directives below are the load-bearing half. TypeScript
 * reports an UNUSED `@ts-expect-error` as an error (TS2578), so each of them is
 * a claim that the instrument REFUSES something:
 *
 *   - `Expect<false>` must be refused → the assertion helper has teeth;
 *   - `Equal<never, true>` and `Equal<any, true>` must resolve `false` → the
 *     comparison is invariant, not `extends`-shaped;
 *   - `IsDeclaredOn<'…probe…'>` must resolve `false` → the strip really removed
 *     the index signature, so a non-member is answerable.
 *
 * Break any part of the instrument — make `Expect` accept anything, make
 * `Equal` bivariant, make `Declared` a no-op — and this file goes RED on the
 * now-unused directive rather than quietly passing. That is the property the
 * positive assertions borrow their meaning from.

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * objectui#6940 — `DataTableSchema.rowActions` is a BOOLEAN on the mirror too
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Maintainer ruling 2026-09-02 (director seat, summon #8, verbatim
 * 「7189 A  其他同意」), option A: the zod mirror in `../zod/data-display.zod.ts`
 * becomes `z.boolean().optional()`, aligned with the TS declaration
 * (`rowActions?: boolean`), the renderer's destructuring default
 * (`rowActions = false`), the registered input (`type: 'boolean'`),
 * `defaultProps` and the docblock example. Option B (a `boolean | array` union)
 * was NOT taken: it would permanently accept a shape the renderer only
 * truthiness-tests.
 *
 * ## Why the REFUSAL is the load-bearing half
 *
 * This is a NARROWING. A mirror that accepted both `true` and `[]` would
 * satisfy a "`true` validates" assertion on its own — that assertion was green
 * BEFORE this change for the array spelling and would stay green after a
 * union. So the pin that carries the ruling's meaning is
 * `_rowActionsArrayIsRefused` below, and it asserts not merely that the parse
 * fails but that EVERY issue it raises is ON `rowActions` — a document refused
 * for some unrelated reason would otherwise read as a passing narrowing pin.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Two different keys are named `rowActions`
 *
 * `ObjectGridSchema.rowActions` (`../zod/objectql.zod.ts`, TS twin
 * `../objectql.ts` `interface ObjectGridSchema`) is `z.array(z.string())` — the
 * legacy bare-NAME action list, a genuinely different key that is correct as it
 * stands and is NOT touched by this ruling. The last test below pins that
 * separation, so a later sweep that "harmonises the two `rowActions`" turns red
 * here instead of silently retyping a key no ruling covers.
