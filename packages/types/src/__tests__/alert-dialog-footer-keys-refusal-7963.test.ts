/**
 * `cancelLabel`, `confirmLabel` and `confirmVariant` are REFUSED on the
 * `alert-dialog` node, on both faces (objectui#7963, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove;
 * maintainer ruling 2026-09-10). `cancelText` / `actionText` are the surviving
 * spellings — and `confirmVariant` has NO survivor at all.
 *
 * ## What this is, and what it deliberately is NOT
 *
 * objectui#7104 declared the keys the renderer READS (`content`, `cancelText`,
 * `actionText`, `onAction`) and, in the same breath, LEFT this trio declared and
 * unread on purpose — its pin says so out loud ("the pins below record today's
 * state so that the PR which retires them re-derives these lines deliberately
 * rather than passing unnoticed"). This file is that retirement; that pin is
 * RE-POINTED, not deleted, so the closure stays asserted rather than becoming a
 * silent absence. The same discipline objectui#8871 applied to objectui#7926's
 * deliberately-left `breadcrumbs`.
 *
 * ## Why a REFUSAL and not a bare deletion
 *
 * `BaseSchemaCore` ends `.passthrough()` and the TS `BaseSchema` closes with
 * `[key: string]: any`, so a dropped MEMBER key is KEPT, not refused. Deleting
 * the three declarations would have left the silent accept exactly as it was and
 * thrown the diagnostic away with it. `retirementTombstone()` keeps the key
 * DECLARED and unwritable — that is what makes the refusal loud, and it is why
 * the membership legs below are assertions rather than leftovers.
 *
 * ## What was measured — the frame is BASE `72bcd7783`, stated out loud
 *
 * ZERO readers, ⛔ measured with a POINT-ACCESS probe rather than a bare word.
 * Tree-wide on the base, `schema.cancelLabel` / `schema.confirmLabel` /
 * `schema.confirmVariant` each score **0**, against the FIRING CONTROLS on the
 * very renderer under test — `schema.cancelText` = **15** (read at
 * `packages/components/src/renderers/overlay/alert-dialog.tsx:37`) and
 * `schema.actionText` = **5** (read at `:38`). The three zeros are readings of
 * the same instrument on the same file the controls light up.
 *
 * ⛔ A BARE-WORD probe would have lied, and towards "live": these spellings are
 * overloaded across this tree and every OTHER owner is a LIVE key on a
 * DIFFERENT declaration — `FormSchema.cancelLabel`, `objectql.ts`'s
 * `confirmLabel`, `plugin-designer`'s `ConfirmDialog` React props,
 * `plugin-grid`'s `def.confirmLabel`, and `plugin-form`'s `ModalForm` /
 * `DrawerForm`, which BUILD a local `cancelLabel` FROM `schema.cancelText` — the
 * opposite direction. A bare grep reports dozens of readers, none of them on an
 * `alert-dialog` node. `the neighbouring owners are untouched` below is that
 * ruling-out kept as a live assertion rather than as prose.
 *
 * ## The rest-spread near-miss, closed by MEASUREMENT
 *
 * The three keys DO reach the primitive — they are not on `SchemaRenderer`'s
 * strip list, so they ride `componentProps` into the renderer's `...props` and
 * onto `<AlertDialog {...props}>`, the same channel that made
 * `CollapsibleSchema.open` live (objectui#8236). What settles it is a DOM
 * reading, and it lives where a DOM exists:
 * `packages/components/src/__tests__/alert-dialog-footer-keys-liveness-7963.test.tsx`.
 * That file is KEPT and re-pointed, ⛔ not retired with the keys — a retirement
 * does not retire the measurement that justified it. This package cannot see a
 * renderer, so the render-side half is deliberately not duplicated here; what is
 * asserted here is the reading this package CAN take, the renderer's source
 * text.
