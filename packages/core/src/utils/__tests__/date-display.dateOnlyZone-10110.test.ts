 * objectui#10110 — a date-only value names a CALENDAR DAY, so it renders as
 * that day for every viewer, in every zone.
 *
 * ── What was measured ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `2026-08-01` came back from the API as `2026-08-01` and rendered `7月31日`
 * in a console whose machine zone was `America/Los_Angeles` (UTC-7), while the
 * same page in a UTC+8 browser rendered `8月1日`. ECMAScript parses the
 * date-only form as UTC midnight and this module read it back with LOCAL
 * getters, so west of UTC every date-only value lost a day. The relative
 * branch shifted with it: `2026-08-31` read `4天前` on the 3rd.
 *
 * ⭐ A suite that runs in ONE zone cannot see this class at all, and the one
 * zone this repo runs in is the single offset at which the defect is
 * invisible: `vitest.config.mts` pins `TZ=UTC` (objectui#8366). That is
 * presumably how it shipped. So the zone is an INPUT here, driven per case —
 * which is what that config's own header asks for: "Non-UTC coverage, if it
 * is ever wanted, wants an explicit per-case zone — never the runner's
 * ambient one, which is the thing that made this silent."
 *
 * ── Why the zone is driven in a CHILD PROCESS ──────────────────────────────
 * ⚠️ Writing `process.env.TZ` from inside a test does NOT move the zone here,
 * and it fails silently. Measured while writing this file: the root config
 * runs `pool: 'threads'`, a test body therefore runs in a worker thread, and
 * in a worker `process.env` is a plain copy with no native setter behind it —
 * so the assignment lands, `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`
 * still reads `UTC`, and every date-only assertion passes for the wrong
 * reason. A rig with that shape is the phantom version of this very file.
 *
 * So each zone is read from a real child process started WITH `TZ` in its
 * environment, which is the only point at which a zone can still be chosen.
 * The child imports this module's source directly (Node 22 strips the types)
 * and prints one JSON reading; the cases below assert on those readings. The
 * clock is frozen in the child the same way, by a `Date` subclass, because
 * the relative branch is a function of "today". The first case is the rig
 * check: it asserts the child really reports the zone it was given, so a rig
 * that stopped working reds instead of going quietly green.
 *
 * ── Why both directions from UTC ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The wrong repair is an offset that cancels the shift. It makes the reported
 * symptom go away and is wrong twice over: EAST of UTC the UTC-midnight parse
 * already lands on the right day, so a compensating shift breaks what works
 * today; and any hour arithmetic is wrong again at a DST boundary. Hence the
 * controls no offset can satisfy at once:
 *
 *   - `Asia/Shanghai` (UTC+8) and `Pacific/Kiritimati` (UTC+14) must keep
 *     rendering the named day.
 *   - `America/Santiago` on `2026-09-06`, a day whose LOCAL MIDNIGHT DOES NOT
 *     EXIST (clocks jump 00:00 → 01:00), must still render September 6th, and
 *     `America/Los_Angeles` must still read `Yesterday` across the 25-hour day
 *     that ends DST.
 *   - A value that carries a TIME is an instant and must keep converting into
 *     the viewer's zone, including when that moves it to another calendar day:
 *     `2026-08-01T03:00:00.000Z` is `Jul 31` in the west and `Aug 1` in the
 *     east, and a repair that touched instants reds there.
 *
 * ── Directions, predicted in writing BEFORE the run ────────────────────────
 *   Reverting `toDisplayDate` to `new Date(value)`
 *       RED: every case under "the day it names" and "the relative branch",
 *       plus the rollover case. GREEN: the three instant controls and the rig
 *       check — none of them reads the date-only arm.
 *   "Repairing" it by adding the local offset to the parsed instant instead
 *       GREEN in the west; RED on `Asia/Shanghai` / `Pacific/Kiritimati` and
 *       on the instant controls. That is the pair which makes the two halves
 *       independently falsifiable — no single fake fix greens both.
 *   Dropping the `local.setFullYear(year)` line
 *       RED: the two-digit-year case alone.
