 * objectui#8193 — the kanban capability gate asked the `options` bag for the
 * LEGACY lane spelling only.
 *
 * `availableViews` resolved kanban from three rungs: `schema.kanban`'s two
 * spellings, and `schema.options.kanban.groupField`. There was no canonical
 * rung for the bag — so a producer writing the SPEC key into `options.kanban`
 * was invisible to the gate while rendering perfectly, because the render
 * branch merges the bag and resolves `groupByField || groupField`. The gate
 * recognized strictly LESS than what renders.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS WAS LATENT UNTIL objectui#8193 MADE IT REACHABLE, which is why it is
 * fixed alongside a producer change rather than on its own card. `app-shell`'s
 * `ObjectView` writes the view-level kanban config into `options.kanban`, and
 * it had always written the legacy `groupField` — so the missing rung cost
 * nothing. Moving that producer onto the canonical key (the actual subject of
 * objectui#8193) turned the hole into a regression: measured before and after,
 * a bag of `{groupBy, groupField}` offered Kanban and `{groupBy, groupByField}`
 * did not. The toggle would have disappeared from every object view in the
 * product, silently, with the board still rendering correctly if you reached it
 * another way.
 *
 * SAME SHAPE, THIRD TIME: objectui#5042 (`map`) and objectui#7544 (`chart`)
 * were both "the gate and the seam must answer one question", and both were
 * fixed by making the gate ask what the render branch asks. Kanban's render
 * branch resolves `groupByField || groupField` off the MERGED config, so the
 * gate now recognizes the same four combinations that merge.
 *
 * ⛔ NO ALIAS READ WAS REMOVED by this card: it added the canonical rung the
 * bag never had. The alias rungs went later, on their own ruling (objectui#6152
 * round 14); the legacy-bag CONTROL below was re-judged into a refusal arm then.
 *
 * REVERSE VERIFICATION — direction predicted before running, then observed:
 * drop the `schema.options?.kanban?.groupByField` rung and the canonical-bag
 * arms below go RED while every legacy-bag and declared-path CONTROL stays
 * GREEN — the gate keeps answering correctly for every input it already
 * handled. That asymmetry is the point: a "fix" that pushed `kanban` whenever
 * it was whitelisted would also pass the positive arms, so the refusal arms at
 * the bottom are load-bearing.
