/**
 * objectui#3913 — every curated page-block label is a translation key that
 * BOTH locales define, and the key is the one its POSITION implies.
 *
 * ## What was broken
 *
 * `PageBlockInspector`'s chrome went through `t('engine.inspector.pageBlock.*')`
 * from the start; the panel's CONTENTS — the 152 field/option labels and 5
 * `addLabel`s of `block-config.ts` — were English literals handed straight to
 * the field components. A zh-CN admin opening any page block therefore read
 * 「属性」 over a stack of English field names: two languages in one panel, no
 * special data needed to reproduce.
 *
 * ## Why the assertions are two, not one
 *
 * "Does the key exist in both tables?" is the obvious check and it is not
 * enough. The keys are near-identical strings differing by one segment
 * (`…field.object-grid.columns` vs `…field.object-form.columns`), so the
 * realistic mistake when adding a block is not a typo — it is copy-pasting a
 * neighbouring block's key, which EXISTS in both locales and renders a plausible
 * label belonging to a different property. An existence-only check is green for
 * that, and the author reads a correct-looking panel that edits the wrong-named
 * field.
 *
 * So the key is DERIVED here from the label's position in `BLOCK_CONFIG` and
 * compared with what the table stores. Derivation is what makes the mistake
 * mechanically visible, and it is the reason the key shape is positional in the
 * first place rather than semantic.
 *
 *   field label          engine.inspector.pageBlock.field.<blockType>.<name>
 *   nested item label    engine.inspector.pageBlock.field.<blockType>.<array>.<name>
 *   array add button     engine.inspector.pageBlock.add.<blockType>.<name>
 *   select/color option  engine.inspector.pageBlock.option.<fieldName>.<value>
 *   placeholder prose    engine.inspector.pageBlock.placeholder.<blockType>.<name>
 *
 * Option keys omit the block type on purpose (so `format`'s number/currency/
 * percent are translated once and shared by `object-metric` and
 * `element:number`); field keys carry it on purpose, because the same English
 * word needs different Chinese per block — `element:button.label` is a button
 * caption 「按钮文字」 while `page:tabs.items.label` is a tab title 「标签」.
 *
 * Completeness is asserted through `t()` rather than by importing the tables:
 * `t()` returns the key unchanged on a miss, so `t(key, locale) === key` is
 * exactly "this locale has no translation" — measured through the same accessor
 * the component uses, not a private table this test would have to be given.
 *
 * ## objectui#3979 — the `placeholder` column, and why it is only PARTLY keyed
 *
 * #3913 stopped at labels, so the hints under them stayed English: 「图标」 over
 * a box reading `lucide icon name`. The column joins the walk above as a fifth
 * family, with the SAME positional derivation — but only for the 7 placeholders
 * that are prose. The other 10 are example VALUES (`20`, `https://…`, a JSON
 * sample) and are `{ literal: … }` in `block-config.ts`, never keys: translating
 * them would corrupt the thing the author is being told to type.
 *
 * Which kind a placeholder is, is declared in the TYPE (`PlaceholderSpec`), not
 * inferred here — a bare `placeholder: 'lucide icon name'` no longer compiles.
 * What this file adds on top is the part a type cannot state: that the key side
 * is complete in both locales (with the rest of the walk), and that the literal
 * side is an inventory somebody has to argue with before "helpfully" translating
 * a JSON sample. The third describe holds that inventory.
 *
 * ## objectui#8368 — the other direction, and why it is the LAST describe
 *
 * Every assertion above answers "did the key ARRIVE?". None of them can answer
 * "did the retired key LEAVE?" — a leftover key resolves in both locales, so it
 * is green everywhere here by construction. Four renames in a row closed that
 * half with a hand-written pin naming the one key they retired; the last
 * describe replaces the convention with an instrument, scoped to exactly the
 * subset where deadness is mechanically decidable. Its own header states the
 * reader set it measured and, at equal length, what it deliberately does not
 * cover.

/* ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * objectui#8368 — the RETIREMENT direction.
 *
 * Everything above is the ARRIVAL half: a key BLOCK_CONFIG implies must exist
 * in both locale tables. A designer rename owes a second half — the retired key
 * must LEAVE both tables — and until this describe nothing measured it. The two
 * repo-wide i18n gates cannot: `check:i18n-keys` and `check:i18n-dead-keys`
 * both read `packages/i18n/src/locales/`, and `engine.inspector.pageBlock.*`
 * lives only in `metadata-admin/i18n.ts` (which says so in its own header). So
 * each of the four renames so far (objectui#3829, objectui#5212, objectui#8279,
 * objectui#8278) shipped with a HAND-WRITTEN pin naming the one key it retired
 * — a convention, not an instrument, and the fifth rename is one forgotten pin
 * away from leaving dead vocabulary the next author reads as a live surface.
 *
 * ## What "retired" means here, operationally
 *
 * A key is retired when NOTHING CAN REACH IT — not when it merely looks unused.
 * The reader set for this namespace was measured rather than assumed, and it
 * has exactly two members:
 *
 *   1. BLOCK_CONFIG, through the positional derivation this file already
 *      performs. Four families — `field.`, `add.`, `option.`, `placeholder.` —
 *      are produced by nothing else: `SITES` above is the complete enumeration
 *      of what the table can ask for, and the sibling assertions "stores
 *      exactly the key its position implies" and "no label is left as display
 *      text" are what make that enumeration exhaustive rather than a sample.
 *   2. Literal `engine.inspector.pageBlock.…` strings in shipped source —
 *      `PageBlockInspector.tsx`'s panel chrome and `PagePreview.tsx`'s outline
 *      title. These have no position to derive from, so they are read back OUT
 *      of the source, the same way `PageBlockInspector.i18n.test.tsx` reads its
 *      own chrome key list rather than hand-copying it.
 *
 * Measured on this checkout: every one of the 171 `engine.inspector.pageBlock.*`
 * keys in each table is covered by one of those two, and no key is constructed
 * dynamically anywhere (`grep` for a template head under this prefix returns
 * only prose in CHANGELOG.md and comments). That is what makes the namespace a
 * CLOSED WORLD and therefore mechanically decidable.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT cover — say it loudly (objectui#8068)
 *
 * ONLY `engine.inspector.pageBlock.*`. The tables hold 1660 keys across three
 * top-level namespaces (`engine.` 1371, `designer.` 178, `perm.` 111), and the
 * rest of them are NOT a closed world: they are reached through dynamic
 * construction (`engine.fieldType.<type>`, `engine.flowNode.<type>.label` via
 * `translateNodeLabel`, `engine.diagnostics.severity.<level>`, …). Measured
 * before scoping: a literal-footprint sweep over the whole `ENGINE_STRINGS_EN`
 * table finds 226 of 1660 keys (13.6%) with no literal spelling in any non-test
 * source — overwhelmingly LIVE keys the sweep cannot see. A gate over that
 * corpus would cry wolf 226 times on a clean tree and be deleted rather than
 * trusted, which is objectui#4658's own ruling for the pack-side sweep and
 * objectui#8068's argument against instruments that claim more than they check.
 * The honest scope is the subset that is exactly decidable, and it is stated
 * here rather than implied by the assertion names.
 *
 * ## Why test files are excluded from the literal scan — load-bearing
 *
 * `block-config.test.ts` SPELLS the retired keys (`page:header.icon`,
 * `page:accordion.title`, `object-kanban.groupField`) in its own negative pins.
 * Counting test files as readers would make every key this gate exists to catch
 * permanently reachable — the gate would be green by construction. A key read
 * only by a test is not a key a user can see; the same argument
 * `check-i18n-dead-keys.mjs` makes about test-only pack importers.
