 * objectui#6071 — an exclusion reason that claims "no renderer" must be TRUE.
 *
 * ## The drift this closes
 *
 * `PALETTE_EXCLUSIONS` was made an explicit ledger (#2943) so a palette
 * decision is recorded where the next reader will find it. `block-config.
 * test.ts` enforces that every exclusion CARRIES a reason (`reason.length >
 * 10`); nothing enforced that the reason is TRUE. Two of them drifted: the
 * entries for `element:text_input` and `element:record_picker` opened with "no
 * renderer" while both types have had a registered renderer under
 * `namespace: 'element'` all along. The cost is not cosmetic — the ledger is
 * read as the decision record, and #5837 had to re-derive registration state
 * from source precisely because the stated reason could not be trusted.
 *
 * Correcting the two strings fixes today's text. This file pins the CLASS, so
 * the next "no renderer" written over a type that has one fails here instead of
 * being believed for another release.
 *
 * ## Why the assertion is shaped this way
 *
 * The interesting direction is cheap to get wrong. Four hazards, each with its
 * own guard below:
 *
 *  1. **A degenerate (empty) registry passes every negative assertion.** If the
 *     renderer packages were never imported, `ComponentRegistry.get(...)` is
 *     `undefined` for EVERYTHING and "no exclusion claiming no-renderer has a
 *     renderer" holds vacuously — a green that measures nothing. So each
 *     side-effect import below carries a POSITIVE probe proving that package's
 *     registrations actually ran (the same discipline `palette-discussion-
 *     alias.test.tsx` states in its own header: every negative pin carries its
 *     positive half).
 *  2. **A vacuous loop.** If someone reworded every reason so none claims "no
 *     renderer" any more, the class assertion would iterate over nothing and
 *     stay green while the guard silently stopped guarding. `the ledger still
 *     contains a no-renderer claim to check` fails in that case.
 *  3. **Scope is bounded by the import set.** A renderer registered in a
 *     package NOT imported here reads as unregistered, which would let a false
 *     "no renderer" pass.
 *  4. **The import set drifting behind the registrations** — hazard 3 coming
 *     true silently, which is what objectui#7117 measured and what the last
 *     guard below now refuses. See the next section.
 *
 * ## objectui#7117 — the import set had already drifted, and nothing said so
 *
 * Hazard 3 was stated in prose here ("widen the set when a new package starts
 * registering page blocks") and prose was not enough. `app-shell` became such a
 * package twice — #6757 (`global:search`, `global:notifications`) and #7091
 * (`app:launcher`, `nav:menu`) — and the set was not widened either time, so
 * for two ledger keys this file could not see a renderer that exists. Measured
 * on `44ea62d29`: setting `PALETTE_EXCLUSIONS['app:launcher']` to
 * `'no renderer ZZMUTZZ'` — a string that DOES match {@link CLAIMS_NO_RENDERER}
 * — still passed 4/4, while `views/app-launcher-renderer.tsx` registers a
 * renderer for it. A guard passing the exact false claim it exists to refuse.
 *
 * Two things follow, and the second is the one that keeps this from recurring:
 *
 *  - The set is widened to every package that registers a renderer for a
 *    CURRENT ledger key: the six `views/*-renderer.tsx` leaves of this package,
 *    and `@object-ui/plugin-detail` (which registers `record:chatter` — blind
 *    here for the same reason, measured the same way).
 *  - The app-shell half of the import set is CHECKED rather than trusted. `the
 *    import set covers every page block app-shell registers` derives the leaf
 *    list from the directory and fails when a leaf is not imported here — so
 *    the seventh renderer leaf reds this file instead of quietly shrinking its
 *    coverage. A hand-maintained list is exactly what drifted; deriving it is
 *    the point.
 *
 * Why the leaves and not the package barrel: `../../../../index.js` would track
 * the package automatically, but it costs 6105ms to load against 553ms for the
 * leaves (measured on `44ea62d29`, same harness) because it drags the console,
 * marketplace, cloud and diagnostics graphs in with it. This file is a
 * pure-logic gate in the cheap `unit` project, whose whole design point is not
 * paying for graphs it does not touch (`vitest.config.mts`). The derived guard
 * buys the barrel's one real advantage — tracking the package — for 0ms.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT imported
 *
 * `registerPlaceholders()`. It registers the whole `PROTOCOL_COMPONENTS`
 * vocabulary against `PlaceholderRenderer` under `namespace:
 * 'protocol-placeholder'`, which would make this file answer "has a renderer"
 * for types that have only the dashed "Component Placeholder" scaffold —
 * `user:profile` was the measured example, until `@objectstack/spec` 17.3.0
 * retired the type from `PageComponentType` and objectui#7122 dropped its
 * placeholder registration with it. The MECHANISM is unchanged and so is the
 * refusal to opt in; only the illustration went, and it is left named here
 * because it is the reading the argument was built on. This repo's own
 * language is clear that the
 * scaffold is not a renderer: `views/app-launcher-renderer.tsx` describes the
 * state before it existed as "nothing rendered it, so a page that authored it
 * drew a dashed box", with placeholders registered the whole time. Opting in
 * would make the guard assert a falsehood in the opposite direction.
