# Self-test for guard-main-checkout.sh — run it after touching that hook:
#
#   .claude/hooks/guard-main-checkout.selftest.sh
#
# Feeds the hook the same JSON payload shape Claude Code delivers on PreToolUse and asserts
# the block/allow verdict per case. Hermetic: it builds its OWN throwaway git repos, a linked
# worktree of each and a non-repo directory under $TMPDIR, so the matrix never depends on
# which machine or which checkout it runs from. Needs jq and git and nothing else — no
# install, no build, no network. Exit 0 = all cases hold.
#
# Companion to guard-main-checkout-bash.selftest.sh, which covers the Bash half of the same
# worktree-first pair. That matrix is mostly SHELL SPLITTING; this hook parses no shell at
# all — it picks the payload's path key from the tool that sent it and makes a
# PATH-AND-WORKTREE decision — so these cases are derived from what this hook actually
# decides, not ported from the sibling.
#
# PORTED from objectstack's copy of this matrix (objectstack-ai/objectstack, .claude/hooks/
# guard-main-checkout.selftest.sh @ d63c8a2) under objectui#6451, and the port is VERBATIM:
# the two repos' guard-main-checkout.sh differ by 10 diff lines that are all inside comment
# blocks, no executable line differs, and both settings.json route the identical
# Edit|Write|NotebookEdit matcher — so the sibling file was first run here BYTE-FOR-BYTE
# unmodified (via the two env vars below) and returned 87 passed, 0 failed. Not one case
# needed adapting. The only edit below the header is the `worktrees`-segment section, whose
# issue reference is re-pointed at this repo's own card for the same defect.
# ⛔ Keep the two copies converged: a case that has to differ is evidence the HOOKS have
# drifted, and that drift is the finding — not something to paper over here.
#
# Fail-open by default, on purpose: the process cwd AND CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR both default to a
# directory in no repo at all, which is the input on which this hook allows everything. A
# case that expects `block` therefore cannot pass by accident — the verdict can only have
# come from the path in the payload. Sections that need a different default say so.
#
# GUARD_MAIN_CHECKOUT_HOOK points the matrix at a scratch copy of the hook, and
# GUARD_MAIN_CHECKOUT_SETTINGS at a scratch copy of settings.json; that is how the mutation
# runs that prove these cases can fail are driven (see NON-VACUITY at the foot of this file).
# Both default to the real files, so a plain invocation checks the real hook and real wiring.

# ── NON-VACUITY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Each class above was shown to fail against a mutated copy of the hook before being trusted
# to pass against the real one. Reproduce any of them without touching the real hook:
#
#   cp .claude/hooks/guard-main-checkout.sh /tmp/mutant.sh
#   # e.g. delete the linked-worktree escape, which should redden every `allow` in a worktree:
#   perl -0pi -e 's{^\[ "\$\(canon_dir .*\n}{}m' /tmp/mutant.sh
#   GUARD_MAIN_CHECKOUT_HOOK=/tmp/mutant.sh .claude/hooks/guard-main-checkout.selftest.sh
#
# The mutations used, one per class: drop the linked-worktree escape (core verdict) · drop
# the nearest-existing-ancestor walk (new-file class) · replace dirname "$file" with
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (the file's-own-repo class) · drop the OS_ALLOW_MAIN_EDITS line (escape
# hatch) · turn the no-path else branch into exit 0 (the fails-closed class) · rename the key
# in the grep fallback (the jq-less class) · change the final exit 2 to exit 0 (every block) ·
# point NotebookEdit's row at file_path (the notebook class) · delete NotebookEdit's row
# altogether (the wiring pair, which reds on the matcher relation and not on a verdict) ·
# replace the drift block with the project-dir fallback (the schema-drift class).
