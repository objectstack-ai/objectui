/**
 * Retirement pin — `FilterUISchema.filters[].operator` is REFUSED on the
 * `filter-ui` node (objectui#10611, ADR-0049 enforce-or-remove).
 *
 * ## The failure this pin exists to prevent
 *
 * Both published faces declared a per-filter `operator` (a seven-member enum on
 * the mirror, the same union on the TS face) and the docs page taught it, but
 * `filter-ui`'s renderer never read it: it picks each control from `type` and
 * reports a change as a field → value record with no operator in it (a host
 * `onChange` function receives that bare record; only the authored window
 * event's `detail` is `{ values }`), and it does no matching of its own. So
 * `operator: 'gt'`, a member of that enum, type-checked and parsed green
 * through `objectui validate`; a nonsense id was refused by the enum and did
 * not type-check; and both rendered and emitted exactly what a filter without
 * it does.
 * The render reading and the producer census are recorded on the card's pull
 * request as a one-time measurement; this file is the instrument that keeps the
 * contract.
 *
 * ## Why a tombstone and not a deletion
 *
 * `operator` sits on the `filters[]` ELEMENT, a plain `z.object`, which STRIPS
 * an undeclared key (it is not the node's `.passthrough()` — that one KEEPS
 * it). Either way a deleted member would have been a silent accept; block (c)
 * pins the element's strip on a misspelling, so the reason is a reading and not
 * prose.
 *
 * ## How refusals are asserted
 *
 * By the issue ENVELOPE — `code` and `path`, and that it is the ONLY issue, so a
 * refusal cannot ride on some other failure of the same document — at the public
 * door `safeValidateSchema` (what `objectui validate` / `objectui check` run) and
 * on the mirror. The wording is not pinned; that the message and the published
 * `.describe()` metadata are one string is.
 *
 * The `@ts-expect-error` directive in block (d) is REAL enforcement: this
 * package type-checks its tests through `tsconfig.test.json`, so re-widening the
 * member fails the build on the unused directive (TS2578). A green `vitest` run
 * is NOT evidence about it — type assertions are erased before it runs.
