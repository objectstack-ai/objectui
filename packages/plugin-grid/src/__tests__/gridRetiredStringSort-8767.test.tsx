 *
 * `object-grid` REFUSES the retired string `sort` clause (objectui#8767).
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * The #8221 ruling (decision batch #77) retired the legacy OData-ish string
 * clause: one spelling, the array, everywhere. PR #8758 narrowed the shared
 * sink `convertSortToQueryParams` so a string that still arrives at runtime is
 * refused out loud and the query carries no `$orderby`.
 *
 * `ObjectGrid` never went through that sink. It reads `schema.sort` at its own
 * site and lowers it with private code, so after #8758 a bare `object-grid`
 * still forwarded a string verbatim to `$orderby` while the SAME key routed
 * through `object-view` was refused with a diagnostic — one key meaning two
 * things depending on which block you are on. That is precisely the shape the
 * ruling rejected when it declined option A by name:
 *
 *   > per-block arms would make one key mean different things on different
 *   > blocks and keep a spelling the spec already refuses on one of them.
 *
 * ## What these tests pin, and what they deliberately do NOT
 *
 * Route C, as ruled: the string arm is refused with #8758's own reporter, and
 * NOTHING else about this block moves. So the file has two halves, and the
 * second is what stops it passing by refusing everything:
 *
 *   1. a string `sort` reaches no `$orderby`, and says so once per spelling;
 *   2. the array arm still lowers to the very same `"field order"` join string
 *      this block has always sent — byte for byte, single- and multi-key.
 *
 * The join string is the wire shape route B would change and route C keeps.
 * The header-arrow reader `parseSchemaSort` and the export path read the same
 * key and are untouched here; they belong to that other card.
