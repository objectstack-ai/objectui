 *
 * objectui#6939's remainder — the `filter-builder` row's fourth divergence,
 * measured in BOTH directions because this repair pulls two ways at once.
 *
 * ## What changed in the corpus
 *
 * Three catalog entries authored `conditions[].operator` in the spec's ALIAS
 * table (`eq` / `lt` / `gt`) while `FilterOperatorSchema` declares the spec's
 * canonical members (`equals` / `less_than` / `greater_than`). Every one of
 * those documents therefore failed `safeValidateSchema`. The seven spellings
 * were rewritten to the declared vocabulary — contract-first, the protocol
 * being the side that is right — and ⛔ the enum was not widened by one member
 * to meet them.
 *
 * ## The two directions, and why neither alone is the acceptance
 *
 *   - **NEW — it validates.** The property this card ADDS. Pinned below per
 *     entry, and paired with a refusal control so `.success` cannot go green
 *     by a mirror that accepts everything.
 *   - **PRESERVED — it renders the same.** The property this card must NOT
 *     break. ⚠️ objectui#6318's rule is that *a "correction" that renders
 *     identically proves the edit was wrong*; that rule was written where the
 *     correction repaired a BROKEN render. Here it inverts: objectui#7561 (PR
 *     #9305) had already routed the operator trigger's identity comparison
 *     through `normalizeFilterOperator`, so all three dialects already drew
 *     their label — the alias spellings were validation-broken, not
 *     render-broken. ⇒ a render that MOVES is this card's failure signal, and
 *     that is what the identity legs below exist to catch.
 *
 * The "before" arm is not read from git history: it is reconstructed in memory
 * from the same tree by swapping only the operator spellings back, so the proof
 * keeps working in a checkout that never saw the old bytes.
 *
 * ## ⛔ The open half, recorded rather than repaired
 *
 * The dropdown EMITS a third vocabulary — its own camelCase ids
 * (`notEquals`, `greaterThan`) — which this mirror also refuses. A filter a
 * user edits in the UI and stores is therefore refused exactly as these
 * fixtures once were. That is the larger half of the same defect and no card
 * owns it; it is pinned here as a refusal so it cannot go quiet, and ⛔ it is
 * not ruled here.
